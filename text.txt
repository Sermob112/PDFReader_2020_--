•	
real time measuring of ship’s trim, heel, hull 
deflection (hog/sag) and torsion
•

and at the centre-line, corrected for deflection, 
torsion and sea water density
•	
presentation of hydrostatics corrected for trim

Hull coatings:  Self-polishing copolymer sylil 
acrylate antifouling
For funnel a transom polysiloxane paint with 
following characteristics:
•	
High volume solids compared to traditional
polyurethanes results in lower VOC per litre
and reduced impact on the applicator and
the environment
•	
High loss retention ensuring a very long-
lasting beautiful appearance. The durability
of this finish is also supported by the very
good abrasion and chemical resistance
ensuring the structure looks new for a long
time
