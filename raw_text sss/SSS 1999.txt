AFRIKA: pelagic factory 
trawler heads for the tropics 
Afriku, one of ihe most recent pelagic 
stem trawlers to join the Dutch fleet, 
is designed to operate in (he tropics, fishing 
mainly for sardineila and horse mackerel 
in West African waters and operating for 
much of the year from the Canary Islands. 
Built by YVC at the Capclle-aan-den-
IJssel yard, the 640()dwt vessel has an 
overall length of 126.20m and a beam of 
11.02m. Built on much the same lines as 
conventional freezer trawlers in the Dutch 
fleet, 
it 
has a long foredeck with 
superstructure close to the stern, leaving a 
trawl deck aft of the wheelhousc. 
Accommodation, mess ajid galley spaces 
are located in the superstructure, with the 
twin level factory deck in the aft section. 
An .VIAK 6M601C main engine, 
developing 7,500kW at 425 rcv/miu turns 
a Berg 3,80Gmm diameter CP propeller at 
166 rev/min inside a Hcxli nozzle via a 
Renk Taeke gearbox. This configuration 
gave a speed of 18 knots on sea trials. A 
700k\V how thmster is also filled. 
Auxiliary power is also derived from 
MAK units - a 9M25 set. rated 2.6IOkW 
at 720 rev/rain and an 8M20, raied 1,360 
kW at 900 rev/min. An AC Leroy Somer 
shaft generator develops 4,200kVA and a 
DC Bakker Sliedrecht shaft generator 
produces 770kW. 
Over 1.400 tonnes of heavy fuel and 280 
tonnes of gas oil can be carried, while 
ballast tanks will hold 805 tonnes and Ihe 
fresh water tanks on hoard have a 120-
lonne capacity. 
The fish room, which is on two levels, 
with a ibrklift on board for managing frozen 
products, can hold 172,100 cartons of sea 
frozen fish. A pair of Hydramaskin cranes 
is mounted on the port side of ihe Foredeck 
for unloading catches through hatches that 
are offset lo pori. minimising disruption 
to the factory deck on ihe level below. 
Fishing gear is handled over the stern 
using winches supplied by Brusselle 
Marine Industries, The twin trawl winches, 
powered by Bakker .Sliedrecht 350kW 
motors, each have a 4.000m capacity and 
an eleventh layer pull ofSlOkN. Twin net 
drams are used to hold two of the vessel's 
five trawls ready for use. Other gear is 
stored alt. with iwo more Hydramaskin 
cranes located on the port side of ihe trawl 
deck and al the top of Ihe stem gantry for 
handling fishing gear. 
Additional winches include a pair of uod 
end winches from Brusselle and two net 
sounder cable winches from Karnioy 
mounted just aft of the wheelhouse. Deck 
operations are commanded from a console 
at ihe back of the wheelhouse with a full 
view over the deck. 
All of ihe winches are controlled from 
this position, and a PA system is fitted for 
communication with the deck crew. A 
Marelec trawl control system is fitted to 
monitor warp tension and length, and lliis 
has a monitor in the central wheelhouse 
console, with a repeater at the deck control 
position. 
Caichcs taken by vessels of this type are 
relatively sensitive species such as 
sardinelia and mackerel, and instead of 
bringing bags of IIsh on board, catches are 
pumped aboard using a Kamioy fish pump. 
The fish are taken through a dewalmng 
system before passing to the tanks below, 
which have a maximum holding capacity 
of 540 tonnes. 
The Grenco refrigeration system on 
board makes it possible to chill the 
maximum capacity through 32°C in eight 
hours. A slurry ice plant is capable of 
producing 40 tonnes/day, and this is used 
for cooling fish in the tanks and the 
intermediate cooling bins. The whole of 
the refrigeration system in ihe ship can be 
monitored and controlled from the 
engineer's control room. 
The twin level factory deck was supplied 
by Machinefabriek van Rijn, and has a 
vacuum pump system for transporting fish. 
Fish are brought from the tanks via a 
grading section where they can be sorted 
according lo species and weight and held 
in the intermediate cooling bins. 
All of the cateh is frozen in Jaekstonc 
vertical plate freezers served by three lanes 
of overhead conveyors. A Marelec quality 
control station is lilted next to the grader, 
allowing the factory deck crew to keep 
Significant Small Craft of 1999 

constant track of the grading weights. 
There are 24 vertical plate freezers 
on the lower factory deck, and a 
further 16 freezers on the deck above. 
Fish are carried to the upper deck 
using 
an 
extended 
series 
of 
conveyors, and are delivered to the 
freezers in the same way. 
Frozen blocks from the freezers are 
carried to a packing area along a 
secondary system of conveyors at 
waist level, where they are boxed and 
strapped. An extended conveyor 
brings frozen blocks down from the 
top factory deck. Each block is 
weighed 
individually, 
and 
a 
computer-controlled inkjel is used to 
mark each box with its contents. The 
boxing machine has been built to run 
with a minimum of manpower, and 
only needs to be loaded with empty 
boxes to run automatically. It is 
controlled 
using 
a 
PLC 
(Programmable Logic Control) 
computer, and a similar control unit 
is used to manage the factory deck's 
vacuum pumps. 
An AFAK Techniek wrapping 
machine has been fitted, and this 
seals each carton offish into a plastic 
wrapper. When strapped and 
marked, the boxes are carried by lift 
down to the fish rooms and stowed 
on pallets. Depending on the type of 
fish, and the mix of species, a crew 
of ten should be able to run the 
factory deck at full capacity. Freezing 
time for each freezer is four hours, 
giving a total freezing capacity of 350 
tonnes per day. 
The wheelhouse is laid out with a 
control console aft for the deck 
machinery, and a horseshoe console 
forward. Side by side skippers' chairs 
have a full view of the twin Furuno 
radar screens, and an array of fish 
finding equipment. Two colour 
sounders are from JRC, and a Furuno 
paper sounder have their displays 
built into the console. A Furuno colour 
scanning sonar is at the centre, and 
there are further displays for the trawl 
mounted Wesmar and Simrad sonar 
sets. A Scanmar cableless system is 
also fitted for monitoring catches. 
Controls for the sonars are built into 
the central console between the two 
skippers' seats, along with throttle 
and steering controls. 
A pair of chartplotters linked to 
DGPS positioning 
systems 
is 
provided with displays in the control 
console, and another GPS receiver 
and a navtex receiver are located by 
the chart table 
VHF and MF/HF communications 
sets are built into the port side of the 
console, 
and 
a 
separate 
communications room on the port side 
of the wheelhouse contains the 
satellite communications equipment, 
as well as fax and weather fax.

ATLANTIDE: 1930's 
yacht sails again 
The 34,8m sailing yacht Atlantide 
deserves merit amongst significant 
small vessel deliveries for ]999, not 
because it is innovative in design but 
because of the painstaking effort involved 
in restoring it. When owner, Thomas 
Perkins, 
a 
venture capitalist from 
California discovered the vessel in Malta 
il was in a deplorable condition. Some two 
years on. however, il floats again with all 
of the elegance and charm it flaunted in 
the 1930s. 
Built to an original Alfred Mylne design. 
Atlantide lias had a colourful history since 
being launched at the Phillips & Son yard 
in Dartmouth, including participation in 
the Dunkirk evacuation as part of the 
renowned Little Ships Armada. 
With naval architect Ken Freivokh 
tasked to produce restoration plans, 
Manoel Island Yacht Yard (the small boat 
wing of Malta Drydocks) was asked to 
repair (he steelwork. In the event, sonic 
90 per cent of the steel in the hull had to 
be replaced, a task which took a year Co 
complete. 
The interior o( the yacht was conceived 
by the Freivokh team in !930's art deco 
style to match the period of its early days. 
This involved use of elaborate marquetry 
and LaliLjue glass and the considerable 
research carried out inspired some unique 
artwork, as can be seen in the internal 
panelling. A notable example is the ornate 
nymph sand-blasted into glass on one of 
the dining room bulkheads. This is

In 1998 Atkmxide was shipped as deck cargo to the UK yard of

ambitious designs and engineers could work on the onboard 
machinery. This included removing and refitting ihe two 23Ohp 
vintage Gardner 8L3B engines, deck work, systems installation, 
creation of a new leak wheelhouse and major work lo form a fully 
filled galley and extensive crew quarters for eight. 
C&C Designs, based in Norfolk. L'K, was appointed lo fit out 
the social areas of the vessel based on its previous success in 
refitting Paul Getty's yacht Tatitha G. The projed involved the 
installation of 1,500ft1 of teak. 14 miles of cable and 470 lights. 
This element of the project also took 12 months. 
Now fully restored and embellished. Atlantide will be based in

BONANZA EXPRESS: 
Weight-saving techniques 
make for speedy Ro-Pax 
Built for operation in the Canary Islands 
by leading Spanish ferry operator 
Lineas Fred Olsen SA. Bonanza Express 
was launched at the end of January '99 
from I neat Tasmania's giant Coverdales 
shipbuilding facility at Prince ofWales Ray 
near Hobait. 
The 96m wavepiercing passenger/ 
vehicle catamaran is a near sister of Incat's 
first dedicated Ro-Pax vessel Devi/Cat, 
which now operates on 'IT Line's summer 
service between Melbourne anil George 
Town. Australia. Bonanza Express entered 
service last April on the 35nm route 
between the ports of Santa Cruz de 
Tenerife and Agaele on the nearby island 
of Gran Canada, reducing travel time 
between the two islands from two hours 
15 minutes to just 60 minutes. 
Flexibility 
and payload are 
the 
characteristics thai most distinguish [neat's 
first 96m vessels and Bonanza Express 
incorporates several new features enabling 
it U) transport significant numbers of heavy 
vehicles. 
Perhaps the most remarkable I'act about 
the ship is that it 
is almost capable of 
carrying its own weight. This equates to 
around 300dwt, which can be carried as a 
broad mix of light and heavy road freight. 
Such an achievement has been made 
possible by a diligent approach to weigh) 
minimisation during Construction, coupled 
wi!h a subtle re-design of the 'Jim class 
hull. 
Weight reduction is largely due lo the 
extensive use of aluminium extrusion. An 
extruded hollow box planking was 
developed to ensure nine-tonne axle 
loadings for the main vehicle deck and 
tunnel underside plaling is strong yel light 
in weight due to the use of corrugated 
aluminium. Other savings were made with 
non-structural superstructure sule panels, 
which were bonded with adhesives rather 
than by welding and could, therefore, be 
thinner and tighter, 
Designated as a Car Ferry B [neat 051, 
the vessel has open Foredeck and stern, 
allowing adequate natural ventilation to the 
vehicle deeks. This policy led to a 
considerable saving, not only in terms of 
structural weight bui also by permitting the 
omission of normally mandatory items 
such as 
structural 
fire 
protection. 
ventilation fans, fire dampers, overhead 
fixed sprinkler systems and additional 
lighting. 
Further structural weight savings were 
achieved by reducing the physical size of 
the passenger cabin and wheelhouse. With 
a total capacity of 755 persons, mosi of 
the passenger accommodation is on a single 
tier with (he wheelhouse positioned well 
all. above the exclusive panoramic sky 
lounge. 
To eater for the increase in passenger 
numbers over the first 96m vessel. 
Bonanza Express has an enlarged sky 
lounge incorporating a cafe-bar, crew 
facilities and toilets. Seating is arranged 
in pairs with the forward part of the area, 
designated for first class passengers. 
comprising 62 Beurleaux Ocean Fxeculive 
aircraft style seats. Double seating also 
extends aft along each side of the vessel 
below the wheelhousc. 
A central stairway forward leads down 
lo Tier 2. emerging just aft of the self-
service bar and cafe where travellers can 
buy beer and spirits as well as a wkle 
variety 
of 
hoi 
and 
cold 
food-
Accommodation comprises Beurteaux tub 
style sealing in clusters of four around 
Significant Small Craft oi-
1999 

wood-grain laminate tables. The 
main scaling area features cushioned 
rcclincrs in 2-4-2 configurations and 
ihe forward lounge, the most popular 
.seating area due to its views over the 
ship's bow, has 158 seats in pairs. 
Vehicle access is via a shore-baseil 
stern ramp or ramps, the transom 
arrangements being designed to 
allow ramps providing a minimum 
of four lanes. In total they offer 330 
lane metres at 2.7m wide x 4.3m high 
for heavy, high and wide vehicles and 
370 car lane metres at 2.3m wide. 
This gives Bonanza Express the 
flexibility to carry 240 ears and no 
heavy vehicles, 12 road freight 
trailers with 180 curs or 24 road 
trailers with 85 cars. While the 
maximum deadweight capacity of 
SOO tonnes is one key lo achieving 
these freight loads, it is ihe provision 
of moveable mezzanine vehicle 
decks that allows ihe ship to offer 
the necessary lane metres required 
for maximum car loading as well as 
offering the headroom demanded by 
oversize freight vehicles. 
Deck officers operate ihe vessel 
more like 
an 
aircraft 
ihan 
a 
traditional ocean-going ship. A 
surprisingly small raised control 
station has large outward raked 
windows fore and aft lo reduce glare 
and give all-round visibility. A 
central aft-facine docking console in 
the control station obviates the need 
fbx bridge wings and their associated 
structural weight. 
The stau'on is tilled with the latest 
in 
electronic, 
navigation 
and 
communication equipment to comply 
with High Speed Craft Code Sea 
Area A2. During normal operations

DC 1500: Hong Kong five give 
chase to smugglers 
Designing a sea-kindly, low noise fast 
Interceptor craft for the Hong Kong 
Marine Police called for the extensive 
boatbuilding skills of Dutch yard Damen 
Shipyards and the offshore power boa! 
expertise of UK firm Cougartek Design. 
The result, designated the Damen 
Cougartek 1500. is capable of speeds in 
excess of 60 knots, making il well able to 
catch up with smugglers. Five vessels have 
been completed. 
liuili in accordance with Damen's ISO 
9001 quality regulations with supervision 
from surveyors of the Bong Kong Marine 
Department, the ultra fast DC 1500s 
measure 14.57m x 2.91m x 1.80m. An 
aluminium superstructure was seleeied in 
preference to materials such as FRP for 
durability and ease of maintenance and 
retrofit A deepV hard chine hull form has 
been incorporated to enhance sea-keeping 
and handling and lo provide a safe working 
environment when the craft is racing at 
high speeds. 
Power is supplied by three Mereruiser 
HP 500 Bulldog gasoline engines driving 
four Bravo One IIP slerndrives via cardan 
shafts. A combined output of 1.119kW is 
achieved. Noise reduction at speeds of up 
to 45 knots is aided by a special exhaust 
system which forces the exhausts to 
discharge under water, through the 
sterndrives. When higher speeds are 
required. 
I he

lo 
discharging through the transom. 
Due to the demanding role of the vessels, 
maintenance of the engines is made simple 
and efficiency is aided by a quick 
replacement syslem. whereby a new unit 
can be installed within the hour using a 
vertical Hfl-in/oul procedure. Fittings used 
include special connectors, which can be 
simply plugged and unplugged. All iluee 
engines are identical, thus minimising the 
level of slock and spare parts required This 
feature also extends to other essential 
equipment such as the electrical bilge 
pumps, which are also Tilted with plugs 
for ease of installation/replacement. The 
vessels are equipped with a set of lifting

positioning and are located well inboard 
in the self-draining cockpit. Control 
consoles are located aft and forward and 
are surrounded by a walkway for 
unrestricted movement, essential when 
preparing to board vessels. 
The forward console has seating for 
two, with helmsman positioned to port 
and boarding officer to starboard. 
Gearshift and throttle controls are fitted 
centrally and the arrangement provides 
unobstructed views over the bow. The 
aft console is also for two and houses 
the monitoring equipment for the 
propulsion system, as well as an extensive 
array 
of navaids. 
Communication 
equipment is once again fitted centrally and 
general communication between crew is 
via helmet-mounted voiceducers. 
Damen has also introduced a great deal 
of flexibility in the onboard set-up, with 
the option for a number of differing cabin 
layouts to suit particular customer 
operating requirements e.g. choice 
between open cockpit and fully-enclosed 
cabin. Such flexibility, coupled with the 
safe working environment and precise 
handling -
the craft is capable of 
maintaining a speed in excess of 45 knots 
in Sea State 3 conditions - enables a lot of 
work to be undertaken at close quarters. 
The vessels will usually operate in pairs 
with one utilised as the lead interdiction 
boat, while the other provides crucial back 
up. As well as operating on a stand-alone 
basis, the IX 1500 can also be used in a 
mother and daughter arrangement, linked 
up, for example, with a patrol vessel acting 
in a surveillance, command/control role. 
The last two boats in the series were 
commissioned in October '99 and the 
completion of the contract continues the 
strong relationship between Damen and 
China, with the Dutch yard having already 
built more than 30 patrol vessels for the 
Hong Kong police and customs authorities.

FAR SOVEREIGN: packed with 
power for offshore tasks 
Major 
offshore vessel operator, Farstad 
Shipping, added the powerful UT 
741 AHTS/towing vessel Far Sovereign 
to its fleet in late "99. Mulii-flineiiona] In 
Order to undertake a wide range of offshore 
support tasks, the vessel is equipped with 
a main lowing winch capable of 500 tonnes 
maximum pull and has a bollard pull of 
280 tonnes. 
Measuring 85.20m x 20.50m. Far 
Sovereign was built in Norway at the 
Langsten Slip yard in Toinrefjord and has 
been operated in recenl months by 
European Marine Contractors (EMC) for 
ploughing and trenching operations. 
At the hear! of the new ship are four 
Ulstein Bergen diesels in two father and 
son arrangements, with a total output of 
27.400hp, turning two Ulstein propellers 
in fixed no/./.les. At (he bow there is a 
l,620kW azimuthing thruster, together 
with a l,200k\V tunnel Sinister, whilst aft 
two 833kW tunnel thrusters combine to 
give the vessel outstanding manoeuvring 
capabilities. 
All of these devices, plus the Ulstein 
high lift rudders, are linked to a fully 
redundant Kongsberg Simrad SDP21 
dynamic positioning system which is in 
turn interfaced with spotbeam. DGPS. 
tautwire, laser and H1PAP systems to 
ensure reliable and accurate station 
keeping. According to the owners, the 
vessel has a maximum free-running speed 
of 17 knots. 
The vessel's considerable electrical 
needs are met by two 3,000kVA shaft 
generators, and two Caterpillar driven 
generator sets of 715kW each. 
Apart from the visually obvious 
helicopter pad built up over the bow and 
designed to accept a Super Puma 
AS332L2, Fur Sovereign is dominated by 
a substantial A-frame at the stern, a cluster 
of cranes and other items of deck 
machinery ringing the art working deck. 
With a 160-tonne SWL. the A-frame can 
be used for all manner of deepwaler 
construction projects but most notably, as 
in the vessel's current operation, deploying 
EMC's pipe trenching and backfilling 
ploughs. These can be lowered over the 
pipe or trench with accurate positioning 
facilitated by real time sonar and video 
systems. The trenching plough is capable 
of lowering a pipeline of up to 1.4m 
diameter into a trench of up to 2m in depth. 
The devices are able to operate at depths 
of 400m and are controlled from a special 
dedicated operations room. Power and 
telemetry signals are passed from this 
cabin via an umbilical to a subsea 
electronics pod mounted on the ploughs. 
A 100-lonne SWL heavy lift offshore 
crane is mounted on the port side of the 
aft deck while three smaller ones occupy 
positions at the other corners. The main 
winch has a maximum pull of 500 tonnes 
and houses up to 6,100m of 90mm 
diameter wire. 
A 7m \ 5m working union pool is 
incorporated into the 680m3 of high load 
open deck space of the vessel's main deck 
and 
a 
removable 
modular 
ROV 
deployment deck can provide an additional 
320m- of equipment storage room.

HUMBER CALLISTO: super star 
joins pilot fleet 
Associated British Porls at Hull, 
responsible for pilot services on ihe 
River Humber. has Iradilionally operated 
Scania powered twin-screw Nelsons and 
currently has a fleet of three with another 
in reserve. Tradition has. however, now 
been casl aside by Bevan Thomas, marine 
engineering manager of ABP Hull, with 
the delivery of Humher Cattish), a triple-
engined waleijei driven vessel whieh, it is 
claimed, marks a watershed lor pilot boat 
design and construction. 
Designed by Alaslair Cameron of 
Camarc Ltd and built on the Isle of Wight 
by Souter Marine, the 17.2m x 4.60m craft 
owes much in overall concept to a series 
of longer Rotterdam pilo! boats from ihe 
same designer and built by Engelacr in 
Holland. Waicrjet propulsion, advanced 
double chine hull, the bright livery and all-
round tendering system have their roots in 
the Dutch boats but the three-engine/ 
waterjei propulsion system is, according 
to Thomas, a first for a pilot boat. 
Three Scania DIN engines, each 
developing 6lX)hp at 2,100 rev/min. are 
located across the boat aft with the two 
wing engines silling slightly forward of the 
centre unit. All three are direct coupled 
(no gearboxes) to Hamilton 362 waterjets 
using Centa flexible couplings and drive 
shafts. This arrangement gives a fully laden 
(two crew, ten passengers/pilots and 2,000 
litres of fuel) continuous operating speed 
Of 32 knots and a top speed of 35 knots, 
well exceeding expectations. Commented 
Thomas: "!l would have been difficult to 
reach these speeds by using two larger 
engines because of the increased weight 
of (he engines and associated systems." A 
major advantage of waterje! propulsion is 
Ihe outstanding manoeuvrability when 
approaching and leaving large ships in 
motion and the triple arrangement offers 
flexible operating speed alternatives. 
Cameron's double chine hull has been 
proven on a number of vessels since its 
first development in the mid-eighties. It 
combines a number of advantages 
including finer entry in the forward 
sections, efficient spray rails to keep the 
deck dry and dampen motions in heavy seas 
(important attributes in a pilot boat) and a 
more scakindly shape in the forward 
slamming ni"eas. A chine shape at Ihe aft 
end also gives stability in following seas. 
The wheelhouse/saloon is mounted on 
six anti-vibration mounts and lo further 
reduce noise and vibration levels. Halyard 
Marine & Industrial was called in to design 
and manufacture a complete exhaust 
system with the task of reducing levels to 
around 7ridB(A) in the deckhouse. The 
effect of the Halyard system, which 
incorporates modular high risers with high-
temperature silicone bellows and specially 
designed in-line silencers, has been to 
bring the level down to 71 dB(A). 
A major innovative feature of the boat 
is a stern mounted man overboard recovery 
device designed jointly by Cameron and 
Bevan. Using a small remotely controlled 
winch, a metal mesh and tubular scoop 
running in a channel over the stern can he 
lowered into the water to pick upthe victim 
and raise him/her above deck in the prone 
position. The fendering system is also 
unique being a further development, by 
Camarc, of the original 'Popsafe' system 
used on the earlier Dulch boats. The basic 
principle of holding a tubular rubber fender 
in posilion around the hull by a tensioned 
wire rope is retained but the recess in 
which the tube sits is now formed from 
large 
sections of elastomer foam 
mouldings. Mechanical fastenings around 
the hull, and their weakening effect, are 
thus 
eliminated except where the 
tensioning points are located on the 
transom. A Hadrian pilot rail system is 
fitted lo the foredeek. 
The 
wheelhouse. 
which 
is 
air 
conditioned by a Crusair/Taylor Made 
Environmental syslem. provides excellent 
all-round visibility with an abundance of 
windows, supplied by Seaglaze Marine, 
especially in ihe vital overhead area. Three 
Hcpworth pantograph wipers are lined lo 
the front screens whilst two pendulum 
systems keep the side screens clear.

RT INNOVATION CLASS: 
Rotor' tugs adopt unique 
tractor concept 
One 
of the most intriguing tug concepts 
in recent years became reality in 
January '99 when RT Innovation and RT 
Pioneer, the first in a series of four, were 
delivered lo Dutch operator Kotug. 
Designated "Rolor" lugs, the initial duo -
built in Spain ;it Aslilleros Balenciaga -
were .soon lo be followed by RT Spirit and 
RT Mat>ic. 
Conceived Kid patented by Ton Kooren, 
president of Rotterdam based Kolug -
Sleepdienst Adrinan Kooren 13V -
the 
Rotor tug represents a new concept in lu» 
design. Al its heart, the concept is a unique 
tractor tug propulsion system utilising three 
main engines, each driving a fully 
azimuthing 
propulsion 
unit. 
Two 
propulsion units are located Forward of the 
centreline, 
in 
the 
normal 
tractor 
con figuration, with the third unit aft of the 
centreline replacing the traditional skeg. 
This seemingly complex arrangement 
oilers a number of Significant advantages, 
particularly in the close quarter? ship-
handling role. 
The Rotor tug has the ability lo turn 
rapidly in its own length and apply almost 
all of its bollard pull in any direction -
including sideways. The lack of a 
substantial skeg reduces resistance to 
turning and cuts down the influence of a 
ship's propeller wash when working in 
close proximity to large vessels underway. 
With 6,300hp installed in a 31m hull and 
a bollard pull of 75 tonnes, the Rotor tug 
is one of the most powerful and compact 
harbour lugs in existence. In fact. Kotug 
claims that if a breakdown occurs on one 
engine or propulsion system, the tug can 
remain operative with some 50 tonnes of 
bollard pull still available. 
Construction of the series has involved 
three shipyards. The hull and all major 
steelwork For RT 
Magic was completed by 
Couslrueciones Navales P Freire SA in 
Vigo, Spain, and Fit-out and completion 
undertaken by the Padmos Shipyard al 
Stellendam in Holland. RT Spirit was also 
ordered from Freire and handed over in 
February '99. Aslilleros Balenciaga 
delivered RT Innovation ami RT Pioneer 
as previously mentioned. All four tugs are 
registered under the Dutch flag and classed 
GL+100A5 - "E TUG" +MC.E Am. 
Measuring 31.61m \ 
1 2.00m. each 
Rotor tug has a heavily built single chine 
steel hull and a semi-raised forecastle. No 
underwater skeg is 
Tilted but some 
protection is provided io tlie propellers and 
lor docking purposes by guard plalcs and 
struts. Three very small llns located under 
the stern enhance directional stability. 
Three Caterpillar 3516B DT-TA main 
engines are installed, each with a 
maximum continuous rating of 2,100hp 
running at 1.600 rev/min. Each engine 
drives a Schottel SRP 1212 FP, Fully 
azimuthing propulsion unit, incorporating 
a iive-bkidedrWed pitch propeller oi'2.15m 
diameter and a Kort noz/le. Power is 
transmitted through Twin Disc Type ."i()00-
2LD Marine Control Drive (MCD) units. 
The main engines are situated side by side 
across the engine room, with the outboard 
engines coupled to the forward Schottel 
units and the centre engine driving the alt 
unit. On trials the lugs produced a bollard 
pull ahead of 15 tonnes and 73.S tonnes

Towing equipment is substantial 
and the after deck is dominated by a 
Ridderinkhof TW-H-300 'waterfall' 
type hydraulic main towing winch 
with three declutchable drums. The 
tlilI width upper drum accommodates 
650m of 56mm diameter steel wire 
rope, with a 20m Nylon (spring) of 
100mm diameter. Each lower drum, 
used for ship-handling, curries 200m 
of 56mm sleel wire rope, with a lOrn 
Nylon spring and 48mm diameter steel 
wire pennant. On (he tbredeck is a 
Ridderinkhof AMW-H-236 combined

The winch has ;\ single drum, tor a 
200m towline with the necessary 
spring and pennant, iwo declutchable 
chain lifters and two fixed warping 
heads. Both towing winches have 
pneumatic controls and can be

the Schottei propulsion controls in the 
tugs is unique. Each propulsion unit 
has its own manual controller for thrust 
direction and propeller speed while a 
fourth 'Mastcrpilot' controller enables 
any combination of units to be directed 
in unison. The master can. therefore, 
choose the most suitable combination 
for the Operation he is earning out. In 
much the same way. the Anschutz 
Pilotstar D autopilot can be coupled 
to one. (wo or all three propulsion 
units. For example, at sea, the forward 
propulsion units are connected to the 
autopilot and the stern unit fixed in 
the straight-ahead position. All of the 
Kolug captains involved in the 
operation of the lugs were given 
extensive simulator training by Marine 
Safety Rotterdam BV. along with 
pilots and many others involved with 
the introduction of the new vessels. 
Crew accommodation is lilted out 
lo a very high standard. The tugs will 
normally work in harbour with a crew

MARCIMORAN: first 
of four for naval duties 
Four new ASD lugs ordered by US 
operator Moran Towing arc now in 
service at two Military Sealift Command 
bases in ihe Norfolk, Virginia area. The 
prestigious design and build contract whs 
won by Wasliburn & Doughty of Hast 
Boothbay in Maine, respected commercial 
vessel builders thai had surprisingly little 
experience in the lug sector. 
The key to success in winning the order 
undoubtedly lies with the delivery of Fort 
Bragg, a 27.84m x 9.75m Z-drive reverse 
tractor designed by Bnice Washburn and 
built a! his yard in 1998. This in turn was 
inspired by a twin-screw tug design of 1991 
but. aside from this, theWashburn portfolio 
had little else to help ihwari intense 
competition from other builders. 
The lead vessel for Moran - Murci 
Moron -
measures 28,04m x 9.75m and 
has a draft of 4,2m. Power is provided by 
a pair of EMD-645-E2 diesels. each 
developing 2,100hp at 900 rev/min. These 
drive stem-mounted Ulstein type I350H 
Z-drives with stainless steel propellers 
turning inside stainless lined Kort nozzles. 
Twin Detroit 4-71 gensets with a total 
output of lOOkW supply auxiliary power. 
A third Detroit dicsel engine - an 8V7! T -
rated 280fep al 1,800 rev/min is included 
in the package lo turn an Aurora fire pump. 
which has a discharge rale of 3.000 US 
galls/min. This feeds two Skum fire-
fighting monitors located in the Forward 
starboard and all port quarters of the bridge 
deck. 
The compact wheelhouse, accessed 
internally to port and externally on ihe 
inside of (he starboard exhaust stack, has 
parallel consoles forward either side of the 
helmsman's seat. The chunky rectangular 
exhausl stacks scarcely obstruct good all-
round views and 
all 
navigational 
equipment - including Furuno GPS. depth 
sounder and radar -
are embedded in the 
control consoles. 
Crew accommodation is arranged in 
the deckhouse with two crew cabins, 
each with double bunk beds forward of 
the engine room and a shared cabin for 
captain and mate lo port. A roomy 
combined galley, dinette and lounge 
section takes up most of the starboard 
side. The dining area features a U-
shapeil seating arrangement, which is 
sufficient to seat all crew members, and 
continuous sealing along ihe forward and 
side bulkheads for up lo ten extra people. 
This additional space will be used when 
vessel crews are beina ferried.

MARK 10 LCU: prototypes 
in test for 2000 
Two 
prototype vessels of Mark 10 LCU 
(landing craft 
utility) 
type are 
undergoing extensive operational trials 
during 2000 with the UK Royal Navy. The 
duo Form pan of a ,€35 million ten-vessel 
design and build contract placed with the 
Land & Sea Systems Division of British 
Aerospace and are being built under sub 
contract at Ailsa-Troon Shipyard on the 
Scottish west coast. 
The vessels form the initial stage of the 
Navy's programme to improve ils 
amphibious capability and are the flrsl to 
have 
a 
ro-ro 
facility 
with 
electrohydraulically operated bow and 
stem ramps. The forward ramp is wide 
enough to take a Challenger tank whilst 
aft access, restricted by the offset 
wheelhouse, can accept most normal 
vehicles. Both ramps were supplied by 
Transmarine. 
Wiili a displacement of 240 tonnes. Ihe 
LCUs measure 29.8m overall with a beam 
of 7.4ra and a draft Of 1.5m. Two 
completely self-contained engine rooms 
each house a 400kW MAN D2840LE 
diesel and one of two differently sized 
Cnmiiiiiis/Newage generator sets. This 
arrangement ensures that the craft are still 
operational in the event of a single engine 
room sustaining damage. The larger 
generator is an air-cooled set bavin" an 
output of lOOfcW and the other, a waler-
cuolcd unit used for normal cruising, is of 
50kW. Selected in order to provide trouble-
free Operation when the craft is beached, 
the air-cooled arrangement provides power 
to three hydraulic power packs for the ramp 
and kedge winches, pins supplying a bow 
thrusler and under deck tract healing. 
Both main engines drive a model SPJ82 
PumpJet mounted at the stern. A similar, 
but smaller, electrically driven SPJ15RD 
PumpJei is lilted at the bow. The units are 
Hush mounted to prevent damage when 
grounding. 
Jigger winches raise and lower the bow 
and stern ramps, each of which has an 
independent electrohydraulic power pack. 
The third pack is dedicated to Ihe kedge 
winch but interconnection is possible in 
an emergency. 
Designed to operate from the new 
landing platform dock vessels, HMS 
Bulwark and HMS Albion, currently under 
construction al the Marconi Marine yard 
in Barrow-in-Furness, the LCUs arc 
capable of operating in a combat situation 
worldwide. Each can carry 120 fully 
equipped troops (willi skis and two over-
snow vehicles), four high-sided vehicles 
or a main bailie lank. The first Iwo vessels 
were built to schedule within 14 months 
and were handed over simultaneously.

MIDNIGHT ARROW: Multi-role 
OSV starts work in Mexican Gulf 
The 60m long survey/ROV/offshore 
support vessel Midnight Arrow lias 
recently begun a long term charter in the 
Gulf of Mexico with Torch, Inc. The vessel 
was built by the revitalised Balenciaga yard 
to a Cintnmava! design for Dublin-based 
Adams Vessels (Bilbao) Ltd, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Khalifa A Algosaibi 
Diving & Marine Services of Saudi Arabia. 
As towing is not a prerequisite, power 
is comparatively low for an OSV ol'60.00] n 
x 13.30m \ 3.80m. Two Caterpillar 
35I2TA diesels, each developing !.297hp 
at 1,800 rev/rain, are installed under the 
centre of the deck abaft the moonpool. 
These turn stern-mounted Schottel twin 
propeller units, type STP 1010. through 
flexible couplings and inclined shafts. By 
using these "dual-prop" units, it has been 
possible to minimise the diameter and 
hence, the operating draft At the bow. two 
35OkW Schottel type 5TT 170 transverse 
thrusters are fitted. 
To meet the vessel's high eleetrieal 
demand, four Caterpillar driven generator 
sets are located in a separate auxiliary room 
adjacent 
to 
the 
main switchboard 
compart men 
t. 
Three, arranged 
for 
synchronous operation, are 425kW, 3412 
units whilst a fourth, solely dedicated to 
ROV operations, is p 34O8TA producing 
37OkW. A f)4k\V emergency set is located 
on the forecastle deck. 
Diving support, pipeline construction 
and maintenance are llie vessel's primary 
tasks and. as much manpower is needed 
to perform these operations, the vessel has 
accommodation for 52 persons. Most of the 
quarters are on the main deck and are 
notable for their spaciousness. On the 
upper deck arc two four-berth cabins, 
separate ROV and project offices, 
comfortable day room, mess and galley. 
The mess has sealing for 42 at seven tables 
and is equipped with a coffee machine. 
Forward of the galley are extensive dry arid 
cold stores. The captain and chief engineer 
each have extensive 'suites' at the forward 
end of the forecastle deck, together with 
other officer cabins, guest accommodation 
and the ship's office. 
With dimensions of 14m x 8m, the 
wheelhouse is large by any standards. 
Walk-round consoles fore and all duplicate 
most controls (Schottel) and commun 
ication systems (Sailor) whilst the unit 
facing ahead is flanked by two Furuno 
radars. Jusi all of the port wheelhouse door 
is the Furuno Inmarsat B equipment, 
alongside a battery of fax machines. A 
Sailor 'compact' GMDSS system backs 
onto a large char! table. Other electronic 
items include a Fiiruno echosounder and a 
Raytheon GPS. 
A prominent feature on the starboard 
aft quarter is the dual screen Naulronix 
DPS2 dynamic positioning system which 
can accept DGPS, hydro-acoustic and taut 
wire references. According to Balenciaga. 
this is the first Spanish built vessel of this 
type to be DP equipped and on trials, in 
30-knol winds and 3m seas, the ship was 
able to maintain station to within 400mm. 
A eompanionway at the aft end of the 
wheelhouse leads lo the roof and on up to 
the helicopter deck. This is an aluminium 
structure supported on sled uprights and 
is prolecled by Iwo fire-fiyhling monitors 
mounted on a platform high on the mast. 
Dominating the fimber clad aft deck, 
which has an area of 310nr, is a Norlifl 
crane with a 45 ton SWL a! 10m outreach. 
Unusually, this is located near to the 
transom, which has a wide gale. Other deck 
machinery items include a pair of 
Ridderinkhoff capstans and a forward 
windlass. A Zodiac rieid inflatable.

in under 15 months from the signing of 
ilic contract and to the entire satisfaction 
of the customer, who may order a second 
vessel. 
Now under a new management team, 
Balenciaga has, over the last three years, 
entered a period of greatly improved 
profitability with the result thai mi 
extensive inveslmen! programme is in 
progress. Already a large dedicated pipe 
shop lias been constructed and a new NC 
bending machine installed, This has 
facilitated work on 2.000m of pipe 
installed on Midnight Arrow. Two more 
workshops i52m x I Km and 70m \ 15m) 
are to be added before mid-2000. 
together with n total of 215m of deep 
water quay. This hitler facility will result 
from a dredging exercise - the final stage 
in a marsh/mud reclamation project 
along two sides of the original yard 
perimeter.

NEELTJE P\ first in 
Towmaster series 
The twin screw lug Nei'ltje P has 
become ihe first of a new class of 
vessel designated 'Towmasiei' due lo 
its patented rudder system. Designed 
in the UK by Burness. Corlett & 
Partners (BCP). ihe tug - along with 
two subsequent identical sisters -
was 
built in Santiago at Astillcro.s Detroit 
Chile I'or Terminates Maracaibo in 
Venezuela. 
Neeltje P measures 30.40m x 10.0m 
with a draft aft of 4.0m and has a hull 
based upon BCP's much proven and 
easy to build double chine form. It has 
a transom slern and well-rounded bow 
with a half-height forecastle to provide 
freeboard ai the bow as well as space 
below for crew accommodation. Due 
lo low profile exhausts, positioned well 
aft, the wheelhouse has exceptionally 
good visibility for manoeuvring and 
safely controlling deck machinery. 
The vessel is powered by a pair of 
Detroit Diesel I2V-4000 engines, 
developing a 
total 
of 3,384k\V 
(4,60()hp) at 2,100 rev/min, driving 
2,600mm diameter propellers with 
fixed nozzles. Bollard pulls in exeess 
of 60 tonnes ahead anil 41 tonnes astern 
were achieved on trials, together with 
a 13.6-knol maximum speed. Two 
Detroil Dicsel/Maraihon generator sets, 
each of 56kW. supply the eleclrical 
power and a 500hp Detroit Diesel 8V71 
drives an 800m 7h fire pump. 
As well as providing detailed design 
plans for the lug. BCP designed the 
Towmaster system. For Neeltje P. Ihe 
most recently developed version of 
triple high lift rudder system was fitted 
to both Kurt nozzles. This arrangement 
provides almost pure side thrust when 
the rudders reach their maximum 
design helm angle. A Kobelt steering 
system gives hoth combined and 
independent control. 
A single, a double and two triple 
berlh cabins are situated forward of ihe 
engine mom whilst ihe captain's cabin 
is on the forecastle deck alongside a 
spacious mess and separate galley. The 
wheelhouse has a T-shaped floor plan 
with a centrally located helm seat. A 
chart table is to port and a Furuno

PACIFIC SUPPLIER: Ulstein design 
modified for extra flexibility 
Tywijic Supplier, the first of a series of 
JL 
four .<i8.03ni x 15.00m sister ships, 
joined the fleet of Singapore operator Swire 
Pacific Offshore in early '99, Based upon 
an Ulsiein UT 719 design hul modified in 
accordance with the owner's instructions 
by the Japanese builder Imamura Shipyard, 
the vessel lias greater capacity and 
flexibility for cargo carrying than standard 
UT 719 ships. 
Traditional in terms of offshore layout, 
with Forward superstructure, large aft deck 
and forecastle. Pacific Supplier has a top 
speed of 14 knots, service speed of 10 knots 
(burning an economic seven tonnes of fuel 
per day) and a bollard pull of 68 tonnes. 
Propulsion is by means of twin Ulsiein 
Bergen KRMB-9 main diesels, each 
developing 2.0()5kW at 825 rcv/min, 
driving CP propellers in Kort mizzles. A 
trio of 7,O00hp Ulsiein I50TVelectrically-
driven timnei thrusters are fitted, two at 
the how and one at the stern. Enhanced 
manoeuvrability 
is 
ensured 
by 
incorporation of an Ulsiein Poscon joystick, 
which is integrated to the propellers, 
engines, rudders and side thruslers and 
interfaced to the Tokimec gyrocompass and 
Simrad Robertson AP9 Mk3 autopilot. 
Tanks for mud. brine and eemenl have 
been arranged, along with fuel oil. potable 
water, ballast and lube oil tanks, to allow 
a variety of products to be carried. All are 
centrally control ted by a tanklender system 
to meet specific customer needs. The tanks 
for liquid mud, for example, have sloping 
bottoms and are free of internal stiffening 
to optimise cargo out-turn and assist 
cleaning. 
A prominent feature of the aft deck is a 
totally enclosed winch house containing a 
remotely controlled Ulsiein Braltvaag SL 
150-B2T low pressure hydraulic winch, 
which has a brake holding load of 250 
tonnes and a capacity of 1.400m of 56mm

REDBUS 
folds for 
A 
uniquely constructed foldable 
catamaran style workboat frora newly 
formed company Redbus Workboats can 
be adapted for a huge range of work and 
leisure activities. Designated Redbus 520, 
the craft can he launched and recovered 
from a dedicated trailer in a matter of 
minutes making it idea! for fast response 
situations .such as fire-fighting and 
pollution control. 
Key to the innovative design is a 
patented system for locking the two GRP 
multi-section hulls to the bridge deck and. 
hence, unfolding the boat for operation. On 
recovery, the hulls are easily detached and 
folded so that the boat can be lowed away. 
Measuring 5,2ra x 3.5m, the vessel is 
claimed to be highly stable in open sea and 
sheltered waters and offers more than 13m3 
of useable deck space, equivalent to that 
of many larger workboats of 9m or more, 
'fhe central bridge deck is made from steel 
with a marine-ply 'non-slip' surface 
through which equipment may be secured. 
II'required, the deck can be trap-doored to 
permit through-deck winching of up to 1.6 
tonnes and can be easily adapted to 
incorporate securing points Cor onboard 
equipment. 
Redbus 520 is recognised by the Marine 
& Coastguard Agency (MCA) as meeting 
the requirements of the Code of Practice 
520: Cat style craft 
road transport 
for Small Workboats & Pilot Boats for 
payloads of up to 1.6 tonnes. This 
represents a major advantage when 
compared to many RIBs and other vessels. 
Also of advantage are the different power 
and propulsion options of diesel or petrol 
engines. Redbu.s Workhoals will supply 
and lit engines of customer choice, together 
with steering gear and console. As a guide, 
a loiir-stroke engine should ensure a speed 
of 20 knots for an unladen craft. The power 
range spans 27-l20hp depending upon 
application. 
Other bonuses are good manoeuvrability 
and shallow draft, which makes the 
Rcdbus 520 ideal for operations within the 
confines of harbours and marinas. Draft 
can be as little as 30cm, allowing activities 
such as structural surveys and repairs to 
be conducted with ease. 
Commenting on the launch of the craft. 
Keith Lewis, managing director of Redbus 
Workhoats, said: "The stability, strength 
and loading capacity of the Redbus 520 
creates unique opportunities within many 
marine sectors, where for many years 
conventional boats have provided only 
limited capability. The Redbus 520's 
ability to be stored and transported on land 
gives an added dimension to the boat's 
flexibility. The Redbus 520 brings together 
the very best of British innovation with the 
finest in British engineering." 
To dale, as evidence of its versatility, 
the 520 lias 
been marketed most 
specifically to harbours, fire-fighters and 
pollution control experts. Loading pollution 
and environmental control company. 
Vikoma International, has purchased the 
vessel as part of its integrated, rapid 
response capability and UK lire crews have 
recognised the value of die craft's shallow 
draft. Utilising the easy-access ramp has 
enabled llremen to easily launch modern 
roll-on roll-off lire-fighting equipment

RIVAGE ST MARTIN: 
first of new style 'boutique' cruisers 
Australian shipbuilder. Austal Ships, 
joutends thai there is a growing need 
Ibr a product that sits between the Full-size 
cruise ship and the luxury charter yacht, 
offering a high level erf exclusivity but ai a 
price approaching that of the traditional 
cruising vessel. The yard has named this 
the 'boutique' cruise market and believes 
the concept works best with up to around 
100 passengers, 
Rivage Si Martin, at 60m x 15m, is the 
first example built specifically for ibis new 
market and is currently cruising in the 
Caribbean. An abundance of luxurious 
Features have been incorporated to cater 
to the comfort and relaxation of 80 
passengers. 
The vessel 
is 
an all-aluminium 
catamaran with semi-SWATH bulls which, 
combined with the ship's wide beam, 
provides excellent stability and a seakindly 
motion. A maximum draft of 2.1m is 
particularly suitable for a vessel that needs 
to moor close inshore in natural scenic 
lagoons rather than at busy ports or out at 
sea. 
A service speed of 14.5 knots is derived 
from a twin MTU 12V 2000 M70 diesel 
arrangement, each unit developing 79OkW 
at 2,100 iev/min, turning fixed pilch 
propellers through ZF BW 256 gearboxes. 
This speed will enable the vessel to arrive 
at a different destination each morning 
after only three hours sailing during the 
night The operator, Rivages Crossieres, 
the Caribbean arm of leading French 
maritime group. Compagnie Chambon, 
intends to run the vessel on a seven-day 
cycle, the final day being the changeover 
at home port Si Martin. 
The luxury one-class vessel features a 
very high standard of interior finish with 
34 fully carpeted cabins on three decks -
each with an exterior view. Single beds in 
the 16 tWO-berth cabins can be linked to 
create double berths whilst four cabins are 
capable of accepting two extra persons and 
four more have a single additional berth. 
All have private en-suite facilities. 
controllable eir conditioning, safety deposit 
box and TV monitors connected to the 
ship's video system. 
Central reception is situated on the main 
deck, along with a souvenir shop and 80-
seai restaurant. The gourmet galley 
provides a wide range of French cuisine. 
A bar and lounge on the upper deck (again 
will] scaling for 80) adjoins a dance floor 
with disc-jockey station. There are also 
smaller bars by the saltwater swimming 
pool and on (he sun deck. 
For those guesls seeking more action 
than lounging and drinking, a walersports 
boat is localed on the upper deck and slem 
platforms ease ihe use of a witle range of 
equipment including water skis, snorkel 
sels. sailboards and sea kayaks. Three large 
rigid inflatable tetulers arc also provided 
for swift transfer to and from ibc shore. 
Rivage Si Martin operates with a crew 
of 20 (eight officers and ratings plus 12 
hotel and catering staff). The captain and 
chief engineer have accommodation abaft 
the bridge whilst the remaining crew 
quarters are lo be found in the forward

RIVER RUNNER: Rotterdam 
takes six for ferry service 
Officially launched on Is1 November 
'99, the 'Nieuwc wegen over water' 
project has entered into its Bret phase of 
developing a low-wash mass transit ferry 
service in The Netherlands. 
Promoting waterbua transport as an 
efficient alternative to the use of congested 
road and rail networks, the service utilises 
four River Runner 150 ferries built in 
Holland by Damen Shipyards under a 
licence agreement with designers and 
builders NQEA Df Australia. The kilter 
also received a contract to build two of the 
larger Type 200 vessels in Australia for 
the same project. 
With a view to making Rotterdam more 
accessible by water, two companies were 
formed to operate ferry services -
High 
Speed Ferries BV and Walerbus BV. 
Waterbus BV represcnls a joint venture 
between ZWN and Stadsvervoer and will 
provide a link with (he Drcchloever towns 
of 
Dordrecht, 
Papendrecht 
and 
Zwijndrechl every 15 minutes with a 
connection between Dordrecht. Sliedreehl. 
Mendrick Ido Ambachl and Albasserdam 
every 30 minutes. All towns involved have 
been provided with a purpose-built covered 
floating berth, located adjacent to car 
parking and bus interchange. Self-service 
lickcling is provided on Ihree floating 
berths.
