T
he first three of a series of new Z-Tech 6000 
class ship-handling tugs, Bocas Del Toro, reported 
for duty with the Panama Canal Authority in late 
January 2007, with the second and third following 
in February. Designed by Robert Allan Ltd, of 
Vancouver, Canada, these new high-performance 
tugs are based on the standard successful Z-Tech 
6000 class design, but were specifically adapted to 
the operational needs of ACP for the busiest ship 
channel in the world. 
A total fleet of eight new tugs is being built by Cheoy 
Lee Shipyards Ltd, of Hong Kong, at its Hin Lee 
Shipyard facility in China.
The Z-Tech design combines the performance 
features of an azimuthing stern drive (ASD) tug with 
those of a Z-drive tractor tug. The Z-Tech has a large 
skeg forward, providing a high indirect steering force, 
and enabling directionally stable operation in both 
ahead and the astern tractor modes. 
The working deck forward is relatively low and 
flat, creating a safer working space, yet still leaving 
sufficient room to install/withdraw the Z-drive units 
from aft of the house. For seagoing operations or for 
line towing, the Z-Tech with its high, rounded stern 
works stern-first in tractor mode. A single control 
station serves both harbour ship-handling duties 
(facing forward over the working deck), and transiting 
or towing voyages (facing astern).
Although after their delivery voyages the new ACP Z-
Techs are operating in the relatively benign conditions 
of the canal, their maiden voyages involved a complete 
transit of the open Pacific, from China to Panama, 
under their own power. 
The delivery voyages were undertaken by crews 
from Redwise, in The Netherlands, who experienced 
the full brunt of a series of the same Pacific storms 
that battered the west coast of North America in 
December. The tugs reportedly came through this 
ordeal successfully.
The ACP Z-Tech 6000 includes a number of unique 
features, specifically suited to the operations in the 
Panama Canal. These include a wider beam (11.65m) 
in order to ensure a higher clearance angle (minimum 
35deg) when working under the flare of ships. In 
addition, the height of the wheelhouse is lower than 
other tugs of this class, again to ensure better tug-
ship clearance.
The propulsion plant comprises a pair of Wärtsilä 
9L20 engines, each rated 1800kW at 1000rev/min, 
driving Lips model LCT FS250-S/BN-K Z-Drives 
with 2400mm diameter FP propellers. 
Firefighting capability is provided by a single FFS 
Model SFP 250X350HD fire pump with a capacity 
of 1136m3/hour, driven by an independent diesel 
engine.
Two independent winches have been equipped 
forward, which reflects the operational process 
within the canal, where tugs put up two lines to 
the stern of an attended ship (thus creating a short 
bridle) when running through the various restricted 
areas of the canal. The skeg of the tug then acts as 
an extended rudder to the attended ship, providing 
much enhanced manoeuvrability at slow speeds.
A ‘day boat’ accommodation arrangement has 
been included, again suited to the nature of the 
canal operations. A feature of this configuration is a 
complete ‘breezeway’ across the deckhouse, isolating 
the exhaust casing/engineroom entry from the crew 
accommodation spaces. This provides much better 
noise control in the latter.

T
he Netherlands-based builder Shipyard De Hoop 
Lobith delivered yard number 422, Bourbon Trieste, 
on 27 September 2007, after a successful launch in 
June. The 85m multi-purpose ROV and offshore 
intervention service vessel then set sail for her first 
job in Egypt for Sonsub. 
The vessel was named Bourbon Trieste in honour of 
the famous bathyscaphe that holds the world record 
for deepest dive.
Sonsub entered into a long term charter with 
Bourbon Offshore Greenmar Management, the 
owner of the ship, for the provision of a newbuild 
vessel to be dedicated to deepwater work in West 
Africa. Bourbon Offshore Greenmar provides marine 
services, operating in the international offshore oilfield 
market, and its two main activities are crew and vessel 
management.
The vessel has a length overall of 85.25m, a length 
waterline of 81.70m, a beam of 18m, a depth of 7.4m, 
and a draught of 5.75m. A large working deck area of 
800m2 has been provided, along with a mezzanine deck 
area of 260m2. Cabins for 70 have been provided, with 
all the expected modern facilities. 
Classified by French society Bureau Veritas, Bourbon 
Trieste has a DP Class 2 diesel-electric propulsion 
system and has been designed with special features 
for deepwater intervention. With this in mind, a 100m 
offshore subsea crane with AHC knuckle boom at 
7m/10m up to 2000m water depth, and a 12tonne 
knuckle boom crane certified for man-riding, both 
with fast deepwater deployment capabilities, have 
been fitted. 
Based on specific job requirements, Sonsub will 
install one or two Innovator heavy work class ROV 
systems with full 3000m water depth operating 
capacity. The spread will be dedicated mainly to light 
subsea construction and IRM activities in deepwater.
Bourbon Trieste has been fitted with four main engines, 
with an output of 7638bhp, and two FP azimuthing 
propellers with an output of 1800kW. In addition, two 
CP tunnel thrusters with an output of 780kW and one 
FP retractable azimuthing thruster have also been 
fitted, and the vessel can reach speeds of 12knots, and 
has a bollard pull of 50tonnes.

I
n November 2005, KST BV (formerly trading 
under the name Kooren Shipbuilding and Trading) 
ordered four new RT-80r class Rotor tugs to be built 
at ASL Shipyard Pte Ltd, in Singapore. Delivery of 
the tugs began in December 2007 and the units will 
continue to be delivered at regular intervals until 
March 2008. 
The vessels, the first three of which are named Bugsier 
6, Bugsier 4, and Bugsier 5, are modern high performance 
tugs specifically designed for harbour and coastal 
berthing operations, as well as coastal towing. 
The tugs have a bollard pull capacity in excess 
of 80tonnes each and this high bollard pull, good 
manoeuvring capabilities, and comparable low draught, 
have reportedly proved extremely popular amongst 
purchasers. 
They have a length overall of 28.30m, a length 
waterline of 26.10m, a beam of 12m, and a depth of 
5.24m. Classified by Germanischer Lloyd to: Hull + 
100 A5 M (TUG) Machinery + MC AUT FF1, the 
sisters have a displacement of 456tonnes.
Each tug will be powered by three Wärtsilä 8L20C 
main engines of 1600kW, each of 1000rev/min.  Speeds 
of 12knots can be reached, and the tugs have an 
impressive range of 4000nm.  
The three Wärtsilä/Lips azimuth thrusters that are 
fitted to the tugs are of the 225-S/WN-K 2300mm 
type with CP fitted in HR nozzles. Additionally, a 
LipsTronic remote control system and an integrated 
bridge control system, as well as an advanced engine 
monitoring system have been fitted for better navigation 
and control capabilities.
As is to be expected, a great deal of deck machinery 
has been fitted to the vessels, including: a Plimsoll 
combined anchor/towing winch; two pool high holding 
power anchors; and a 9tonne-10tonne (25tonne option) 
hydraulic crane.
For towing, a heavy duty hydraulic towing winch 
has been fitted aft and forward. These winches have 
a capacity of 30tonnes 0-15m/min pull on the first 
layer and a brake force of 200tonnes. The tow line has 
a minimum length of 200m, the hawser 10m, and the 
forerunner 20m.
For firefighting, the tugs have been equipped 
with standard Fi-Fi 2400m3 equipment, two 1200m3 
monitors, a foam injection unit, and a 300m3/hour 
spray system. Lifesaving devices include eight lifebuoys, 
two eight-person liferafts, and a Zodiac six-person 
MOB boat with launching device.

A
n oil recovery and salvage vessel for Spain’s 
Maritime Safety Authority (SASEMAR), was this 
year built by Spanish shipyard Astilleros Zamakona. 
This vessel was commissioned in the wake of the 
Prestige disaster to combat potential environmental 
threats.  Don Inda is now working in Galicia, Spain.
Don Inda (and identical sister Clara Campoamor, which 
was delivered in March 2007) has been built with 
emergency towing as the main role. Should the worst 
happen with a tanker, she is equipped with a full range 
of equipment for recovering spilt oil. Rolls-Royce 
developed the design for these vessels and provided the 
main equipment. They are of the UT-Design type UT 
722 L because they are derived from the anchor handler 
of the same type number, although they differ from an 
offshore AHTS in many respects. 
Both vessels have a length overall of 80.60m, a length 
bp of 70.10m, and a draught of up to 6.8m. Hull depth 
to main deck, however, is considerably larger than the 
normal UT 722 L at 8.25m.  
The SASEMAR vessels lie at the towing end of the 
spectrum, having a large installed power and very 
powerful towing winches. They are, however, flexible 
enough to take on many other roles, including pollution 
clean-up, escort towing, rescue of ships and their crews, 
emergency coordination, firefighting, and salvage.
A primary role is the emergency towing of tankers of 
unlimited size under adverse conditions. The bollard 
pull of about 220tonnes makes these vessels the most 
powerful coastguard vessels in Europe, with regard 
to towing.
An important feature is the extremely large tank 
capacity for recovered oil of approximately 1730m3. 
This figure can be increased as an oil/water separation 
system is built-in. The recovered oil tanks will 
be filled with about 95% oil and 5% water, the 
separator discharging water of a cleanliness meeting 
environmental regulations back to the sea, whereas 
normally oil recovery tanks would contain a mixture of 
about 50/50 oil and water. 
As the recovered oil may have a high viscosity, all 
these tanks are heated, enabling oil to subsequently 
be pumped to another vessel or ashore. This feature 
means that the SASEMAR vessels can act as pumping 
stations in the event of a massive oil spill. 
Four Bergen eight cylinder B32:40 long stroke engines 
produce a total of 16,000kW. Two engines are coupled 
to each propeller shaft turning a CP propeller, and a 
fire pump is geared to the forward end of the inner 
engine of each pair. This propulsion system provides a 
maximum speed of 17.6knots. 
Depending on the operating mode, either all four 
engines can be run, or just one on each shaft line. In 
addition, there are powerful auxiliary generator sets, 
and the swing-up azimuth bow thruster has its own 
independent 736kW diesel engine. 
Manoeuvring is enhanced by high lift rudders, twin 
stern tunnel thrusters, and an additional bow tunnel 
thruster supplementing the azimuth unit. The vessels 
are built to Bureau Veritas class and have dynamic 
positioning notation AM/ATR, which corresponds to 
IMO DP2 standard.
The towing winch on Don Inda is designed to use the 
full bollard pull capability. This main winch is a two 
drum hydraulic Rauma Brattvaag unit sized for 83mm 
wire and capable of pulling 300tonnes with a 550tonne 
brake holding load. For escort work there is a winch on 
the foredeck with a 45tonne pull/250tonne brake load 
equipped with synthetic rope towlines. 
A strongly fendered reinforced bow allows the 
SASEMAR vessels to push disabled ships. Deck layout 
aft is designed to give a clear lead for towlines, but the 
vessels will be prepared for an A-frame at the stern 
which can be put aboard when required, for example to 
undertake salvage of sunken vessels.
A comprehensive range of oil booms and skimming 
equipment enable Don Inda to clear oil pollution, both 
on the open sea and in more confined waters. There are 
two oil booms, one with a 100mm freeboard, the other 
600mm freeboard, to enclose oil spills under different 
sea conditions. Oil can be transferred from the booms 
by a Transrec 150 system to the recovered oil tanks. 
For more confined waters, two 15m long floating 
arms can be deployed from the ship’s side in a wide vee-
shape. The vessel moves through the oil spill, sweeping 
oil towards the recovery pumps. Two small craft are 
carried – a MOB/boarding boat and a 9m craft with a 
bollard pull of 2tonnes, mainly intended to tow the oil 
booms. An oil dispersant system is also to be installed. 
Don Inda is equipped to Fi-FiII firefighting standard 
with three main water/foam monitors, plus a self-
drenching system.

D
esigned by consultants Skipsteknisk and built 
by Astilleros Gondan, Edda Fram is claimed to 
be the first PSV with diesel electric Voith Schneider 
propulsion and the first with integrated drill cutting 
handling systems. Built for Norwegian owner 
Østensjø Rederi, a sister ship is also set for delivery 
in 2009.
The ship, model ST 216, has an overall length of 
85.80m, a length bp of 19.20m, a draught of 6.50m, 
and a depth of 8.0m.  The craft will have a special low 
resistance hull form which has had extensive model 
testing at Marintek, Trondheim, and the Vienna Model 
Basin. Both PSVs are classed by Det Norske Veritas.
The Voith Schneider propulsion ensures improved 
efficiency with an active roll reduction function 
(ARRF). Two 1500kW super silent bow thrusters, and 
a new RIM thruster 800kW have also been fitted. Voith 
has also supplied the two 2800kW propellers. The 
vessels will be able to reach speeds of 15knots.
The suitability of the Voith Schneider propulsion for 
offshore vessels has been demonstrated, and it has been 
discovered that the high propulsion efficiency has 5%-
20% (depending on operational conditions and speed) 
potential fuel savings compared with contra rotating 
azimuth thrusters. 
The Voith Schneider propulsion unit has a very quick 
thrust response time from port to starboard, with a 
maximum of about two seconds. This feature allows 
the thruster forces actively to counteract for the roll 
movement of the vessel. The roll of the vessel will in 
many cases be reduced by up to 90%.
The diesel-electric system is based on 690V of Aker 
Kværner’s new Low Loss Concept (LLC) which has 
been specially designed for this vessel. The LLC 
principally consist of four switchboards instead of the 
normal two connected via a bus-tie breaker, a bus-link, 
and two LLC transformers into a ring system.
The LLC provides for an increased power and 
thruster availability in case of any failure on the 
switchboard, especially in DP mode. In case of a short 
circuit failure on one of the switchboards, the available 
power will be reduced, and the available thruster 
capacity by 25%. A traditional system with a split 
switchboard will similarly have a reduction of 50% of 
both available power and thruster capacity.
Østensjø Rederi AS launched a development project 
aiming to radically improve on the safety, capacity, 
and costs involved in transportation and handling of 
drill cutting. This project was initially initiated as a 
cooperation project with Shell UK.
A total of eight circular tanks are arranged and 
connected to different systems with chemical type 
separation flanges. The tanks may be used for a variety 
of cargoes and slops including low flash point liquids. 
Tank suctions and pumps are placed underneath the 
tanks, allowing for the best possible suction and 
draining of the tanks.
The drill cutting system is integrated into the large 
tank capacity area – around 400m3 – below the deck. 
This new unit is also newly developed and assists the 
handling and pumping of high density drill cutting.   
The accommodation onboard is high quality and 
includes single cabins with TV and entertaining 
equipment; a satellite TV antenna; a spacious lounge 
and mess room; a separate lounge for smokers; a 
gymnasium/recreation room with a sauna; and office 
facilities.

A
bu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) has now 
received four twin screw azimuth stern drive 
(ASD) type, mooring work, and oil recovery boats 
from Dubai-based shipbuilding and repair specialist 
Grandweld, part of the GMMOS group, in a deal 
worth US$15.1 million. The deal was signed in 
August 2006. 
The craft have been specifically designed for 
ADNOC to be operated by Abu Dhabi Petroleum 
Ports Operating Co (IRSHAD) at the Single Buoy 
Mooring (SBM) terminals of Abu Dhabi Petroleum 
Ports. The vessels were designed to comply with the 
requirements of Abu Dhabi Petroleum Ports Authority, 
with significant seakeeping performance in order to 
reduce the port closure time due to inclement weather, 
and to include oil recovery and firefighting systems.
These tugs have been designed with a high beam to 
length ratio and increased stability with the utilisation 
of an aluminium wheelhouse. The vessels have 
additionally been installed with a forward hydraulic 
towing winch, heavy duty towing staple, and an 
autopilot with ahead and astern operation.
It took Grandweld less than 14 months to complete 
construction and handover of the first two boats. A 
third vessel was delivered to ADNOC in November 
2007, with the last scheduled for delivery before the 
end of 2007. Grandweld’s newbuild division constructs 
steel and aluminium vessels such as tugs, anchor 
handling vessels, supply vessels, and crew boats. 
The vessels, Elyah and Assad have a length of 20m, 
with a beam of 8m, and depth of 3.5m. The craft are 
classified by Lloyd’s Register of Shipping with notation: 
+ LMC A1 SSC, Work Boat, Mono, Occasional Oil 
Recovery Duties, G3 Mooring, + LMC, UMS.
Each boat is powered by twin MTU engines rated at 
880kW each, and has a bollard pull of 30tonnes. The 
tugs are capable of reaching a top speed of 11.2knots. 
Two nozzled Schottel SRP 550 FP propellers with a 
speed of 360rev/min assist propulsion. Two Leroy 
Somer alternators with an output of 1800rev/min have 
also been fitted. 
Accomodation has been provided for four crew 
members in one cabin.

T
he latest vessel to come from the close collaboration 
between Farstad Shipping and Rolls-Royce is Far 
Sapphire, a powerful vessel for anchor handling, ROV 
operations, and subsea work in ultra-deep water. Far 
Sapphire was built by Aker Yards Langsten, in Norway, 
with hull steelwork fabricated at Aker Yards Braila, in 
Romania. 
Far Sapphire is a UT 732 CD, one of a range of new 
generation of offshore vessel designs from Rolls-Royce 
that incorporate the company’s latest thinking in low- 
resistance hull forms, efficient propulsion, safe and 
effective handling of heavy anchors and moorings in 
ultra-deep waters, lighter subsea construction work, and 
ROV operation.
The CD in the type name indicates that the vessel, 
including diesel engines, meets the clean design 
classification society requirements for minimum 
emissions to the air and low risk of water pollution. In 
addition, Far Sapphire has Comf-V3 notation, indicating 
a comfortable low noise and vibration environment for 
those onboard. There is accommodation for up to 60 
people, in 35 cabins, which includes spacious operational 
rooms and several dayrooms for crew, including three 
lounges, a conference room, offices, and an ROV 
control room.
With its full outfit of Rolls-Royce equipment and 
systems, this 92m long, 22m beam vessel has some 
impressive capabilities to offer to the offshore oil and 
gas industry. Its main hydraulic winch has three drums 
covering different tasks. 
The special handling drum can pull 500tonnes and 
hold more than 12km of 76mm steel wire rope, or 
1600m of large diameter synthetic fibre rope. The two 
anchor handling/towing drums have pulls of 450tonnes 
and 350tonnes, while both can hold 675tonnes on the 
brake and have a large wire capacity. 
The main winch is complemented by secondary 
winches and deck equipment for safe handling of 
wires and chains. An ROV hangar is incorporated in 
the superstructure, and all the normal supplies can be 
carried, up to a maximum deadweight of 4582.7tonnes.
Farstad Shipping has invested heavily in measures 
to reduce emissions and water pollution risks from Far 
Sapphire. The double hull means that there is no fuel 
or potentially polluting cargo next to the outer skin. 
A hybrid propulsion system reduces the amount of 
fuel burnt by matching the way in which the engines 
and propulsion equipment are used to the task being 
undertaken, for example in transit, full power anchor 
handling, or lying at a rig in dynamic positioning mode. 
Four Bergen clean design main engines can produce 
a total of 16,000kW to give a bollard pull of 232tonnes 
using the main CP propellers or 261tonnes if the Azimuth 
thrusters are coupled in as well. Various combinations of 
diesel mechanical and diesel electric can be selected to 
suit the operation. 
The engines meet clean design rules, and Farstad 
calculates that fuel consumption and, consequently, 
emissions will be reduced by up to 50% compared with 
a typical conventional AHTS, and NOx reduced by 95% 
altogether due to the engine design and the catalytic 
converter system specified.

T
he first of 10 new diesel-electric Rigdon GPA-
654 platform support vessels went into service 
in August 2007, and this first vessel is now working 
with a major international oil company operating in 
the US Gulf of Mexico. The vessels are named the 
Rigdon 4000 series because they can carry 4000bbls 
of liquid mud, one of their main selling features. 
The vessels were designed under the guidance of 
Guido Perla and Associates, and built by Bollinger 
Shipyards.
The PSVs have a length overall of 57.95m, a length bp 
of 54.90m, and a depth of 5.50m. With a gross tonnage 
of 1600tonnes, and a draught of 4.30m, the vessels can 
reach maximum speeds of 13knots, at light draught. 
In fact, the vessels have been designed to maintain a 
speed of 12knots at loadline (fully loaded condition), 
thought to be up to 30% faster than most existing 
vessels of equal size.
The engine package consists of two KTA-50DM1 
producing 1235kW and one KTA-19DM1 producing 
425kW main propulsion generators, and one 6BTA5.9G 
producing 85kW for a SOLAS emergency standby 
unit. This environmentally-friendly diesel-electric 
propulsion uses less fuel than conventional direct drive 
systems and produces far less pollution.  
The engines are connected to the vessel management 
system by means of a Mod Bus arrangement supplied 
by CMSL, using Auto Maskin panels. These tier into 
a Techsol vessel management system and a Frank 
L Bier DP system. EPD provided the entire vessel 
power management system, including all motor control 
centres, SCR system, and the actual drive motors 
themselves. Karl Senner Inc supplied the Steer Prop 
steerable propeller system. 
Two azimuthing Z-Drives and one fixed L-Drive 
aft, and two large tunnel thrusters forward, all assist in 
making the 4000 series a faster, more manoeuvrable, 
more stable, and safer vessel than traditional medium-
sized vessels, it is claimed. First and Ten and her sister 
PSVs will be capable of serving the widest array of 
applications in all water depths. 
First and Ten is classed by the American Bureau of 
Shipping to: Dynamic Positioning-2 (DP-2), with a 
diesel-electric propulsion arrangement. This system 
provides fuel efficiency and performance redundancy. 
The vessels are DPII and fully diesel electric with SCR 
DC drives. A unique feature is the engineroom which is 
located at the first deck level. Not only does this allow 
for more bulk storage capability under the main deck, 
but it also allows for ease of maintenance and repair by 
key vendors such as Cummins and AVK. 
The Rigdon 4000 PSVs can transport up to 4000 
barrels of liquid mud in an independent and fully-
segregated, self-cleaning oval tank system, and have 
the ability to deliver 100% of their mud cargo to an 
offshore rig while greatly reducing the client’s expense 
of tank cleaning. The liquid mud tank capacity and 
delivery capabilities are typically found only in much 
larger vessels. The oval liquid mud tanks with a self-
cleaning system provide maximum circulation and are 
more cost-effective to clean than traditional square 
tanks.

eograph, yard no 1678, was built by Fjellstrand 
A/S, of Norway, and was delivered in October 
2007.  This ROV/survey vessel has been constructed 
with dynamic positioning and can reach speeds 
of 17knots. The vessel has now joined Geograph 
Shipping’s subsidiary, Geo ASA’s, fleet of offshore 
vessels. The contract for this agreement had a value 
of approximately Nkr130 million. 
The hull was originally built as a trawler in Romania, 
and was converted and outfitted with very advanced 
survey equipment. It is hoped that Geograph will 
consolidate Geoconsult's position within seabed 
mapping. Geo ASA supplied the hull and some of 
the equipment to be installed. Glesvær Ship Design 
carried out the technical specification and drawings 
of the vessel.
The vessel has a length overall of 70m, a length bp 
of 61.8m, a beam of 14.6m, and a draught of 5.8m. 
Geograph has a gross tonnage of approximately 2600gt, 
and a net tonnage of approximately 830nt. A generous 
deck area of 370m² has been provided, which has a 
substantial total load of 500tonnes. The vessel has been 
classified by Det Norske Veritas to: +1A1, ICE-1B, E0, 
DYNPOS-AUTR, Dk+.
Equipped with two Caterpillar 3612TA main engines 
producing 3460kW (900rev/min), the vessel has a 
service speed of 11knots-12 knots, but can reach speeds 
of 14knots-15knots on installation of a propeller, and a 
top speed of 17knots has been recorded. Two Caterpillar 
C18TTA auxiliary engines of 601kW at 1800rev/min 
and two Stamford HCM534F-2 generators of 550kW 
have also been installed.
Propulsion is via two TCNS 073 retractable stern 
thrusters, supplied by Rolls-Royce, which have an 
output of 1000kW. Two bow thrusters have also been 
fitted. One is a tunnel thruster of type 375 TW, also 
from Rolls-Royce, that gives an output of 900kW; the 
other a retractable Rolls-Royce Azimuth thruster, type 
TCNS 073, with an output of 883kW.
The sophisticated dynamic positioning (DP 11) 
system onboard Geograph includes a Kongsberg SDP 
21; a Kongsberg Seapath 200 (DGPS); two DGPS (one 
POSMV and one DPS132); a Kongsberg Radius 1000; 
and two dual mode Simrad HiPAP 500s.
As would be expected of a survey vessel, a range 
of deck equipment has been supplied, including two 
capstans, an anchor winch, and a crane. This crane, 
from National Oilwell, has a capacity of 20tonnes at 
9m double fall – AHC, or 10tonnes at 18.5m single 
fall, 1500m wire.
Accomodation has been provided for 50 persons 
in 33 cabins. There are 18 one-person cabins; 14 
two-person cabins, and one four-person cabin. Also 
provided are a conference room, Internet café, offices, 
online/offline rooms, dayrooms, mess, and a gym. 
Lifesaving equipment supplied includes a Norsafe 
Magnum 750; a Vestdavit PLR-3250; six 25-person  
liferafts from Viking; 56 survival suits; and 68 
lifejackets.

G
rampian Talisman is the first of a pair platform 
supply vessels, with standby emergency 
response and rescue operation capabilities, to be 
built by Balenciaga for its long-term customer North 
Star Shipping Ltd, based in Aberdeen, Scotland. 
Balenciaga first delivered Grampian Surveyor (Significant 
Small Ships of 2003) in 2003, and over the past two 
years a series of five dedicated standby rescue vessels, 
all of them to designs by IMT Marine Consultants. 
The concept design work was carried out by IMT, 
in close cooperation with the shipowner. This design 
has received the design reference number IMT978, 
prominent on the ship's superstructure.
The vessel design stands out with its unusual bow 
profile, with a semi-bulbous bow emerging well above 
the waterline, which allows for a longer waterline 
length than a conventional bow on a vessel of this kind. 
This has permitted speeds of 13knots to be achieved 
in trials.
Typical on this type of vessel, the superstructure 
is set well forward allowing for a 700m2 cargo deck. 
As a PSV vessel, the accommodation is laid out for a 
crew capacity for up to 18 persons, all in single cabins 
with own ensuite. There is one deck fully dedicated 
to survivor accommodation, and treatment areas in 
compliance with UKOOA Class B Standby Vessel 
regulations, with capacity for up to 300 recovered 
people. 
The 740m² cargo deck has a design strength of 
5tonnes/m2 and the maximum deck load capacity is 
approximately 1300tonnes. The ship has a deadweight 
of 3610tonnes.
The vessel is driven by a twin MaK 6M25 main 
engine plant, each developing 1980kW whilst turning 
at 750rev/min. Each engine drives a Scana Volda 
controllable propeller propulsion system fitted with 
open water propeller, through a flexible coupling. 
Commanding of the engine and propeller is by means 
of controls comfortably placed on both the fore and aft 
consoles in the wheelhouse.
For manoeuvring purposes, the vessel has two 
Schottel STT 2CP CP tunnel thrusters forward and 
two aft, rated at 590kW each, which can be driven 
separately by their dedicated control, both at forward 
and aft control stations, or in conjunction with the 
main propeller and steering system by means of the 
independent joystick system. The Van der Velden 
steering system is comprised by two independent 
electro-hydraulic power packs driving each a spade-
type high lift rudder, which can operate in tandem or 
independently from each other.
The ship’s electrical needs are covered by a pair of 
generating sets and two main engine-driven shaft 
alternators. The generating plant is composed of two 
Volvo D12-Aux generating sets, sited at the forward 
end of the engineroom, capable of producing 350KWe 
at 1800rev/min each. There is also a Volvo TAMD D9 
190kWe emergency/harbour generating set fitted on the 
main deck. Additionally to these, there are two Leroy 
Somer shaft alternators of 1500Kwe, driven off the 
PTO of the gearbox.
All propulsion units can be operated by means of 
their individual controls from the fore and aft stations 
in the wheelhouse, as well as from the independent 
joystick system provided, which has three fixed control 
panels, one each on bridge wings and in the aft 
control console of the wheelhouse. The twin propeller 
and high lift rudder combination, together with the 
electrically-driven tunnel thrusters when controlled 
by the Masterstick joystick system, give the ship 
excellent manoeuvrability and necessary control for  
station-keeping. 
In accordance with the UMS class notation, the 
vessel is fitted with an alarm and monitoring system, 
as part of an integrated automation system, which is 
also interfaced to the tank level and draught measuring, 
a cargo pumping system and a loading computer, as 
typically found in this vessel type. All cargo valves and 
pumps are remotely operated from mimics displayed in 
four operator stations around the vessel.
The mooring and deck equipment onboard includes 
two capstans on the aft deck quarters, two tugger 
winches on the aft end of the upper deck, split windlasses 
on the fore deck, and a hydraulic knuckle boom crane, 
with a capacity of 1.8tonnes at 18m outreach. 
The accommodation is divided into four levels with 
the wheelhouse being the fifth. At main deck level the 
crew’s daytime living spaces are found, including the 
changing room, laundry, crew’s mess, galley, and day 
rooms suitably outfitted with audio-visual entertainment 
centres, as well as dry provision and refrigerated stores.
On the upper deck, safe and direct access is afforded 
from the FRC (and Daughter craft when retro-fitted for 
standby duties) boarding platform. All the regulatory 
zones and equipment, required for this kind of vessel, 
have been carefully studied and laid out to enhance a 
speedy access and flow of survivors to the reception, 
treatment room, recovery room, and seating areas. 
All of the crew’s quarters are sited on the forecastle 
and upper forecastle decks, below the wheelhouse. The 
forecastle deck is devoted to crew accommodation and 
rescue boat crew changing room. The upper forecastle 
deck holds the captains and chief engineers cabins, as 
well as officer cabins and client cabins, all of them with 
washroom facilities. The ship’s office and instrument 
room is also found on this level. 
For possible future requirement to perform rescue 
operations, in lieu of a standard SOLAS MOB, the 
vessel is provided with an Avon Searider 65m fast rescue 
craft which is deployed by a MacGregor hydraulically-
operated davit. Other appliances for rescuing survivors 
from the water shall be fitted in the event it is required to 
perform such operations. The vessel is further prepared 
for retrofitting a daughter craft on starboard side, on the 
boat deck, should such capability be called for.

n February 2007, the new RAnger 3900 Class 
fireboat Guan Xiao Yi Hao was delivered to the 
Port Authority of Dongguan, China by the builder 
Wang Tak Engineering and Shipbuilding Co Ltd of 
Hong Kong. 
The vessel was designed by Robert Allan Ltd, of 
Vancouver, Canada, and is one of the first of that 
company's new RAnger Class emergency response 
vessels. The Dongguan fireboat is thought to be 
one of the largest and most capable boats in the 
region, and has sparked interest in several other 
communities in China with similar fire protection 
needs.
The new fast response fireboats are designed to 
specifically address the firefighting and rescue needs of 
the local port area, which is contained entirely within 
the local river estuary. Consequently, the fireboat has 
both water depth and air draught constraints, the latter 
to deal with numerous local bridges.
The new fireboats have a length overall of 38.90m, 
a length waterline of 36.05m, a moulded beam of 
9.00m, a moulded depth of 4.46m, and a maximum 
draught of 2.20m. 
Guan Xiao Yi Hao, and sisters, have been 
designed for a response speed of 15knots, with a 
low-wake, 11knots-12knots cruising/patrol speed. 
The powering, sea-keeping, and wake generation 
characteristics of the semi-displacement hull form 
were all verified in an extensive model-testing 
programme. On trials, the vessels achieved a full 
load speed of 16knots.
The installed propulsion power is 2 x 1118kW 
from two Caterpillar 3512B main engines. Propellers 
are FP, driven through a pair of ZF Model W4610 
reduction gears with a 3.5:1 reduction ratio.
The firefighting equipment for the new fireboats, 
which is effectively a Fi-Fi1 international standard, 
comprises the following two 1500m3/hour fire 
pumps driven through a power take-off on the front 
of each main engine; two 1500m3/hour water only 
fire monitors; and two 600m3/hour water/foam 
monitors.  
A fire equipment room has been outfitted to store 
hoses, fittings, rescue equipment, etc, and is accessed 
by a 2m wide double-door. There are multiple 
hydrant outlets for water supply to shore systems, 
and a crane fitted with telescoping ladder for high 
level water stream and access has been fitted.
Guan Xiao Yi Hao has been designed with the 
wheelhouse arranged with maximum, all-round 
visibility, including an elevated engineer's control 
station aft of the main console.
On the main deck a command centre is a 
sophisticated 
communications 
centre/meeting 
room for coordinating on-scene activities with land 
based resources. A large working deck areas ensures 
generous access along house sides.
Other notable rooms onboard include a master's 
cabin, a small meeting room/office, and a large water 
level rescue platform for casualty recovery. Crew 
accommodation has been outfitted to house up to 
eight live-aboard crew or provide rest area in the 
event of extended operations.

heoy Lee Shipyards delivered two Ramparts 
3000 tugs, named Harry Evans and Peter Crooke, 
in November 2007. The RAmparts 3000 originates 
from the design office of Canadian naval architect 
Robert Allan and is the first to be built in China. 
Yard numbers 4908 and 4909 are the first two in 
a batch of six of these 30m long, 56tonne ahead and 
53tonnes astern bollard pull, 12knot tugs. All are 
destined for large mining operations in Australia, as 
well as ship berthing, escort work, and offshore towing 
duties. 
Harry Evans and Peter Crooke are fitted with a pair of 
Caterpillar 3516 B diesel engines, each rated 1685kW 
at 1600rev/min, driving a Rolls-Royce model US 205 
Z-drive with a 2400mm diameter propeller through 
a twin disc slipping clutch and a straight line shafting 
system. The subsequent four vessels in the series are 
being fitted with larger Niigata 2500hp units. Fuel 
capacity is 78,000litres, and water, 26,000litres.
The vessels were was built and classed to Lloyd's 
Register of Shipping notation: +100 A1 Tug, Fire-
fighting Ship 1 with waterspray, +LMC, UMS. 
This version of the RAmparts 3000 tug design 
incorporates a fairly large ‘escort skeg’ to enhance the 
indirect towing capability of the tug. Although this 
design is not considered as an aggressive escort tug, the 
skeg will enable the execution of very effective indirect 
manoeuvres and also provide enhanced sea-keeping 
and directional stability. The capacities of this tug were 
also tailored to the unique client requirements.
Harry Evans is outfitted for a crew of eight persons 
in comfortable quarters. In addition to a very spacious 
mess/lounge area the tug has a large combination 
switchboard room and office on the main deck, 
enabling the engineers to maintain watch without being 
subjected to the continuous noise of the engineroom. 
On entry into the deckhouse through the aft 
bulkhead, there is a generous ‘wet room’ which includes 
washing-up and laundry facilities, as well as wet-gear 
storage. From the same lobby area one can access the 
engineroom, thus the arrangement provides a useful 
noise barrier between the machinery space and the 
accommodation. 
The main winch forward, supplied by Kraaijeveld, 
is a divided drum, hydraulic type, each with a capacity 
for 110m of 80mm synthetic hawser. There is also an 
aft towing winch, fitted with 220m of steel wire. This 
feeds through a large aft bitt which in turn supports a 
55tonne SWL radial-arm tow-hook. The towing suite 
is completed by a set of hydraulic tow-pins built into 
the aft bulwarks. 
Fendering comprises a fairly typical array of 800mm 
diameter cylindrical upper fender, above a row of ‘W’ 
fenders. The sheer line aft is protected by ‘D’ rubber 
and the forecastle sides forward by a row of aircraft 
tires. 
The tug is rated for a full Fi-Fi1 notation, with two 
main-engine driven pumps rated 1200m3/hour each, 
supplying water to a pair of remote-controlled monitors 
forward. There is also a Fi-Fi foam capability, carried in 
a 5000litre, independent stainless steel tank.

O
n 22 July 2005, Gdańsk Shiprepair Yard 
Remontowa SA and Agip KCO signed a contract 
for the construction and delivery of four specialised 
icebreaking emergency evacuation vessels (IBEEV), 
yard numbers B 843/1-4. The contract also provided 
the owners with an option to order four additional 
sisterships, of which two were confirmed later in 
February 2007.
The first two vessels, IBEEV-01 and IBEEV-02, 
were delivered in September 2006, the second two, 
IBEEV-03 and IBEEV-04, in March 2007, and the 
last two vessels, IBEEV-05 and IBEEV-06, are set for 
delivery in September 2008.
The vessels are designed to be used to carry out the 
emergency evacuation of personnel from offshore 
installations located in the Kashagan Field, which is 
currently one of the largest offshore developments in 
the world, and which forms part of the Kazakhstan 
Economical zone.  
Basic front-end engineering design was developed 
by Robert Allan Ltd in close cooperation with AGIP 
KCO. Classification design and workshop drawings of 
the vessel were provided by the yard’s subsidiary, Naval 
Engineering & Design Ltd, from Poland. IBEEV 
represents state-of-the-art technology and will comply 
to Det Norske Veritas notation +1A1 ICE 1B DAT 
(-30°C).
IBEEV-3 measures 45.10m in length, 8.0m in beam, 
and 3.60m in depth. The specific requirements of Agip 
KCO, as well as the onerous environmental operating 
conditions, greatly challenged the yard to develop 
tailor-made solutions for this project.
Special focus has been put on the development of 
the propulsion solution, allowing the vessels to operate 
safely within a toxic/hydrocarbon environment. 
Combustion air is provided by a specialised installation 
consisting of 16 high pressure cylinders storing air 
compressed to 350bar, decompressed via pressure 
reducing panels and supplied to the engines.
IBEEV-3 has a diesel electric propulsion system, 
consisting of two 856kW diesel-electric prime movers 
running at 1500rev/min and driving twin azimuth 
thrusters rated at 550kW at 1500rev/min.
The winter ice conditions prevailing in the north 
east Caspian resulted in the designers developing a hull 
form with the capability for vessel operation in 'first 
year' ice (0.6m thick), which was proved by extensive 
model tests. The shallow waters of the Caspian Sea also 
required tight design control over draught of the vessel, 
which is not to exceed 2.0m in the summer and 2.1m 
in winter conditions. Environmental factors were also 
taken into account, resulting in the application of ‘no 
discharge’ equipment and fulfilment of requirements of 
MARPOL, as well as other international conventions.
IBEEV-3 is designed to evacuate 340 persons at a 
time. Evacuees will enter the vessels through evacuation 
tunnels linking each vessel to the Kashagan ‘D’-Island 
facility, they will then enter the vessel via an air lock 
which will be purged using stored air from cylinders. 
Afterwards, the evacuees will proceed forward through 
the vessel, to one of three hermetically sealed evacuee 
compartments. 
During evacuation, personal CO2 scrubbers and re-
breather sets will be provided to each of the evacuees. 
Solid-state chlorate candles will be used to generate 
additional oxygen in the evacuee compartments as the 
oxygen levels are depleted by the evacuees.

S
trategic Marine delivered its first passenger ferry 
to Compagnie Corsaire this year, the 37.5m 
monohull aluminium passenger ferry which began 
its operations in early August 2007. The vessel is to 
be based in St Malo, France. 
Compagnie Corsaire’s operations currently consist of 
four monohulls that are engaged in tourist excursions 
around the Cherbourg Peninsular. Jacque Cartier will be 
the first fast ferry in the company’s fleet and the first 
to operate the St Malo to Jersey route.
The vessels' operations will consist of a rigorous 
schedule of daily departures from St Malo to Jersey, an 
eight-and-a-half hour journey in total. During the busy 
months of the year Compagnie Corsaire may add an 
additional journey to meet demand.
The hull (originally constructed by Wavemaster 
International) was purchase by Strategic Marine when 
Wavemaster ceased operations in 2003. The vessel was 
approximately 60% complete when Strategic Marine 
took the project on. It was not until Compagnie 
Corsaire purchased the monohull ferry in late 2006, 
that Strategic Marine kick-started the project and 
worked towards completing the vessel for handover.
The vessel has a length waterline of 31.6m, a beam 
moulded of 7.0m, a moulded depth of 2.5m, and a 
maximum draught of 2.3m.
Jacque Cartier is powered by three MTU 12V 2000 
M70 diesels rated at 788kW at 2100rev/min. The MTU 
units each drive a FP propeller via a ZF 2050 gearbox. 
In addition to this, a Scandia Nidaros bow thruster was 
installed to meet the manoeuvrability requirement of 
the operator. The vessel cab reach speeds of 29knots at 
100% MCR, and has a range of 527nm.
The passenger accommodation is located on the main 
deck area and consists of 203 Beurteaux 300 series 
seats. The main accommodation area also consists 
of two kiosks, luggage racks amidships, and four aft 
toilets.

N
orthrop Grumman Corp’s Integrated Systems 
(NGIS) sector has long been known as an aircraft 
builder and systems integrator. The nature of warfare 
today, however, demands that information, such as 
that which can be acquired and used by planes, be 
available to everyone in a fight, from the general in a 
command centre in the USA to a marine on the ground, 
somewhere in the world.
Realising that, Integrated Systems engineers began to 
apply network-centric warfare skills to ships, working 
with a sister sector on the DDG1000, CG(X), and 
CVN21 programmes, and winning a contract to be the 
mission package integrator for the US Navy’s Littoral 
Combat Ship. It began looking for other markets for 
its skills. 
Meanwhile, Aluminum Chambered Boats (ACB), of 
Washington, had designed and patented a line of vessels 
whose technology incorporated several innovations.  
ACB and NGIS had many intense discussions 
regarding their views of the global opportunities for a 
JMEC type of craft. ACB needed a C4ISR ‘partner’ for 
JMEC and NGIS needed a watercraft ‘partner’ for its 
C4ISR. With terrorists often hiding in the reeds along 
rivers, and pirates operating in strategic straits around 
the world, marrying the two companies’ skill to fight 
those threats made much sense.
Their offspring is the Joint Multi-Mission Expeditionary 
Craft (JMEC). JMEC integrates Northrop Grumman's 
leading-edge navigation, surveillance, network and 
command, and control systems onboard an innovative, 
tactical-class hull form designed and built by ACB.
The boat itself has unique attributes. ACB applied 
its patented, Sealed Air Chamber design to the boat, 
adding visual and acoustic signature treatments.  JMEC 
is 12.25m long with a 3m beam, and a draught of only 
0.7m. 
Powered by two Cummins QSC 8.3litre, 540hp 
turbocharged diesel engines, and twin UltraJet 340s, 
the JMEC has a top speed of greater than 40knots. 
With a crew of four, the new boat has room for another 
two observers and, depending on the mission, can also 
ferry a 14-member combat team or various cargoes up 
rivers or streams. 
The hull design allows JMEC to operate in just 
millimetres of water at speed. The craft is able to 
perform an emergency stop in just one-and-a-half 
boat lengths and has the manoeuvring capabilities of 
a helicopter. This is achieved with the new Ultrajet-
JetMaster joystick control system. JMEC can operate 
up river and 50nm offshore. ACB has also developed 
a new armour technology that could be used on other 
land and sea craft, too.
Dimensionally, JMEC is capable of fitting a Stryker 
size vehicle; however, the total weight of the vehicle 
grossly exceeds the weight carrying capacity of JMEC. 
The current configuration/size will accommodate the 
wheel base for a fast attack vehicle (FAV). Any air 
droppable vehicle that fits on a standard 463L pallet 
(air force) is capable of being transported in the current 
configuration/size watercraft.
The heart of the boat is the information centre. In the 
early decades of war on terror, the US Navy, for example, 
re-entered the riverine ‘brown water’ domain, which 
required extensive situational awareness and command 
and control capabilities. Northrop Grumman and ACB 
believed it was time to evolve and experiment with a 
comprehensive concept of operations to service the war 
on terror-focused expeditionary war fighter.
Their idea was to offer the expeditionary war fighter, 
those involved with policing shipping lanes and 
harbours, interdicting drug runners, and others with 
the most capable and flexible set of tools, processes, 
technologies, and capabilities available.
Thus, Northrop Grumman inserted a number of 
systems into ACB’s 12m, high-performance hull to 
demonstrate some of its potential. These included 
an integrated electro-optical/infrared sensor; radar 
sensors giving a 360deg field of view; integrated, 
common operator workstations having selectable crew 
station functions and displaying information on 431mm 
colour monitors with night vision capability; wireless 
intercom with active noise cancellation, VHF/UHF 
radios with line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight and 
Internet protocol technology and growth provisions for 
HF radios; and an airborne sensor data link.  
Weaponry includes a pedestal mounted stabilised, 
remotely operated gun platform atop the cabin that can 
accept a .50 calibre machine gun, a GAU-30 Gatling 
gun or other weaponry, and is operated from with the 
cabin.

A 
contract for two 88m high-speed vehicle-
passenger catamarans was signed with the 
Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Austal in 
2005. To be operated by Istanbul Deniz Otobusleri 
(IDO), the identical new ferries are called Osman 
Gazi-1 and Orhan Gazi-1, and were delivered in April 
and September respectively. 
The craft have a capacity to carry 1200 passengers and 
225 cars or 126 lane metres of trucks plus 158 cars.  The 
new Austal ferries are designated to operate on a 39nm 
reciprocal service across the Marmara Sea between 
Yenikapi (Istanbul) and a new port development in 
Mudanya servicing the city of Bursa.
Each ferry is powered by four MTU 20 cylinder 8000 
series diesel engines driving a Lips propulsion system 
through four Reintjes gearboxes. This combination 
was specifically developed to achieve the performance 
targets with 1200 passengers and 225 cars onboard.
The vessels have an impressive maximum deadweight 
of 470tonnes and are designed to operate with this load 
at speeds in excess of 36knots utilising only 90% of 
maximum engine power.
The performance of the fast ferry was impressive on 
official sea trials, with a higher than contract speed of 
37.4knots achieved at operating deadweight, 90% MCR 
(power), and with operational ride control system. 
With four MTU 20V8000 M71R engines installed 
at the reduced (R) maximum rating of 7200kW at 
1150rev/min, this allows for low engine stresses, 
increased fuel efficiency, and longer intervals between 
engine overhauls. The main engines exhaust via dry 
stacks to keep fumes away from passengers during 
boarding and departure.
Passenger comfort at high speed is aided by Austal’s 
fully active SeaState Ride Control System featuring 
forward T-foils and transom mounted interceptors 
providing dynamic pitch and roll stabilisation in higher 
sea states.
The vehicle deck on the new ferries offers a clear 
height of 4.0m under the raised mezzanine decks, 
which are being installed for the first time on a Turkish 
fast ferry enabling greater flexibility in seasonal load 
handling. 
Passenger accommodation is located on two decks: 
the tourist class upper deck for 922 passengers, with 
360deg panoramic window views, also providing 
catering and shopping facilities and a children’s 
recreational area. The bridge deck accommodates 278 
business class passengers. Two additional VIP cabins 
provide lounge seating for 16.
Passenger loading is enhanced by specialised boarding 
ramps and entrances that enable safe, simultaneous 
movement of vehicle and passenger traffic.
The vessels were built in accordance with the 
requirements and under the survey of Germanischer 
Lloyd, conforming to International Maritime 
Organization codes, and Turkish Flag and Port State 
regulations.

P
rovider is a South Catamaran 44/14m alloy supply 
vessel that was built by South Boats Special 
Projects Ltd for MBL Supply, of Gothenburg, 
Sweden. The vessel is now working on the Q7 
offshore wind farm from Ijmuiden, The Netherlands, 
where she is believed to be the first service vessel to 
carry three spare gearboxes on the after deck.  
This offshore cargo supply vessel measures 14.1m 
length overall, 6.3m beam overall, has a draught of 
1.4m, and has a lightship displacement (including 
fluids) of 24.2tonnes.  The unique ability of this vessel 
is the ability to carry 12 passengers, two crew, fluids, 
and 10tonnes of deck payload totalling 36.6tonnes, 
cruising at over 20knots. A remarkable achievement, 
and thought not to be rivalled in class.
The vessel follows standard South Boats design 
principles with symmetrical underwater sections and 
asymmetrical wet deck knuckles and spray deflectors. 
The design includes a high buoyancy bow and triple 
internal spray knuckles to maintain a suspension of 
air/water to dampen pitching moments, particularly 
in heavy weather.  
In addition, the hulls maintain a parallel waterline 
beam through the length of the vessel, allowing for 
good weight distribution around the vessel.  The design 
offers class leading sea-keeping, stability, fuel efficiency, 
and manoeuvrability. The sea-keeping in particular 
has been proven in service operating in excess of 2.5m 
significant wave height.
The vessel is fabricated of aluminium and is generally 
in accordance with Lloyd’s Special Service Craft Rules 
with all metal of marine grade 50830 and 6082T6 
extrusions meeting the requirements of Lloyd's Register 
of Shipping and Det Norske Veritas. In addition, 
the vessel has been built to the Swedish Maritime 
Authority regulations and could be coded to carry 24 
passengers in the future.
The vessel features an ‘island’ wheelhouse forward 
and a 40m2 working deck aft. Deck equipment includes 
a raised Palfinger PK10000M fully folding knuckle 
boom crane capable of lifting over 1tonne at 8.3m.  The 
crane dominates the transom of the vessel but at the 
bow there is an MkIV bow loading platform to enable 
the vessel to work on offshore wind farms, and also a 
Spencer Carter hydraulic capstan package.
The wheelhouse is accessed from the after deck 
through a Seaglaze part-glazed aluminium door and is 
fitted with an ‘L’ shaped bench seat to starboard with 
stowage lockers beneath providing seating for up to 
eight passengers.  
Forward to port are two KAB214 crew seats complete 
with hip guards and lap belts. The dominant ‘wrap 
around’ central helm is fitted with a KAB525 complete 
head rest and lap belt mounted within the console.  The 
console is equipped with electronic engine and steering 
controls either side of the seat, manoeuvring joystick, 
Interceptor control panel, fire control, and local control 
switches all within easy reach.  
The vessel is equipped with an IMO-approved 
Furuno electronics package comprising Radar (with 
ARPA & AIS tracking), Video Sounder, twin GPS 
sets, Navtex, Class A GMDSS Radio, Class D GMDSS 
Radio, Class A AIS, and full PC-based Transas chart 
plotting.
The ergonomic helm position has full visibility 
of the boarding area and allows for observation of 
pilots ascending and descending ships ladders though 
large tinted ‘pilot style’ observation windows in the 
wheelhouse roof.
The accommodation void is accessed from the 
wheelhouse and features twin single berths in a 
fully lined and insulated compartment beneath the 
wheelhouse. 
The propulsion is claimed to be unique, being the 
first commercial installation of Volvo Penta IPS850, 
featuring D11 main engines rated at 500kW each 
coupled to Volvo’s unique forward facing duo prop 
drive pod, complete with integral exhaust and sea inlet 
systems.  
This propulsion package offers the vessel a sprint 
speed of 30knots (with nearly 33knots recorded 
on trials) and a 26knot cruising speed at 2100rev/
min (combined 198litres/h). At low cruising speeds 
(18knots at 1700rev/min), the vessel offers a frugal 
fuel consumption of 120litres/h. At full 36tonne 
displacement with full compliment of passengers, crew, 
and 10tonnes of deck cargo, the vessel can still achieve 
speeds in excess of 24knots, well in excess of yard and 
client expectations.
The vessel is fitted with four helm positions 
(wheelhouse, port side deck, starboard side deck, aft 
deck crane position) all with an electronic steering 
wheel, throttle set, IPS joystick, EVC engine and fuel 
monitoring, and station control pad.  
The joystick control enables the vessel to have 
uncompromised manoeuvrability with the ship moving 
proportionally to the joystick, even bodily sideways, 
which is essential during cargo transfer operations. 
In addition, Volvo’s new Interceptor and ride control 
system has been fitted, allowing for control of trim 
whilst carrying cargo.

T
he Port of Liverpool's new Wildcat 40, Royal 
Charter, is a survey vessel built by Safehaven 
Marine. The vessel is the first of the new 12.1m 
versions of Safehaven’s Wildcat, and features a hull 
lengthened by 1m, and this has improved the design’s 
performance with a lower running trim, smoother 
ride, and improved sound levels as a result of the 
further aft position of the engines.
The Port of Liverpool opted for a twin hull 
design as a result of its intention to use sophisticated  
multi-beam sonar equipment. The deployment of the 
valuable sonar head and its subsequent protection made 
the choice of catamaran a logical step, as by deploying 
the sonar head through a moonpool in the bridge deck 
at the vessel's LGG, means it is fully protected between 
the twin hulls, and being at the centre of the craft, 
pitch, and heel motions are minimised, maximising the 
accuracy of collected data. 
The vessel has a breadth of 4.57m, and a draught of 
1.2m. A displacement of 13,000kg and a gross tonnage 
of 21gt have been recorded. Royal Charter meets MCA 
regulation Category II 60nm offshore licensed for 12 
persons. 
On a quite substantial lightship displacement of 
12,300kg, Royal Charter achieved a very impressive 
speed of 27knots, exceeding her contract speed by a 
large margin and with very low noise levels of 79.8db at 
18knots-19knots. The sonar head can be raised through 
the moonpool hatch for fast transit speeds of 22knots. 
The vessel is powered by twin Caterpillar 3126 
engines rated at 385hp, and is also fitted with two 
Twin Disc MG5061A gearboxes. Propulsion is via 
two Clements Engineering propellers which have a 
diameter of 584mm, and a Side Power bow thruster.
A 10kVA generator supplying 240v onboard through 
a full ring circuit, a large survey bench, and a dedicated 
survey position facing forward alongside the helm 
allow Royal Charter's crew to operate in an efficient 
and comfortable environment, enhanced by onboard 
air-conditioning. A window arrangement for improved 
visibility features a new front and side window design 
with heated screens.
A HIAB crane on the aft deck and a stainless 
steel A frame for deploying sonar and grab sampling 
equipment have also been installed. 
Now in service, the port is said to be very happy with 
the vessel’s performance, the moonpool and sonar head 
deployment system works very well, with the Reason 
multi-beam sonar providing reportedly excellent 3D 
images of the sea bottom and making surveying and 
mapping of the port's waters fast and efficient.

BMA Marine Inc, shipbuilders based in Cebu, 
The Philippines, launched hull number 1023, 
Seascape 1, a 50m all-aluminium ro-pax ferry for the 
new South Australian operator Sea SA. 
Sea Scape 1 has replaced the existing vessel Seaway 
- built by FBMA in 2003 - on the new south Australian 
route crossing between Wallaroo and Lucky Bay on the 
Spencer Gulf. 
The vessel has been designed by the naval architects 
company Sea Transport Solutions, of Queensland, 
which developed its well-proven catamaran designs 
to meet the route and infrastructure requirements in 
south Australia. Using an innovative all-aluminium 
design, this new vessel has provided Sea SA with an 
efficient modern ferry for the six daily crossings. 
Sea Scape 1 has a length overall of 51.9m, a length 
waterline of 50.76m, a moulded breadth of 16.5m, 
a draught of 1.6m, and a depth of 3.4m. The vessel 
has a deadweight of 220dwt and a displacement of 
170tonnes.
Powered by four Cummins KTA19M3 447kW 
engines, and a Cummins side thruster, the vessel can 
cruise at a speed of approximately 15knots, and can 
reach top speeds of 18knots. Two auxiliary engines 
were also supplied by Cummins, and a reverse reduction 
gearbox has also been fitted. 
With a capacity for 300 passengers, the vessel has 
been furnished with fabric Berteaux seating with tables 
for 120 passengers. Television monitors, a café bar, 
and a play area have also been included for passenger 
comfort. 
The vessel has a capacity for 53 cars on the main deck 
and 12, or four trucks, on a central mezzanine. To allow 
tall trucks along the vessel’s centre lanes, the passenger 
areas are located starboard.

t the end of September two new ferries were 
delivered which operate short-haul passenger 
services across the Øresund between the Swedish 
port of Helsingborg and Helsingør in Denmark, for 
ACE-Link. The ships, which can carry twice as many 
passengers as the ones they have replaced, offer a 
modern cruise feeling on the short crossing.  
The vessels had their technical design carried out 
by Danish naval architects Knud E Hansen, while the 
exterior design was by Petter Yran, and interiors were 
created by Steen Friis Design.
Simara ACE and Siluna ACE are 60m in length, 25m 
longer than the vessels they have replaced. This means 
that they will offer generously sized public spaces 
and can easily carry 400 passengers over the route in 
comfort. Simara ACE and Siluna ACE operate under 
a Swedish flag.
The vessels have been built by Remontowa Shipyard 
in Gdansk, Poland, and are designed to meet the most 
stringent environmental and safety requirements. This 
includes completely sealed waste and water systems, 
engines which use low sulphur fuel, and an advanced 
catalytic conversion solution with the latest in particle 
filtration technology. 
The new ships will offer a smooth and stable passage 
due to their length. This is further improved through 
the use of retractable stabilisers which are designed to 
efficiently reduce roll. Crossing times are short, with 
an average passage of just 18 minutes. The vessels also 
have a rapid turn-around time and they operate from 
a centrally-placed part of the ports of Helsingborg 
and Helsingør, right in the hearts of the two town’s 
business centres.
Lloyd’s Register classed the ships to: 100A1, Passenger 
Ship, Ice 1C at: Max/Min draught (bottom of the keel) 
FP 2.91/2.61m AP 2.91/2.61m, Extended Protective 
Waters Service with the Limitation of Skagen in the 
north and Bornholm in the southeast +LMC, UMS.
The vessels are equipped with a diesel-electric 
propulsion system consisting of three Volvo Penta 
generator sets and two azimuth thrusters aft. The 
machinery also includes one side thruster in the bow 
with streamlined tunnels, one pair of heeling tanks, 
and one pair of fin stabilisers. Two FP Schottel 
thrusters with a speed of 356rev/min have also been 
installed. Simara ACE and Siluna ACE can reach speeds 
of 14knots and have a range of 2000nm.
Facilities onboard include a café deck and sun deck, 
a games arcade, a large shop, and a small sitting lounge 
located aft of the central hall. The restaurant deck is 
divided into two sections by the central stairway: an 
aft section, which holds a restaurant, and a forward 
section, which is arranged with café and pub. 
The crew area contains a crew mess, toilets, office, 
and one cabin. In the front, the bridge is arranged 
elevated for increased visibility over the bow.

I
n late February 2007 the high performance ASD 
terminal/escort tug Svitzer Sakhalin was delivered 
from ASL Shipyard, of Singapore, to owners, 
SvitzerWijsmuller of Copenhagen, Denmark. Svitzer 
Sakhalin is the first of four tugs being built to this 
new unique design, which will operate under a long-
term contract to Sakhalin Energy Investment Corp. 
The second vessel, Svitzer Aniva, arrived in Sakhalin 
in March. The last two tugs to the same design were 
built at Admiralty Shipyard, in St Petersburg, Russia, 
and were deliverd at the end of 2007. The design was 
developed for SvitzerWijsmuller by Robert Allan Ltd of 
Vancouver, Canada, under the direction of Jim Hyslop, 
project manager.
These heavy-duty ice-class tugs will be used at the 
Prigorodnoye oil export terminal and liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) plant, located near to Korsakov Port, in 
Aniva Bay, on the south coast of Sakhalin Island. The 
oil terminal and LNG plant will handle both crude oil 
and LNG exports. The tugs will be expected to fulfil 
duties which include ship berthing, buoy maintenance, 
ice channel breaking, and ice management, at the 
terminal.
The tugs were built to Lloyd's Register of Shipping 
requirements for a 100A1 Tug, Fi-Fi 1 with waterspray, 
LMC, UMS, IWS, Ice Class 1AS FS notation, as 
well as to the requirements of the Russian Maritime 
Register of Shipping for an ice class LU-5 notation for 
the hull only. The vessel also meets all SOLAS and 
International Loadline requirements.
Svitzer Sakhalin has a length overall of 34.5m, a 
moulded beam of 13.0m, a moulded depth of 6.8m, and 
an extreme draught of 6.1m.  
The new design was developed in response to a 
demanding statement of requirements, issued to 
industry for this project. The requirements included 
the ability to break 85cm of level ice at a minimum of 
3knots, perform harbour ice management, and when 
operating in pairs, break a channel wide enough for the 
tankers calling at the terminal. In addition, the tugs had 
to meet the stipulated minimum of 70tonnes bollard 
pull, and a speed of 12knots. 
In order to verify the design, an extensive series of 
model tests were commissioned by Robert Allan, and 
carried out at the HSVA, Hamburg, Germany, under 
the direction of Alan Reynolds of Offshore Research 
Ltd, Vancouver, on behalf of the designers. 
The programme focussed on the icebreaking 
performance of the tug, and was conducted as both 
towed and self-propelled tests.
The performance in ice exceeded all expectations, 
and in particular the ability of the tug to break out 
of an ice channel was exceptional. Very little ice-
propeller interaction was observed. The unique hull 
form incorporates an aggressive icebreaking ‘spoon’ 
bow, with shallow buttock angles in the ice contact 
zone, optimised for icebreaking performance. This 
shape merges into a modern ship-docking style bow, 
providing low contact pressures for tanker handling 
duties.
Additional design features developed to deal with 
the harsh winter environment in Sakhalin include 
underdeck heating and a large boiler/heat recovery 
system. The underwater hull is treated with Inerta 160 
low friction ice-capable coating.
The propulsion system comprises a pair of Bergen 
Model C25:33L8P diesel engines, each rated 2395kW at 
1000rev/min, driving a Rolls-Royce model US 305CPP 
Z-drive thruster. This combination delivers a bollard 
pull of 73tonnes, and a free running speed in excess 
of 13.5knots.
The main hawser winch is a double drum, hydraulic 
winch supplied by Rolls-Royce. Both drums have 
a capacity for 110m of 120mm diameter synthetic 
hawser. The brake capacity is 180tonnes. Aft is a single 
drum towing winch, with a capacity for 800m of 52mm 
SWR, and with a brake capacity of 180tonnes. The 
latter is located in a fully enclosed shelter.
Additional deck equipment includes a large utility/
buoy-handling crane by Norcrane, rated 10tonnes at 
8m outreach, a 10tonne tugger winch, shark jaws and 
tow-pins mounted flush with the main deck aft (first 
pair of tugs only), ahead of a 4m long x 1000mm OD 
stern roller. There is also deck space for storage of two 
20' containers.
The tug is equipped to a full Fi-Fi1 (with waterspray) 
classification, with two main-engine driven pumps, 
with a total capacity of 2800m3 per hour. 
The ship's service generators are a pair of Volvo D9 
MG gensets, each rated at 225kW, delivering 400volts/3 
phase/50Hz power throughout the ship. There is also a 
24kW air-cooled emergency generator.
These tugs are outfitted to a high standard for a crew 
of six persons, plus two client representatives. The 
officer's cabins include private en suite facilities, and 
others share a common lavatory/shower facility. There 
is a spacious lounge/mess area and a fully equipped 
modern galley.

åtservice Mandal A/S, part of the Norwegian 
Båtservice Group, delivered the passenger-car 
catamaran 30m Tansøy at the end of January.  This 
small and efficient vessel, the first of its kind, is 
now operating in the Norwegian Florø area, and its 
archipelago for the Norwegian road-ferry operator 
Fjord1 Fylkesbaatane.
The Kombi catamaran was designed by naval 
architect Ola Lilloe-Olsen, and was further 
developed in cooperation between the owner 
and builder. A second vessel has also now been 
ordered, with minor amendments to the original 
design.
The vessel has a length of 29.45m, a breadth 
of 9.00m, and a draught of 1.85m. Tansøy’s depth 
to the main deck measures 2.85m. The vessel 
has been classified to the Norwegian Maritime 
Directory standards. 
The vessel has been equipped with a pair of 
Caterpillar main engines, model 12VC32, which 
each produce 1045kW at 2100rev/min. In addition, 
a CP propeller with a diameter of 1.2m, and a 
pair of 60kW tunnel thrusters forward were also 
fitted.  
This equipment ensures that Tansøy can reach 
speeds of 28knots with a normal cargo load, and 
22knots in cargo operation; with 25tonnes of 
deck cargo. The vessel can reach top speeds of 
32knots.  
The catamaran has lounge seats for 96 passengers 
and a separate room for transportation of patients 
has also been provided. Located on the bridge deck 
is a separate lounge fitted with galley equipment. 
The car deck aft, with an area of 110m2, is fitted 
with a stern ramp and can carry 10 cars, or one 
lorry and four private cars. Up to 96 passengers 
can be carried.
The vessel has also been specified to carry 
dangerous cargo and this cargo can be lifted 
onboard using the Bergen Hydraulikk Palfinger 
18tonnes/m deck crane that has been fitted.

A 
contract to deliver 10 48m passenger catamaran 
ferries was awarded to Austal by Venetian 
Marketing Services Ltd (VMSL), and included 
meeting a challenging delivery schedule for the boats 
to be in operation in 2007 and 2008.
With the capacity to carry 411 passengers at a 
service speed of 42knots, the ferries will provide a 
link from Hong Kong locations to the new Pac On 
ferry terminal being built by the Macau Government 
to provide a service to The Cotai Strip, on Macau. The 
Cotai Strip will incorporate a wide range of shopping, 
entertainment, gaming, and convention activities that 
are currently being constructed.
When opened in 2007, the Venetian Macao will 
provide a fully integrated resort destination with 
unmatched entertainment, convention, gaming, and 
hotel facilities. The first class resort in Macau will 
be supported by a first class ferry service delivering 
visitors and guests to their destinations on The Cotai 
Strip.
The vessels have a length waterline of 43.8m, a 
moulded hull depth of 3.8m, a beam of 11.8m, a 
draught of 1.6m, and a deadweight of 70dwt. 
Powered by four MTU 16 cylinder 4000 series diesel 
engines, each producing 2320kW at 2000rev/min, 
driving a Rolls-Royce/Kamewa waterjet propulsion 
system, each ferry is additionally fitted with transom 
mounted SeaState Interceptors providing an active 
high-speed ride control system for maximum passenger 
comfort. The vessel has been equipped with four 
Reintjes VLJ 930 gearboxes.
The vessels are being built in accordance with the 
requirements and under the survey of Det Norske 
Veritas, conforming to the International Maritime 
Organization High Speed Craft code (HSC 2000) in 
conjunction with the Hong Kong Marine Department 
requirements for high-speed ferries.
The new ferries will add a dedicated transport link 
to supply The Cotai Strip, and have been finished in 
exciting electric blue, with a fountain flowing with gold 
and sparkling stars.
In addition to the 411 passengers carried by each 
ferry on two decks, special cranage and storage for 
passengers’ luggage is also included. The cabin areas 
include Beurteaux Club and Executive seats with 
leather finish, accompanied by aircraft style overhead 
lockers to provide a carry-on baggage capacity. 
Combined with electronic ticketing and onboard hotel 
check-in, the intention is for the new ferries to provide 
a seamless final connection for The Cotai Strip’s guests 
and visitors.

I
n summer 2007, Thor, a new Z-Tech 7500 class tug, 
was delivered to its owners, Suderman & Young 
Towing Co, of Texas. Thor is the first of this new class 
of powerful ship-handling/escort tugs developed by 
Robert Allan Ltd, and builds on the international 
success of its smaller cousin, the now well-known 
Z-Tech 6000 class, which since their introduction 
to the world market barely four years ago, are now 
operating throughout South East Asia, Australia, the 
Middle East, and in the Panama Canal. This delivery 
marks the first Z-Tech tug of any class built in North 
America.
Thor, and its soon to be delivered sister tug, is 
classed for both harbour and coastal towing and 
tanker escort duty, and will be used in the port of 
Houston. 
The tugs were built to American Bureau of Shipping 
class notation: +A1 Towing Service, +AMS, Escort, 
Fi-Fi1 by Main Iron Works of Houma, Louisiana. 
Another set of three tugs of the Z-Tech 7500 class 
have also recently been contracted with Orange 
Shipyards of Orange Texas, a division of Conrad 
Industries Inc for delivery in 2008 and 2009.
The vessel has a length overall of 30m, a beam 
of 12.0m, a depth of 5.0m, and a draught of 5.18m. 
Propulsion comprises a pair of Caterpillar 3516B 
diesel engines, each rated 2348kW at 1800rev/min, 
and each driving a Schottel model SRP 1520 Z-
drive with a 2700mm diameter propeller through a 
hollow, in-line shafting system. This combination 
delivers a bollard pull of 75tonnes ahead, 70+tonnes 
astern, and provides a free running speed in excess 
of 13knots.
The Z-Tech 7500 class tugs are outfitted for a crew 
of six persons, in modern and well-equipped facilities 
with a ‘down-home’ touch to the decor provided by 
the shipyard.
The main hawser winch is a double drum, model 
DYSF-52 hydraulic winch supplied by Markey 
Machinery, of Seattle. The winch has a line capacity 
of 228m of 80mm diameter synthetic line, a brake 
capacity of 250tonnes, and a line pull of 9070kg at a 
speed of 38m/min or 4300kg at 76m/min.
Electrical power is provided by a pair of John Deere 
6081AFM75 gensets, each rated at 195kW.
The tug has a full Fi-Fi1 rating in accordance with 
class notation requirements. The two fire pumps are 
driven by an independent fire pump engine.

A 
new aluminium pilot boat, Tiger, built for 
North Western Shipping & Towage by Sabre 
Engineering, both Tasmanian companies, was 
commissioned for pilot and ambulance duties in and 
around the Port of Portland. The boat was designed 
by Michael Hunn Marine, another local business.
The vessel has an overall length of 11.9m, enabling it 
to be operated by a coxswain, ideal for regional ports; 
it has a 4.1m beam; and a deadrise of 18degs.
Power is delivered by twin 350bhp Cummins 
QSB5.9 electronic diesel engines without gearboxes, 
coupled to Ultrajet UJ305 waterjets, giving Tiger a very 
respectable 26knot service speed (fully loaded), and a 
maximum speed of 33knots at 2800rev/min. Vessel 
control at high-speed and when manoeuvring is via a 
two-station Ultra Joystick system. 
Waterjets were chosen rather than conventional 
propellers because of their outstanding manoeuvra-
bility, simplicity of installation, and safety in the event 
of retrieving a man overboard (MOB). Tiger has been 
fitted with both manual hydraulic steering and an 
electro-hydraulic UltraJet joystick control system.
This simplifies close quarters manoeuvring and 
allows continuous operation in the event of a failure 
in either system. A remote joystick allows the 
coxswain to control the vessel from the after deck 
during any MOB recovery.
As the operation of a pilot boat requires what is 
in effect a controlled collision with a large object 
(a ship), the structure of Tiger has been designed 
with this fully in mind. A wide horizontal web 
frame runs around the perimeter of the hull, which 
together with the deck, and the transverse bulkheads, 
provides extreme strengthening in the region of 
major anticipated contact.
To cushion any anticipated encounters with large 
vessels, a large closed cell foam fender has been 
fitted to this stiffened area. The transom corners 
of 6mm plate are heavily rounded to absorb impact 
on breaking away from the vessel, and to add to the 
integral strength of the construction. The bottom 
plating consists of 8mm marine grade aluminium, 
and the transverse bulkheads are of 3mm corrugated 
plate.
A full electronics package was provided and fitted 
by Island Marine including VHF, Garmin GPS/
plotter, and a Garmin Sounder. Sonar ports have 
been fitted to allow the vessel to participate in 
hydrographic survey work if required. In addition, a 
Cummins Smartcraft electronic management system 
has been fitted.
The accommodation fit-out is bright and highly 
functional, with hydraulic suspension seats for 
crew and pilots, and with a small galley in the 
wheelhouse. The wheelhouse has good visibility 
with everything within reach to the coxswain and 
accessible electronics. 
Built under Tasmania’s Marine and Safety and 
Survey requirements, other features of the vessel 
include a flush deck, inboard hand rails, and safety 
harness rail, and access and stowage for a stretcher.

Pictured here is VB Rota, an identical sister.
E
ight azimuthing stern drive tugs, of 4200hp, 
have been built by Spanish shipyard Union 
Naval Valencia (UNV) as part of the UNV 352 SD 
series. Unusually, the tugs have be fitted with all 
the necessary equipment needed for unrestricted 
navigation, and are part of a design originally created 
for harbour and coastal operations only. 
The six vessels already delivered are VB Tamaulipas 
and VB Sinaloa for CM del Pacífico, SA de CV (Mexico) 
in March 2005; VB Sonora for the same owner in May 
2005; VB Rota for Sertosa (Spain) in November 2006, 
VB Almeria for the same owner in January 2007; and 
VB Cádiz for Covaresa (Spain) in March 2007. The last 
two in the series, VB Jerez and VB Lanzarote were built 
for Sertosa and Rebalapa y Barcazas de Las Palmas, 
SA (Spain) respectively, and both were delivered in 
July 2007.
The tugs have a bollard pull of 53tonnes ahead, and 
48tonnes astern. The speed of the tugs at sea trials with 
a mean design draught of 3m was 12.15knots, with 
the main engines developing 100% of the maximum 
power.
The series was built and classified by Bureau Veritas 
to: I +Hull + Mach Tug +AUT-UMS Firefighting (E), 
and complies with Spanish administration rules.
The two four-stroke Caterpillar 3516B propulsion 
engines in each vessel have a continuous service power 
at 100% of 1566kW at 1600rev/min. In addition, two 
Schottel SRP 1212 CP azimuthing propellers have 
been fitted.
The electric current onboard is produced by two Volvo 
Penta generator sets comprising a four-stroke diesel 
engine at 1500rev/min and one electric alternator of 
100kVA, 400V-50Hz with all necessary accessories. The 
generator sets will be cooled by a ‘box-coolers’ system.
A great deal of anchoring and mooring equipment 
has been installed on the series. The manoeuvring of 
the anchor is carried out using an electric winch, from 
Ibercisa, which has a water/sand-tight motor. 
An Oelkes-Eichler, model 402, towing winch of 
approximately 52tonnes has been mounted close to 
the winch.  The hook is hydraulic, and manoeuvring is 
located locally and remotely from the bridge. The hook 
release system is made by three controls. In addition, 
one small auxiliary electric winch is fitted close to the 
hook to recover small diameter towing ropes.
One Ibercisa hydraulically-driven towing winch has 
been installed on the main deck forward. The winch 
has a brake holding capacity of 137.5tonnes, 5tonnes 
at 30m/minute, with 150m of towing rope and 80mm 
plus 20m of steel cable with 36mm. It also has a 
warping head for mooring. The winch has been fitted 
on reinforced seating.
Two hydraulic pumps, each with 100% of the 
required power, are driven by the propeller shaft in 
order to operate the winch. One of the hydraulic 
pumps acts as a spare.
As expected, there is also a plethora of lifesaving 
equipment on this tug series. Two RFD pneumatic  
liferafts have been installed aft of the bridge, and a 
Zodiac inflatable, with an outboard engine of 25hp, 
is also carried. The tugs are also equipped with a 
centralised CO2 firefighting system in the engineroom, 
supplied by Semco Maritime.
Located on the main deck is a common mess room 
forward starboard side, a galley aft port side, a toilet 
with shower, wash basin, and wc, port side and a 
corridor with access to the engineroom, accommodation 
forward below deck, and the wheelhouse. Under the 
main deck is the accommodation area comprising 
of one single cabin and three double cabins, and 
these have been designed with comfort in mind. The 
increased crew capacity in comparison with the original 
Ramparts 2400 design was a key issue for unrestricted 
operations.

shelves. 
The innovative design of the vessels has been focused 
on simplicity, functionality, and crew comfort. The 
result is claimed to be a completely new concept.
The rescue zone and fast rescue crafts are located 
amidships and the wheelhouse is situated just aft of 
the rescue zone, resulting in an optimal view from the 
control stations in the bridge wings.
VOS Tracker has a length of 48m, a beam of 11m, 
and a depth of 5.50m. She has been classified by 
Lloyd’s Register to: + 100 A1, + LMC, UMS, and also 
complies with UKOOA, NMD, DMA, and Nogepa 
regulations. 
The propulsion system consists of one ABC 6DZC 
1325kW main engine, driving a FP propeller through a 
reverse reduction gearbox. A diesel-electric system for 
a 300kW retractable azimuth bow thruster is provided 
as a secondary propulsion system and for standby 
operations. The vessel can reach speeds of nearly 
14knots, and has an impressive range of 5000nm or 
40 days. 
This propulsion concept is optimised for fuel 
consumption by enabling one generator set to take the 
full hotel load and restricted bow thruster load, with 
still sufficient capacity for station-keeping in standby 
operations in fair to moderate weather conditions. 
The crew accommodation, for 12 plus four spare, 
is located aft of the rescue zone for optimal comfort 
in seaway. The fore ship is fully dedicated to the 
survivors and is clearly separated from the crew 
accommodation. 
The vessel has a total capacity for 125 survivors with 
a reception area, a 20m² treatment room, a recovery 
area with 20 bunks, a survivor area with 105 seats, as 
well as sanitary facilities. There is also a morgue with 
a capacity for 12. 
Rescue equipment includes one knuckle boom crane 
with an SWL of 2.7tonnes at 12.85m, two SOLAS-
approved 15-person fast rescue craft, as well as a 
climbing net and a Dacon scoop.

I
n December 2005, the German shipyard Fassmer 
received an order for the construction of a seagoing 
24m bearing and measurement vessel. This craft was 
to be a modified rebuilding of the bearing ship 
Baltic, which was supplied to the Hamburg Water and 
Shipping Office, Stralsund, in 2002. The vessel, yard 
number 2070, delivered in March 2007, is now used 
in Wedel, and is also called Wedel. 
The 1.54m-draught vessel has been built to allow 
monitoring of the hydrographic bottom with traffic 
safety bearings, and has bearings for the inspection 
of the construction works. In addition, the vessel 
will be engaged in shipping-lane cross-bearings up to 
the shipping lane edge, with a speed of greater than 
6knots. 
Here, good manoeuvrability and good course stability 
are necessary, also in the case of shorter journeys. 
In this case, base contacts of the ship hull are usual, 
thus hull, rudder, and drive bodies are to be protected 
correspondingly.
The vessel was constructed from normal-strength 
shipbuilding steel in combined longitudinal and frame 
rib design. The wheelhouse is made from aluminium, 
and TBT-free anti-fouling was used throughout the 
vessel. Classification was carried out by Germanischer 
Lloyd to: + 100 AS K + MC-AUT.
Wedel has been installed with two MTU engines with 
power of 331kW at 1880rev/min. The boat has also 
been fitted with a ZF 1900 reduction gear; creep-drive 
equipment with electrical gear actuation; and two four-
bladed propellers with a diameter of 1000mm, ensuring 
the boat can reach speeds of greater than 12knots.  
Redundancy has been secured in accordance with 
class specification, through the two main engines and 
their independent supply. Ecologically-friendly oils 
have been used where possible, for example in the stern 
tube. In addition, a rudder heel, for the protection of 
the rudder blades, has been installed. 
The vessel has a capacity for three persons and there 
is a centrally arranged stairwell that connects the 
aluminium wheelhouse, the equipment deck, and the 
machinery room. The free working deck has an area 
of approximately 45m2. A sounder balcony is located in 
the foredeck area.
Equipment installed on the bearing ship includes 
one RR 4.2 standby support boat from Fassmer; one 
davit/working crane; one Steen anchor winch; and one 
MKG crane. Wedel has an optimal arrangement of the 
sonic depth-finder oscillators.

X
plorer, launched in Spring 2007, is the first of 
the new Wave Commander class of offshore 
support boats from Alnmaritec Ltd. She is 
a powerful vessel designed to be used primarily as 
a wind farm support vessel, although she is equally 
adept in surveying or dive support roles. Alnmaritec 
has now begun building a second in class vessel, for 
delivery in 2008.
Her new asymmetric catamaran hull form is a 
development of the successful ‘Wave Train’ hull 
shape which has been well proven in service on 
Alnmaritec vessels all over the world, but this new 
form has a higher wet deck, sloped inner hull plates, 
and an outboard planing chine to specifically improve 
performance in heavy weather.  
The new hull has been extensively tested in the 
model towing tank at Newcastle University, in the 
UK, to analyse and optimise performance for both 
resistance and sea-keeping. As a result she has a 
top speed of over 22knots with twin 490bhp QSC 
Cummins diesels driving Hamilton 362 waterjets, and 
she has proved herself to have excellent sea-keeping 
properties. 
Alnmaritec has been in the vanguard of the 
development of wind farm support boats in 
conjunction with Xplorer’s owners North Sea Logistics 
over the past seven years, with six such vessels built 
during that period, and the boat’s arrangement 
reflects the culmination of this development. 
She has a fully raised forecastle deck with clear all 
round access and direct view from the helm station to 
the transfer platform in order to facilitate personnel 
transfer, and her increased beam enhances her 
stability to allow for safe transfer operations, even 
under difficult conditions. 
The large aft deck is configured to carry up to 
5tonnes of deck cargo and a hydraulic crane is 
offered as an option. With her powerful twin waterjet 
configuration she is highly manoeuvrable with a 
shallow draught making her extremely versatile. 
She carries a compliment of two crew members 
seated forward at the raised control console and 12 
passengers seated in comfort, around tables within the 
spacious deckhouse. The deckhouse also incorporates 
a galley and a WC, together with ample storage and 
a wet area. 
She is fitted with a Beta Marine 1305 diesel generator 
and a comprehensive array of electronic equipment 
including a satellite ‘man-finder’ tracking system, 
3D seabed profiling, radar, GPS, and chartplotter, 
together with a satcom communications suite. 
The boat is extremely robustly constructed from 
marine grade aluminium alloy to deal with the 
rigors of support operations. Protection is fitted 
on both keels forward and she has a substantial 
rubber fendering system at the bow to cope with the 
requirements of transfer operations. 
She has a foam fendering system around the 
remainder of the boat to help reduce weight, and the 
waterjets are protected by a substantial bump guard 
frame. Despite the strength of construction, the bare 
weight of the boat has been kept to around 17tonnes 
to help reduce fuel consumption, which plays a major 
part in running costs.
