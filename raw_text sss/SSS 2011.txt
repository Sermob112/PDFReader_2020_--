etal Shark’s 28 Defiant aluminium response boat 
made notable ripples in 2011, not only in terms of 
its design but as part of one of the more sizeable and 
significant US marine contracts of the year. 
The US Coast Guard (USCG) has taken the decision to 
replace its entire fleet of Response Boat-Small (RB-S) 
category vessels, thereby providing Louisiana-based craft 
builder Metal Shark Boats with an order for 470 vessels to 
the USCG fleet, and 20 to US Customs and Border 
Protection. The contract is estimated to be worth $US192 
million in total, and has been praised as a vital economic 
boost to Louisiana, with 40 new employees expected to 
join Metal Shark before May 2012. At least 40 of the new 
28 Defiant models ordered by the USCG are scheduled to 
be completed and delivered by the end of December 2012. 
The 28 Defiant platform boasts, among its many 
features, the ability to achieve a top speed of 40knots, with 
a minimum range of 150 nautical miles. This vessel class 
meets all Port Security Grant requirements, and the 
USCG has deemed it suitable for port and waterway 
enforcement, search and rescue operations, interception of 
drug-carrying vessels and illegal immigrants, environmental 
regulation and other law enforcement missions. 
With a dry weight of approximately 4455kg and a fuel 
capacity of 500litres (stored within a baffled aluminium 
fuel tank), the vessel is road transportable, for flexibility 
and swift service between missions. 
Thanks to her folding cabin design, another legacy from 
Metal Shark’s Defiant platform, 28 Defiant can also be 
transported via Hercules C130 aircraft, aboard a specialised 
trailer unit. 
One of 28 Defiant's most notable and useful features is 
the adaptable nature of its pilothouse arrangement. This 
section of the vessel features full-drop cabin windows that 
convert the craft from a closed, climate-controlled 
pilothouse boat to an open boat, and vice versa, within 
seconds. According to requirements, the crew can, 
therefore, drop the windows down when they wish to 
improve ventilation and communication, or raise them 
again to protect themselves from attackers and / or the 
elements. 
The cabin is enhanced with anti-ballistic materials, for 
added protection. Additionally, 28 Defiant features five 
shock-mitigated seats; four inside the pilothouse and the 
bow gunner seat, these being in addition to an aft gunner 
sling seat. Other considerations include non-skid decks 
and gunnels, an integrated urethane sheath-wrapped foam 
fendering system, a quad battery system and two 
9,100litres per hour bilge pumps with automatic and 
manual control options.

P
atrolling coastal waters on frequent and lengthy 
missions often necessitates overnight shifts for hard-
working and long-suffering crew. Over the past few 
years, Europe has witnessed an increasing number of 
calls for a higher degree of ergonomic consideration 
when it comes to patrol boat design, amid fears that 
excessive onboard noise and vibrations could be adding 
to the fatigue levels of crew members, and leading to 
subsequent poor performance. 
Narrowly missing out on last year’s compendium of 
Significant Small Ships by dint of her late 2010 delivery 
date, the 26m Banrion Uladh represents a firm step 
towards tackling noise and vibration by limiting onboard 
noise levels to an impressive 56dB. The aluminium vessel, 
designed and constructed by Estonia-based Baltic 
Workboats, was modelled partly on the builder’s previous 
24m Baltic 2400 platform, which was previously deployed 
to fashion fast craft for research and border patrol vessels 
operating in Polish, Estonian and Latvian waters. 
Although issues centering on crew comfort have to date 
been voiced predominantly in Europe, there is no reason 
to doubt that, as patrol vessel deliveries continue in 
regions such as Russia, South East Asia and the Middle 
East, demand for similar ergonomically friendly designs 
will also grow globally, making the Banrion Uladh a fine 
example for what can be achieved with a little forethought 
and design acumen. 
Banrion Uladh was built at the behest of Northern 
Ireland’s Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development (DARD),  to the tune of approximately 
US$3.65 million, chiefly to replace retiring fisheries patrol 
craft Ken Vickers.  Subsequently, the project attracted a 
50% contribution from the EU. Originally, DARD 
requested a vessel capable of achieving a top speed of 
22knots, though Baltic Workboats was able to boost this 
rating over the course of her construction, registering 
26.5knots in her initial sea trials, courtesy of twin MTU 
10V2000 M72 diesel engines. In order to combine this 
performance with an ergonomically sound environment, 
Baltic Workboats incorporated a flexible-mounted 
wheelhouse, complete with rubber pads, into Banrion 
Uladh’s layout, and added special sound-dampening 
mats to her interior fittings, resulting in the vessel’s low 
dB rating. 
The vessel’s wheelhouse has been split into two distinct 
sections; the first, at the aft end, houses a wet laboratory, 
featuring three workstations, which is intended for 
scientific and data-gathering activities; the second, located 
forward, contains an air-conditioned navigation bridge for 
up to three crew members, plus additional seats for two 
observers, and a full size chart table, boasting an electronics 
suite. With scientific surveys in mind, the vessel has also 
been equipped with a dismountable multibeam echo 
sounder and a pot hauler davit on her port side. 
The craft’s aft deck also features a 44.7kW Boomeranger 
rigid inflatable boat (RIB), capable of hitting speeds of up 
to 35knots, and Banrion Uladh enjoys a top fuel capacity 
of 6000litres. All in all, this is a compact and self-sufficient 
little vessel that’s certainly thrown down the gauntlet to 
designers seeking to eliminate noise levels whilst retaining 
adequate service speed and fast response times. We can 
certainly picture a few Russian border authorities who’d be 
keen on trialling this comfortable solution.

ased on Rolls-Royce Marine’s Ulstein UT 755 
design, a popular supply ship blueprint since its 
inception in 1996, the 73.6m loa platform supply vessel 
Caspian Provider, which was delivered to Dubai-based 
Topaz Energy and Marine, represents a new spin on the 
proven concept. 
Caspian Provider mainly differs from the typical UT 755 
layout by virtue of an additional accommodation deck, 
expanding the vessel’s complement capacity to 
accommodate 40 persons onboard. In addition, the vessel 
incorporates a covered forecastle forward and a bulbous 
bow, for a visibly updated appearance. In total, Caspian 
Provider boasts capacity for 545m
3 of fuel oil cargo; 
1090m
3 of fresh water; 1485m
3 of ballast / drill water; 
993m
3 of mud (596m
3 of which is included in the water 
ballast capacity); and 320m
3 of dry bulk.  
The vessel is divided into watertight compartments 
and features a double hull, while the steering gear room 
features rotary vane-type Rolls-Royce Tenfjord SR622-
FCP steering gears, turning  Rolls-Royce Ulstein Hinze 
FB-S 1750 rudders, as well as the hydraulic power unit 
for the two capstans on the main deck above. Below and 
forward of the steering gear room is the aft thruster 
room, where the Rolls-Royce–supplied Kamewa Ulstein 
transverse thrusters are located, as is the emergency fire 
pump. 
Further forward, through a watertight sliding door, the 
pump/gear room features the vessel’s Kamewa Ulstein 
600AGSC-V-KP50L propulsion gear boxes, which drive 
Kamewa Ulstein 2900mm-diameter, four-blade 
propellers, running at 197rpm. The ballast and fresh water 
cargo pumps are also situated in this area, with fresh water 
tanks above. 
Caspian Provider has been equipped with a water mist 
fire-fighting system, protecting the exposed parts of the 
engines, separators and boilers. The system is automatically 
activated upon the heat rising and hitting a pre-
determined temperature.  
An engine room workshop is situated on tween deck, 
forward of the main engines. Aft on main deck are two 
capstans, used for mooring the vessel. The cargo deck is 
protected at each side by a cargo rail, just outside of 
which are the vessel’s loading stations, with the 
connection points for the liquid cargo and bulk hoses, 
midships and aft. 
Special attention has also been paid to bridge visibility, 
and Caspian Provider is also fitted out with a dynamic 
positioning system of the ICON DP2 range, designed by 
Rolls-Royce. For added manoeuvrability, the vessel 
incorporates Rolls-Royce’s PosCon joystick system, while 
Furuno has supplied the majority of her navigation and 
communication equipment in the wheelhouse. 
Forward on the A-deck is the windlass/mooring winch, 
in a covered area, alongside an emergency access route 
from the forecastle deck. The B-deck has, in addition to 
the vessel exhaust uptakes and air duct to the engine room 
on port side, four one-man and six two-men cabins, while 
the C-deck features four one-man officer cabins, as well as 
the instrument room.

O
dd as it may seem, until 2011 the Chicago Fire 
Department, US,  relied solely on a 1949-built 
fireboat, Victor L. Schlaeger, to patrol the Chicago 
River, Lake Michigan and the surrounding harbours 
within the vicinity of the Windy City. The department 
has now revamped its fire-fighting capacity with the 
delivery of the Robert Allan-designed Christopher 
Wheatley, constructed to the Canadian designer’s 
RAnger 2700 class concept, which made its debut in 
April 2011. The vessel was named to commemorate 
Christopher Wheatley, a firefighter who lost his life in 
the course of duty in 2010. 
The 27.4m fireboat has been credited with Ice Class 
ABS C-0 notation, in recognition of the harsh winter 
environments she is set to face in the Midwest during 
her year-round operations, and she boasts the capacity 
to carry just over 15,700litres of fuel oil, 946litres of 
potable water and 3785litres of fire-fighting foam. 
According to Robert Allan, special technical attention 
was paid to balancing Christopher Wheatley’s shallow 
operating draught and low maximum air draught, to 
ensure that she remained light enough to evade the river 
bottom in shallow waters, though not so light as to 
make contact with the low height bridges that are a 
common feature of the Chicago River, particularly 
where it runs through Chicago’s downtown district. In 
sea trials, the vessel was demonstrated to have a bollard 
pull rating of 30tonnes. 
The vessel’s propulsion machinery comprises two 
CAT 32 high-speed diesel engines, each driving a fixed-
pitch, 1371mm diameter propeller through a ZF model 
W4610 reverse-reduction gearbox. Two other, 
independent CAT 32 diesel engines, each rated 745kW 
at 1800rpm,  power the vessel’s fire-fighting FFS model 
SFP250 x 230 fire pump, which is rated 1590m
3 per 
hour, at a pressure of 10bar. Christopher Wheatley 
features four Stang fire-fighting monitors; one 
positioned centre forward, rated 22,710litres per 
minute; two port and starboard forward, each rated 
11,355litres per minute; and one aft, also rated 
11,355litres per minute. The aft monitor is located on 
top of a hydraulically elevating mast, which raises the 
monitor to a maximum height of 9.14m above the 
water. 
Functioning as a ‘day boat’, Christopher Wheatley 
features no crew living spaces, but the fireboat contains 
a below-decks emergency treatment space, a 
decontamination shower room, galley and mess areas 
and two equipment storage spaces – the first capable of 
storing 28 Aero Marine life rafts and 150 lifejackets, the 
second housing scuba gear. In addition, the wheelhouse 
was carefully designed to provide the best visibility 
possible. While the memory of Christopher Wheatley 
lives on through his rivergoing namesake, this sturdy 
fireboat is providing the Chicago Fire Department with 
a safe, modernised tool for tackling blazes and hazmat-
associated risks, and for saving lives in a timely manner.

Y
ou couldn’t get away from offshore wind farm 
support (OWS) vessels this year; this burgeoning 
industry is becoming one of the small vessel sector’s 
modern success stories, and looks set to continue over 
the next three years at least. However, designer and 
builder CTruks Boats caught Significant Small Ships’ 
eye in 2011 with the launch of CWind Alliance, 
which, alongside her prototype Asherah, has challenged 
the concept of the OWS vessel as a mere means of 
transferring wind turbine farm technicians from shore 
to the facilities. 
The vessel, constructed by the Essex, UK-based 
builder for sister operator CWind for deployment on 
the London Array – the UK’s largest offshore wind 
turbine farm _ goes beyond the usual A-Z remit 
expected of OWS boats, by incorporating a patented, 
flexible pod system, enabling the operator to change the 
vessel’s layout within a matter of hours, should demand 
for a different type of operational activity arise. 
For instance, the operator can relocate the 
wheelhouse from the front of the vessel to the back, 
enabling them to adapt the boat type to transport 
personnel or alternatively carry stocks of fuel and 
generators out to the wind farms, as required. The 
pods can easily be detached by crane, and also open up 
the vessel concept to a wide range of different charter 
options. This latter bonus is particularly notable when 
one considers the volatility of many previously stable 
small shipping markets at present, and in what it can 
offer to operators in terms of additional revenue, 
should the OWS vessel be hired out for survey and 
research activities, for example. 
Clients are also able to request refuelling pods, some 
boasting capacities of up to 16,000litres; a pressure 
washing pod; and a survey pod. In addition, with 
personnel safety in mind, CTruk Boats has provided 
CWind Alliance with an amphibious rescue pod, which 
can be launched from the vessel to rescue injured 
technicians, some of whom may have become trapped in 
wind turbines built on sand banks. This attention to the 
shallow draught environments frequently encountered by 
OWS vessels also led to CTruk Boats selecting Rolls-
Royce water jets in preference to propellers, meaning that 
CWind Alliance is well equipped to negotiate areas close to 
sand banks, and zones which may contain quantities of 
debris, capable of putting an untimely end to propellers. A 
spokesperson for CTruk Boats told Significant Small Ships: 
“In addition, the Rolls-Royce Vector Stick controls are 
designed to be intuitive, making it easy for the skipper to 
use, even when [he is] being bombarded with other 
information whilst docking at the turbine.”
Hard-working vessels of this nature have traditionally 
relied on heavy doors, although CTruk Boats chose to 
incorporate a resin infusion technique on the doors of 
CWind Alliance, resulting in a reported 65% decrease in 
door weight. The builder has also developed a 
manufacturing process that enables modular construction, 
in order to increase production efficiency. CWind 
Alliance’s hull composites have been designed to produce 
a smoother, more hydrodynamic overall shape. The end 
result of this process is that CWind Alliance has been able 
to halve its fuel consumption rate, compared to traditional 
aluminium workboats within this size bracket.

E
lastec 1 represents the first of a duo of oil 
pollution 
control 
boats, 
designed 
and 
constructed by UK boatbuilder Alnmaritec, for 
delivery to Chinese oil major PetroChina. The 
latter group has deployed Elastec1 and her sister 
vessel, Elastec2, at its refinery terminal in Tianjin, 
China, with the goal of keeping the area as 
environmentally friendly as possible, enabling the 
company to act fast to clear up any spills or leaks in 
the vicinity, as well as ensuring that the surrounding 
waters are kept clear of floating garbage. 
Comprising a 10.8m x 5.2m catamaran, Elastec1 
formed Alnmaritec’s new Wave Skimmer class, an 
upgrade of the designer’s previous Wave Provider 
concept, which had originally been drawn up in 
2010, also for delivery and deployment to 
PetroChina. Upon structural completion at 
Alnmaritec’s yard in Blyth, UK, Elastec1 and her 
sister were transported to the US, where Elastec 
American Marine, a manufacturer of specialist oil 
recovery and storage equipment, kitted out the pair. 
The Wave Skimmer family is equipped with a 
hydraulically operated debris scoop, located at the 
vessel’s bow, which is responsible for gathering floating 
junk. This recovered waste is then stored in an onboard 
skip, which can handle a capacity of up to 2m
3, for safe 
disposal at a later stage. The skip has been designed to 
be removed when not needed, meaning that Elastec1’s 
two-man crew can detach the unit and create more 
space for additional cargo and equipment, depending 
on operational requirements. 
Another interesting feature is the presence of four 
proprietary dynamic oil collection bladders. These 
chambers, situated within each catamaran’s double hull, 
enable Elastec1 and her sister to perform oil skimming 
duties, and each chamber boasts the capacity to store 
some 5m
3 worth of recovered oil. 
An opening is arranged in each inner hull plate 
leading directly to a circus chamber, from which oil can 
be skimmed, by either weir or drum skimmers, and 
hydraulically operated collection boards, fitted to the 
inner hull plates, subsequently guide the oily water to 
the opening of the circus chamber, when set in ‘open’ 
position. The oil is then transferred to the bladders, 
arranged forward of the circus chamber compartment, 
while clean water is pumped back out of the vessel. 
Elastec1’s propulsion package comprises two inboard 
Betamarine diesel engines, each rated at just over 66kW, 
which drive a pair of Hamilton 213 waterjets. As well as 
enabling the boats to respond to clean-up operations in 
a swift and versatile manner, this propulsive arrangement 
provides a shallow draught for each control boat, 
meaning that the Wave Skimmers are capable of 
operating in confined, tight or awkward waters – for 
instance, in close proximity to beaches and ramps – 
thereby providing them with greater scope to act on and 
rectify oil spills and build-ups of junk before the 
problem escalates. The boats can also be used to deploy 
pollution control boom and similar equipment, and can 
dry out if required. 
All in all, Elastec1 represents a welcome international 
order for the deployment of a simple and compact, yet 
potentially far-reaching, floating oil response and 
recovery solution.

A
sian shipyards have continued to enjoy a winning 
streak of small vessel orders, and the delivery of 
Guan Xiao Er Hao to the Dongguan Fire Services 
Department, China, in November 2011 shows that 
innovation also remains a premium for builders within 
this territory. 
Co-designed by Canada’s Robert Allan and Hong 
Kong’s Wang Tak Engineering & Shipbuilding, the 
46.4m RAnger 4600 class fireboat is a twin-screw, 
diesel-powered craft which was tailor-made for the 
Dongguan Fire Services Department, especially 
focusing on functions such as offshore rescue, shore-
side fire-fighting and initial salvage response in the 
Pearl River Estuary, the Pearl River and the network of 
harbours situated in the Dongguan region. 
Guan Xiao Er Hao boasts capacities of 110m
3 for fuel 
oil, 24m
3 for potable water and 40m
3 for water ballast. A 
pair of Caterpillar C18 diesel engines each drive a 2m 
diameter fixed-pitch propeller, while the vessel’s electrical 
power is provided courtesy of a a pair of Caterpillar C18 
DITA diesel gensets, rated at 350kW apiece. 
The fireboat’s wheelhouse has been set forward, for 
increased visibility, comes with overhead viewing windows 
and houses a command centre, complete with a chart 
table, enabling the crew to coordinate activities in the 
event of an emergency. 
An onboard rescue area contains seating for up to 40 
recovered persons, plus 10 stretcher stations, and an 
onboard hospital unit provides two patient beds. 
The vessel’s fire-fighting equipment was provided by 
long-term Robert Allan supplier Fire Fighting Systems of 
Mosse, Norway, and this combined package meets the 
international Fi-Fi 2 standard. This combination includes 
three FFS 500/400-80 fire pumps, rated at 3600m
3 per 
hour, as well an array of fire monitors: two FFS 2400/600 
models, with water and foam output capacities of 2400m
3 
per hour and 600m
3 per hour respectively; two FFS 
600/150 monitors, with water and foam output capacities 
of 600m
3 per hour and 150m
3 per hour respectively; an 
FFS 3600 unit, with a  water capacity of 3600m
3 per 
hour; and two FFS 600 monitors with water capacity of 
600m
3 per hour. 
Wang Tak Engineering & Shipbuilding tells Significant 
Small Ships that all monitors can be remotely operated, 
and feature fully automated control. In the event of an 
emergency, crew can also revert to full manual control. 
The control system features a touch-screen control panel 
and mimic panel. 
The fire-fighting system also includes a water deluge 
system, incorporating FFS nozzles, two foam injection 
pumps, six foam proportioners and 14  80mm deckheads 
for water/foam delivery, alongside two 300mm outlets for 
delivery to landside. In total, Guan Xiao Er Hao has a 
foam capacity of 60tonnes – making her a valuable asset 
for safeguarding against fires and similar hazards in this 
stretch of China.

T
here has been a great deal of talk this year about 
harnessing renewable fuel sources to power small 
vessels, with the marine industry projecting a mixture 
of optimism and studious cynicism concerning the 
feasibility of such projects. On the one hand, alternative 
fuel modes are readily available and have been 
demonstrated on select vessels; on the other, critics 
claim, the high costs incurred by replacing traditional 
diesel-engine power render many potential designs 
unworkable. 
However, there’s no dodging the fact that the USA’s 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier III rules, 
which enter force in January 2012, coupled with the 
International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Tier III 
rules on emissions, scheduled for implementation in 
2016, have added a tremendous amount of pressure to 
the debate, and that alternative, low-emission 
solutions need to be adopted quickly.
So it was heartening this year to see US-based 
operator Hornblower Cruises & Events launch what 
may potentially be the first in a new series of eco-
friendly passenger ferries. Dubbed Hornblower Hybrid, 
the 51.2m ferry will shuttle up to 600 passengers on 
trips across New York Harbour, arranged by Statue 
Cruises, bringing the public to such national 
landmarks as the Statue of Liberty National 
Monument and Ellis Island, as well as providing 
evening cruises and charter for private or corporate 
functions. Most notably though, Hornblower Hybrid 
lives up to her name by drawing on a combination of 
solar, wind and diesel power to transit the area. 
The ferry has been fitted with hydrogen fuel cells, solar 
panels and wind turbines, with most power generated by 
a 32kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell, designed by 
Hydrogenics, which is capable of converting hydrogen 
into electricity, heat and distilled water. This electricity is 
then used to run an electric motor and charge 192 
onboard batteries. The Odyssey AGM batteries are 
capable of providing hundreds of kilowatt-hours of energy 
storage for both propulsion and shipboard systems, 
allowing the vessel to spend significant periods of time 
operating in zero-emissions mode. Indeed, it is 
Hornblower Cruises & Events’ aim to “eliminate 
[emissions] entirely during a cruising day”, according to 
the group’s chief executive officer, Terry MacRae. 
 Additionally, and serving as back-up to the batteries 
configuration, a combination 20kW solar panels 
(manufactured by SunPower Corporation) and two  5kW 
wind turbines (manufactured by Urban Green Energy) 
have the added clout to power and propel the vessel. 
Should Hornblower Hybrid require extra kick than the 
above combinations provide, she can ultimately fall back 
on twin Scania diesel engines, each rated at 521kW and 
compliant with EPA Tier II regulations, to cover this need. 
Overall, the vessel is capable of meeting a maximum speed 
of 12knots, although her standard cruising speeds are 
estimated to be more in the region of 6-7knots. Her hull 
coatings were provided by PPG Marine, primarily, 
according to Hornblower Cruises & Events, for their 
durability, equating to less volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) being released via frequent recoating operations. 
Of course, New York State does tend to obsess over its 
environmental credentials, and in this respect, Hornblower 
Hybrid’s internal design is also worthy of mention. Forbo 
Flooring Systems put together the ferry’s carpet, which 
contains post-consumer recycled materials and is 
compliant with Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design (LEED) stipulations. Aluminium wall coverings, 
provided by Arvinyl, and ceiling panels from Chicago 
Metallic have eliminated the need for wallpaper, glue or 
high VOC paints, while HVAC specialist Dometic was 
involved in supplying the vessel’s dynamic air handler 
arrangement, which, in combination with energy-efficient 
windows, has resulted in comfortable interior 
temperatures for passengers without guzzling vast 
quantities of energy. Additionally, recycled glass was used 
in fashioning the ferry’s counter tops. 
For sure, the hybrid model might not suit all vessel 
types, but by demonstrating that battery power need not 
impact negatively on successful commercial operations, 
and in providing the basis for complete elimination of 
daily emissions, Hornblower Hybrid ranks as one of our 
significant finds of 2011. Hornblower Cruises & Events 
has not confirmed whether or not a sister vessel is in the 
offing, but it is likely we could be hearing much more 
from this company in the next two to three years.

ith a range of 2000 nautical miles and a bollard 
pull of 60tonnes, the 50m anchor handling, tug 
supply (AHTS) vessel Ievoli Orange is equipped for 
anchor handling and long-range towage. Italian ship 
operator Marnavi Offshore Srl took delivery of the 
AHTS in January 2011 from Selah Shipyard, a 
Turkish shipbuilder based in Tuzla, Istanbul, as part of 
its plans to bolster its offshore fleet with high-
specification, up-to-date vessels.
Ievoli Orange has been designed to carry out a 
number of offshore roles; she is equipped to carry gas 
oil and fresh water, as well as up to 12TEU containers 
on deck – four of which can be refrigerated, to offshore 
units. As part of her comprehensive offshore support 
capabilities, Ievoli Orange is also designed to carry 
sewage mud and disinfected sewage on her return from 
offshore units. 
The vessel’s dedicated cargo tanks are of steel 
construction and subdivided into four pairs of tanks, 
one for each segregated product. Two cofferdams in 
cargo separate the sewage/sewage mud tanks from 
marine diesel oil (MDO)/heavy fuel oil (HFO) tanks. 
The vessel’s pump room compartment divides the 
sewage/sewage mud tanks from fresh water tanks.
Deck equipment onboard the ship includes an 
electro-hydraulic crane for moving the cargo hoses, 
one towing winch with double drum, one rescue boat 
with regulatory davit and a windlass with drum for a 
high-holding power (HHP) anchor. 
The bulbous-bow, transom-stern vessel is arranged with 
a continuous double bottom, twin-nozzled controllable-
pitch propeller, twin rudders, bow thrusters and a fore 
engine room housing two Wärtsilä 9L20 main engines, 
each producing 1800kW. The vessel’s total power confers 
a service speed of around 12.5knots.
The AHTS has been installed with FiFi monitors 
situated above wheelhouse and is equipped for FiFi-1 
service and with nozzles along hull/superstructures for 
water spray (self protection).
Designed especially for operations in the Mediterranean, 
Black and Caspian Seas, Ievoli Orange is reinforced for 
navigation in brash ice in accordance with Ice Class 1A of 
Baltic Rules. She has also achieved Green Star notation, 
awarded by Italian classification RINa SpA.
For the comfort of the vessel’s 16 crew members, Ievoli 
Orange is equipped with a chilled water type air 
conditioning system.

A
s an all-aluminium construction, capable of 
achieving an eye-watering top speed of 50knots, 
the Dockstavarvet-designed and built, 17.2m 
Interceptor 16 M class patrol boat really pushed the 
envelope in 2011. Loosely based on the Sweden-based 
yard’s previous Combat Boat 90 H model, which has 
shifted approximately 250 units worldwide, the 
Interceptor 16 M was primarily developed to combine 
a high-speed solution, for coastal police forces to 
combat crime with rapid response, with a compact 
vessel arrangement providing basic accommodation 
for a small, four-man crew. 
The prototype version of this new model, the 
Enforcer II, was originally unveiled at the UK Seawork 
exhibition in 2002, which led to 35 units being ordered 
by police and coast guard authorities spanning Mexico 
to Malaysia. In turn, the Interceptor 16 M has been 
designed, built and equipped according to UK class 
society Lloyd’s Register’s Special Service Craft Rules for 
Area G3. This latter parameter is defined as comprising 
150 nautical miles (nm) from shelter. 
The patrol boat’s hull has been reinforced to go 
beyond class requirements when it comes to landing 
operations via the bow ramp, and this factor, combined 
with a lightweight of less than 20tonnes, has granted the 
Interceptor 16 M the ability to lower its fuel 
consumption rate to 7 litres per nm, when operating at 
a cruising speed of 40knots. 
Twin MAN D2842LE416 engines provide a 
combined power output of just over 1600kW, while the 
boat is fully operational on a 24V DC feed courtesy of 
two 120A alternators, running off the main engines to 
separate battery banks for service and starters. The vessel 
is also equipped with a 230V AC system for the crew’s 
domestic requirements, including an air conditioning 
system supplied by Climma, and this latter system can 
be fed either by shore power while the vessel is docked, 
or via an 11kW Onan diesel generator. 
The aft position of the Interceptor 16 M’s wheelhouse 
was so situated in order to provide enhanced visibility for 
the crew, especially when operating at high speed. 
Although modest, the boat’s accommodation area 
includes comfortable seating arrangements for up to four 
persons, and is laid out with one double and two single 
cabins, a mess room, pantry and toilet replete with 
shower. Should a boarding party need to access the vessel, 
or suspects be detained, the crew can accommodate these 
extra people with seating below deck. In addition, a 3.4m 
combined rigid inflatable boat / jetski can be stowed in a 
launch ramp on the aft deck. 
And it would appear that Dockstavarvet may be 
gearing up to produce even more significant patrol craft 
in the future, with the builder having commenced 
development of a new Interceptor 19 M class, providing 
accommodation for a larger crew and offering a longer 
range while maintaining its enviable top speed.

D
emand for specialised, custom-built vessels 
continues to fuel the majority of European 
shipyard orders. Ireland-based Safehaven Marine has 
been no stranger to this demand, having secured, in 
2011, a contract to supply four pilot boats for 
operations in the Azores Islands, situated some 1000 
miles out into the North Atlantic Ocean, between 
Europe and the US. 
Designed and constructed on the same platform as 
Safehaven’s Genesis Interceptor hull concept, the first of 
this quartet, Joa Vaz Corte-Real, was delivered in December 
2011, alongside sister vessel Alvaro de Ornelas. Built to 
meet the stipulations of the Portuguese Maritime 
Authority, with hull construction conducted under 
Bureau Veritas survey, Joa Vaz Corte-Real and her sisters 
have been / are being built to the specifications of 
Safehaven’s own Self Righting Interceptor 38 Pilot / 
Search And Rescue class, which was developed especially 
to cope with operations in the harshest of environments, 
and granting the vessels the ability to recover from an 
180deg roll over, even in tempestuous conditions. Prior to 
delivery, sea trials were conducted off the coast of Ireland, 
in Force 9 and up to 5m seas. 
Safehaven is particularly keen to market the Interceptor 
38 class to operators in smaller ports, especially those 
looking to source compact, multi-purpose vessels for a 
range of tasks. Joa Vaz Corte-Real draws her power from a 
pair of Volvo D9 engines, each rated at 312.6kW, run 
through twin ZF ‘V’ drive gearboxes. This configuration 
grants the vessels in the Interceptor 38 Pilot class a top 
speed of 25knots, operational speeds in excess of 22knots 
and a subsequent bollard pull of 4.6tonnes. The vessel’s 
cabins are situated relatively centrally, allowing for an aft 
cockpit equipped with a Mampaey quick-release towing 
slip hook. With crew safety in mind, Safehaven has ringed 
the pilot boat’s transom with a 60mm diameter guard rail, 
to protect those engaged on the deck, and her design also 
incorporates what Safehaven describes as a ‘pusher’ bow, 
enabling her to additionally undertake tug-style duties for 
smaller port craft, if so required. 
The vessel’s main accommodation arrangement 
comprises four pilot seats, designed in staggered height 
configuration for enhanced pilot visibility, while Joa Vaz 
Corte-Real’s central helm position is intended to grant the 
helmsman a greater degree of control and flexibility when 
attempting to board to port or starboard. The vessel also 
features a forward cabin, with a separate heads 
compartment, sleeping berths and storage lockers.
The boat’s engine room can be accessed from two 
onboard points: the first, via a deck hatch situated in the 
forward cabin, primarily installed to enable crew to enter 
the engine room to conduct daily inspections and / or 
maintenance checks; the second, via two large bolted deck 
hatches in the aft cockpit. This latter access point is 
intended soley for engine removal and service. 
At time of writing, both Joa Vaz Corte-Real and her sister 
Interceptor 38, Alvaro de Ornelas, have been delivered to 
the Azores, while the third in the Azores-bound quartet, 
Diogo de Teive, has been launched and is undergoing sea 
trials. As a demonstrably safe vessel type, capable of 
holding its own against rough tides and harsh weather, 
and as a versatile solution for multiple port tasks, the 
Interceptor 38 family may make their homes in a few 
more international locations yet.

T
he Navtech-designed workboat Le Cageux made its 
debut in June 2011, the vessel having been constructed 
to undertake wharf maintenance and repair works, as well 
as buoy and fender tendering, within her home port, 
namely the Port of Québec, Canada. Although based on a 
traditional workboat concept, the utilisation of modern 
shipbuilding engineering, handled by the Méridien 
Maritime Réparation yard, also based in Québec, plus the 
detailed design plans, submitted to the builder using 
ShipConstructor’s CAD / CAM software, has granted the 
vessel several unique elements. 
The vessel’s hull form is a continuation of Navtech’s single 
chine with skeg arrangement, a common feature among the 
small boats designed by the group. Optimised visibility is a 
key component of Le Cageux’s design: the wheelhouse has 
been fitted with no less than 18 panoramic windows, this 
arrangement providing the captain with 360deg views, for 
increased safety and awareness. The two-man crew’s mess, 
which has been fitted with storage lockers, a settee and table, 
is situated beneath the wheelhouse, and provides a direct 
means of accessing the engine room, via a watertight door. 
To boost manoeuvrability options, Navtech has 
incorporated two high-angle rudders into the workboat’s 
design. These rudders, which are activated by hydraulic 
cylinders, grant Le Cageux the ability to achieve a turning 
radius less than her 13m length. The vessel’s two Volvo Penta 
D9 MH turbocharged, in-line-six-cylinder engines, each 
delivering an output of 224bkW at 1800rpm, have been 
positioned forward and reverse, thus enabling her to engage 
in stationary rotation, and, driving twin Workhorse 
Michigan Wheel propellers, grant the vessel a typical service 
speed of 10knots – although a top speed of 11.5knots was 
recorded during her sea trials. 
Le Cageux has also been fitted with a Phasor Marine 
generator set, rated 12.5kV-120V, in order to power deck-
specialised tools. All of the engines aboard the vessel are 
seawater-cooled and incorporate wet exhaust design. 
Deck-wise, Le Cageux features a Heila HLM 2-2s 
hydraulic marine crane for fender tendering, which 
boasts a lifting capacity of up to 1.4tonnes at 1.7m. The 
rounded deck and transom edge have also been 
formulated to facilitate fender handling. And, to protect 
the vessel when it is engaged in duties alongside the Port 
of Québec’s piers, Le Cageux is supported by a modular 
Trelleborg fender. Similarly, Navtech has taken 
ergonomic factors into account in taking steps to base 
the design around a vibration-free set-up, for added 
crew comfort when undertaking long shifts.

L
ast year saw the launch of the Caribbean-bound fast 
passenger ferry Liberty, which, alongside the Austal-
built vehicle-passenger ferry Perle Express, left the 
builder’s yard in Henderson, Western Australia, for 
delivery to owner L’Express des Iles. Both vessels have 
been deployed on routes between Guadeloupe, Les 
Saintes, Marie Galante, Dominique, Martinique and St 
Lucia, where their primary goal is to boost the local 
tourist trade. According to Austal, Liberty is the first 
passenger vessel of her type to be flagged by the new 
French registry, Registre International Français. 
Staffed by seven members of crew, Liberty features the 
capacity to accommodate up to 437 passengers, as well 
as 15 cargo crates, with seating positioned over two 
decks.  Her overall fuel capacity is 16,000litres. The 
main differences between her and Perle Express are that 
the latter has mixed and matched its capacity to 
accommodate 360 passengers alongside 10 vehicles and 
17 cargo crates. 
For passenger safety in the event of an emergency, 
Liberty has been fitted with four small inflatable slides 
(SIS), supplied by life saving appliance manufacturer 
Zodiac. Each SIS has a length of 3.2m and grants 
passengers speedy access to four open reversible liferafts, 
each featuring a capacity of 151 persons. The SIS were 
selected by the operator as they were deemed to be the 
best evacuation solution for a vessel with Liberty’s 
comparatively low freeboard, and tests have 
demonstrated that, when packed to capacity, passengers 
aboard the ferry were able to undertake a complete 
evacuation of the vessel within nine minutes, using the 
SIS. 
The launch and delivery of Liberty also gave Austal 
the opportunity to extend its long-running relationship 
with electronics manufacturer Kelvin Hughes. As the 
ferry will be operating at significant speeds at night 
time, and in periods of occasional darkness, the team at 
L’Express des Iles specified the installation of 
navigational solutions from Kelvin Hughes, including 
the group’s SharpEye S-band radar technology and 
Manta Digital 508mm X-band radars, as well as 
electronic chart display and information system 
(ECDIS) and voyage data recorder (VDR) technology.

T
he delivery of Mangystau-4 completes  a cycle of 
five icebreaking tugs, designed by Aker Arctic 
Technology of Finland and built by the STX Braila 
shipyard in Romania on behalf of Caspian Offshore 
Construction (COC), all  of which were launched and 
delivered in an impressive period of 12 months.  Built 
to the specifications of Aker Arctic’s Aker ARC  104 
class, the vessels in this series were specifically developed 
to handle independent year-round operation in the 
often  treacherous conditions of the Northern Caspian 
Sea, a prime operational ground for COC and home to 
burgeoning offshore activity. 
Mangystau-4 is designed to function as an icebreaking 
tug for operation in shallow waters. As such, her 3m 
draught is matched with Bureau Veritas-accorded ICE 
CLASS SUPER 1A notation, in recognition of her ability 
to break through up to 60cm of ice and to clear ice rubble 
formations. The vessel’s engine arrangement comprises 
four Caterpillar 3512 C units, each generating 1786kW, 
which grants Mangystau-4 a top speed of 13knots and an 
impressive bollard pull of 50tonnes, making her more 
than fit for purpose when it comes to pushing barges in 
open water and ice conditions, as well as towing 
equipment throughout the region. 
 In addition to towing and pushing, the vessel was 
designed to undertake ice management operations in 
astern working mode, when surrounded by ice rubbles 
descending to the sea floor. According to Aker Arctic, at 
the summer load line draught, the vessel is capable of 
carrying up to 300tonnes of cargo on deck. In terms of 
environmental factors, Mangystau-4 and her cache of 
onboard equipment have been deemed suitable for 
operation in air temperatures between 40˚C and -35˚C 
and water temperatures ranging from 32˚C to -1˚C.  The 
vessel can also operate up to a maximum humidity of 80% 
and hold station when battered by 50knot winds. 
The vessel’s main propulsion is arranged by three 
asynchronous squirrel cage Indar AC motors, connected 
to couplings to the azimuthing Schottel SPR 2020 
propeller units. The motors are cooled by closed air 
circulation, provided with air-to-water heat exchangers.

T
he boom in offshore wind turbine arrays has led 
to corresponding demand for fit-for-purpose 
offshore wind farm support vessels, and, in June 2011, 
Damen Shipyards Group unveiled the 26m MarineCo 
Shamal, specifically built to serve as a fast crew supply 
vehicle for these installation types. The first in a series 
of four deliveries to Edinburgh, UK-based MarineCo 
UK, MarineCo Shamal represents the Dutch builder’s 
first move into offshore wind farm-compatible high-
speed support vessel (HSSV) production, as well as 
the first  sale of the group’s relatively new ‘Twin Axe’ 
catamaran concept. 
Built as vessel design type HSSV 2610, the cat can 
accommodate four members of crew, is licensed to 
carry up to 12 passengers, contains seating for up to 
24 persons and features a 20tonnes per metre deck 
crane upon a raised deck area with a maximum 
capacity of 15tonnes. Damen’s remit was to take into 
account challenges linked to scale, water depth and 
distance from shore when developing the vessel. At 
its most basic, the combination of raised work deck 
and sea axe bows is intended to assist the vessel in 
retaining high speed, even when encountering high 
sea states. This latter factor is important as it grants 
the vessel a wider scope of  possibilities for 
deployment, widening its operational window and 
enabling the vessel to take advantage of a greater 
number of charter options. 
According to Damen, the Twin Axe design builds 
on its previous Axe Bow concept, unveiled in the 
mid-2000s, albeit having being tailored to provide a 
more stable platform within the Workboat Code 1 
range. The group claims that, when compared to 
conventional catamaran designs with similar 
displacement ratings, the Twin Axe concept is capable 
of granting operators reduced peak accelerations of 
up to 75%, reduced calm water resistance up to 15% 
and reduced added resistance in waves of up to 60%. 
The shape of the Axebow works to maximise the 
waterline length and keep the bow in the water, 
leading to reductions in both slamming and fuel 
consumption. 
Indeed, during trials conducted at Delft University 
in the Netherlands, the vessel was able to demonstrate 
that, when operating at speeds of around 25knots, a 
10% reduction in fuel consumption was seen when 
compared to conventional catamarans of the same 
displacement. The tests also demonstrated vertical 
peak accelerations of only 40% compared to 
conventional work catamarans.
Additionally, the vessel’s front fendering has been 
designed for impact speeds over 3knots. The HSSV is 
also fitted with a fuel transfer system so that it can be 
used to transfer fuel to wind turbines, should this be 
required. In total, MarineCo Shamal boasts the 
capacities to handle 21.5m
3 of fuel oil, 1.8m
3 of fresh 
water and 0.5m
3 of waste water. 
Since the vessel was delivered to her home port of 
Leith, Edinburgh, Damen has also launched and 
delivered  the second vessel in the series, MarineCo 
Mariah, with the third and fourth in the series 
scheduled to be handed over to MarineCo UK in 
2012. And, Damen says, MarineCo Shamal has 
already proved her worth to her owner; the group 
recounts: “During a severe gale in September 2011, 
MarineCo Shamal left a UK port for a maintenance 
job at an offshore wind farm while other support 
vessels had to stay behind.” It is this sort of attention 
to detail and design that is bound to entice cost- and 
safety-conscious offshore wind farm support vessel 
operators, and why we have nominated the first in the 
HSSV 2610 series as one of our Significant Small Ships 
of 2011.

U
K-based boatbuilder South Boats Special Projects 
has carved out a respectable niche for itself in the 
offshore wind farm support vessel sector, having 
produced more than 40 of these craft types as demand 
escalates, particularly in Europe. The launch and 
delivery of MCS Zephyr in April 2011 was of special 
interest to industry observers, not least for its 
arrangement, but also for the fact that it became the 
first vessel of its type to feature Norwegian class society 
Det Norske Veritas’(DNV’s)  1A1 HSLC R2 Wind 
Farm Service 1 notation. MCS Zephyr has subsequently 
been deployed on the BARD offshore wind farm, 
situated off the coast of Germany, where she is 
operating alongside sister ship MCS Maestro, which was 
delivered in Summer 2011. 
The catamaran has an overall length of 19.1m, a beam 
of 7.4m and a draught of 1.1m, while her lightship 
displacement comes to 38tonnes. The wheelhouse has 
been built aft of centre, providing a 34m
2 forward deck 
which can handle a maximum of 8tonnes of 
construction and offshore equipment. The vessel’s 21m
2 
aft deck is capable of carrying another 2tonnes’ worth of 
equipment. 
The wheelhouse has been fitted with the South Boats 
Integrated Bridge, which was developed in conjunction 
with MAP and Boat Electrics & Electronics, and 
incorporates equipment supplied by electronic 
monitoring solutions specialist Boning. The integrated 
bridge provides the vessel’s skipper with five 482.5mm 
displays, giving him the opportunity to zone in on and 
monitor particular details linked to the system. 
Onboard satellite communications comes courtesy of 
Iridium’s Openport solution. 
The vessel is capable of cruising at approximately 
24knots while on duty, and her top speed has been 
recorded at nearly 26knots, thanks to a pair of MTU 
8V2000M72 diesel engines, each generating 710kW. 
Installed hydraulics include a pair of ZF3000 gearboxes, 
which power the following systems; a Palfinger  PK6500 
fully-folding, knuckle boom crane; a fire pump with a 
pressure of 5bar, featuring a capacity of 30,000litres per 
hour; a 1.5tonne hydraulic capstan; a clutched and 
braked anchor spool winch; a 210bar, 30litre/min 
pressure washer system; and an 8bar fuel transfer 
system. The vessel’s ring main and AC services rely on 
an Onan 13.5kW, 230V AC generator set. 
In terms of ergonomics, the onboard saloon features 
12 seats, six to port and six to starboard, and the vessel 
incorporates a spacious changing area and lockers for 
storage of spare parts. For extra crew convenience, all 
windows aboard MCS Zephyr have been double glazed 
to reduce condensation, while the forward screens are 
heated to prevent misting, thereby granting the onboard 
technicians increased visibility. The machine areas have 
been fitted with air intake / extraction systems and anti-
noise/vibration matting.

W
hen it comes to developing hybrid fireboat / tug 
designs, Canada’s Robert Allan would appear to 
be on a mission to extend as far as possible beyond the 
standard Fi-Fi 1 classification requirements that cover 
the bulk of these boats, and the March 2011- launched 
RAstar 3900 class Mojaweb seems to be further proof of 
this strategy. The 39.1m vessel, which was ordered by 
Kuwait Fire Services for safety operations within the 
Kuwaiti port of Shuwaikh, has been certified by Lloyd’s 
Register as a Fi-Fi 2 craft, packing a punch with a 
combined pump capacity of 8400m
3 per hour. 
Robert Allan was commissioned to come up with the 
vessel design by Kuwait-based Al Boom Marine, while 
Korean builder Simulation Tech Inc (STI) was tasked with 
her physical construction. Featuring a moulded beam of 
13.5m, a top operating draught of 5.1m and a minimum 
bollard pull of 60tonnes ahead (68tonnes ahead was 
recorded during her sea trials), the vessel has the capacity 
to carry 252m
3 of fuel oil, 57m
3 of potable water, 38m
3 of 
fire-fighting foam and just under 3m
3 of lubricant oil. 
Mojaweb’s ballast capacity is measured at 67.8m
3 and her 
top speed has been recorded at 13.1knots during trials, 
although 12knots is her intended operating speed.  
As well as handling fire-fighting duties, Mojaweb has 
been designed to undertake ship-handling and tanker 
support work. Subsequently, the vessel’s deck comes 
equipped with a 75tonne safe working load (SWL) tow 
hook on the aft deck and a hawser winch on the foredeck. 
The vessel is capable of accommodating a maximum 
operating crew of 14, and features a total of 13 berths. 
Nine of these berths can be considered dedicated for crew, 
while the remaining four can accommodate survivors or 
additional fire-fighters.
As with previous Robert Allan Fi-Fi tugs, Mojaweb 
incorporates the company’s signature RAstar hull form, 
featuring an outward sponson on the upper hull sides for 
increased stability. When conducting vessel-escorting 
duties, should the tug be heeled over as a result of the 
angle or influence of the towline, the sponson is 
submerged and acts to right the vessel. 
The hull also features an extended skeg, positioned 
forward, for roll-damping purposes, and the overall hull 
form is intended to reduce roll amplitude and roll 
accelerations, for added safety and crew and passenger 
comfort. The designer claims that, following a series of 
private model tests, the roll accelerations recorded for the 
RAstar concept were some 60% lower than in equivalently 
sized, ‘wall-sided’ or conventional hull forms. Additionally, 
the design of the hull is capable of guaranteeing superior 
fuel economy during the vessel’s operational cycle, Robert 
Allan claims. 
The tug’s power comes courtesy of a pair of Wärtsilä 
6L26 medium-speed diesel engines, each rated 1946kW 
at 1000rpm, which drive a Wärtsilä-Lips CS250-CP 
Z-drive unit, with a 2400mm diameter propeller. Twin 
CAT C-18 diesel gensets, each rated 275ekW, provide the 
vessel’s auxiliary power. 
Before submitting its plans to Al Boom Marine, Robert 
Allan opted for a Wärtsilä 8L26 diesel pump engine, rated 
2590kW at 1000rpm. The centreline Wärtsilä 8L26 
auxiliary engine drives two 2400m
3 FFS ENM 350 fi-fi 
pumps, supplied by Fire Fighting Systems AS [FFS], off 
each end, while the two Wärtsilä 6L26 propulsion engines 
each drive an 1800m
3 FFS ENM 300 Fi-Fi pump off the 
front end. The end result would appear to be a potent 
means of combating fires and handling various generic 
vessel-escorting tasks, combined in one package.

P
erhaps better known  for producing a wide range of 
workboat types, including hybrid seismic support 
vessels, anchor handling tug supply vessels and dive 
maintenance craft, Dubai-based Grandweld Shipyards 
managed to squeeze in a first this year with the launch 
and delivery of a 24m, aluminium-hulled forward 
landing crew boat, the first of its kind to grace the 
builder’s native UAE. 
In addition to her primary role _ namely, transporting a 
complement of up to 25 technical engineers to various 
offshore structures across the region _ the vessel, Mutawa202, 
incorporates a number of multipurpose functionalities 
into her design, as part of Grandweld’s ‘Dolphin’ class 
concept. Constructed at Grandweld’s Al Jadaf Ship 
Docking Yard facility, the vessel was delivered to 
operator Mutawa Marine Works in July 2011, bringing 
the latter company’s tally of offshore vessels to 11.  
Upon delivery, Mutawa202  was chartered to oil major 
Total, where she is  helping to support the 
multinational’s oil and gas operations within the UAE. 
Speed would appear to have played a recurring role with 
regards to this contract; the vessel is reportedly also the 
fastest that Total has had the chance to deploy to date, 
while Grandweld has hailed the rapid, nine-month 
turnaround time between contract and delivery as its 
fastest crew boat order to date. 
Safety has played a large part in Grandweld’s 
considerations. For a start, Mutawa202 features a 
customised forward bow fender, designed to enable 
steady and secure landing onto dedicated offshore 
landing structures. Once this has been achieved, 
offshore personnel can directly disembark to the 
offshore platform in a timely and safe fashion. Also, as a 
first for the UAE, the presence of the vessel will enable 
the technicians to bypass the expensive and time-
consuming process of having to charter helicopter 
flights to their offshore facilities. 
The ‘Dolphin’ class also features safety and crew 
comfort advantages such as enhanced manoeuvrability in 
rough sea states, courtesy of three HamiltonJet HM461 
waterjets; low noise and vibration levels,  with noise 
dampened to below 70dB within the vessel’s passenger 
area; full air conditioning within the three crew 
accommodation areas; and 360deg visibility from the 
wheelhouse, courtesy of all-round windows. This latter 
factor has become an increasing design trend for crew 
transportation boats, enabling a swift response from the 
pilot should problems arise when the vessel is docking at 
the offshore platforms, and / or during the embarkation / 
disembarkation process. The passenger area itself is 
afforded extra protection by being situated in the vessel’s 
bulwark, while the crew’s cabins are connected to the 
wheelhouse via a stairwell.
Additionally, Mutawa202 is equipped with four liferafts, 
each featuring 20-man capacity. Meanwhile, the vessel’s 
external firefighting system is capable of delivering a 
combined flow rate of 300m
3 per hour, to cope with the 
eventuality of a conflagration whilst in operation. 
In terms of capacity, Mutawa202 can count on some 
10m
2 of clear deck space, thanks to the positioning of 
her wheelhouse at the aft. The deck area has been 
recorded as exerting a strength of 2.2tonnes per m
2, 
subsequently enabling a maximum deck cargo capacity 
of 7tonnes. She can carry 9000litres of fuel oil and 
1000litres of potable water. 
Understandably perhaps, Grandweld is now looking to 
secure further orders for the ‘Dolphin’ class concept 
within the UAE, in an attempt to offer the region a 
financially advantageous alternative to airborne technician 
transportation, as well as the ability to dock safely on 
arrival. With oil and gas exploration and production only 
set to increase within this territory, one expects to see more 
Dolphin crew transfer vessels, or at least variations on this 
first-in-class design, in the not so distant future.

N
ordic, a 78m x 16.5m emergency tow vessel (ETV) 
operating around the East Frisian islands, North 
Sea, was commissioned by the German Federal Ministry 
of Transport, Construction and Urban Development, 
in response to 1998’s MS Pallas incident. When MS 
Pallas suffered an onboard fire off the island of Amrum, 
attempts to salvage the vessel were undermined by the 
blaze, which raged for nearly a month. As a result of the 
tug’s inability to cope with the burning wreck, MS 
Pallas drifted towards the coast and ran aground, 
spilling 200m
3 of oil in German waters. 
The incident highlighted the need for an advanced 
tug, capable of withstanding the emission of hazardous 
or toxic material from the vessels it could potentially 
encounter – particularly the case when approaching 
chemical carriers. The tender for the provision of Nordic 
was picked up by the Coastal Protection Consortium, 
comprising three German tug operators and salvors _ 
Bugsier, Fairplay Towage and Unterweser Reederei _   in 
2008. The vessel was built at the Peene Werft yard in 
Wolgast and completed in October 2010, with the 
Coastal Protection Consortium charterting her to the 
German government. 
Nordic boasts a top speed of 19.5knots and up to 
201tonnes bollard pull capacity. Demand for greater 
speed for faster responses guided the design of the 
ETV’s bulbous bow, while the enclosed, rounded stern, 
modelled on typical salvage tug designs, grants Nordic’s 
crew additional safety whilst making a towing 
connection on the towing deck. The design also 
incorporates high bulwarks, backed by large scuppers, 
to prevent large waves from thundering down upon the 
working deck, while any excess water is drained by a 
water trench, care of a large transverse channel situated 
below deck at the vessel’s forward end. 
Nordic deploys two engines, based on the 20-cylinder 
MTU Series 8000 model, adapted by MTU specifically 
for this project, in order to cope with hazardous 
environments. Generating 8600kW apiece, the two Series 
8000 engines are complemented by two gensets with type 
12V 4000 M50A diesel engines, capable of a combined 
2280kW. The engine types manage to combine high 
power output with flammable-atmosphere safety 
accreditation, approved by class society Germanischer 
Lloyd (GL), which has deemed the vessel as meeting the 
notations for being “suitable for use in hazardous 
atmosphere”. 
Given the potential risk of an engine explosion, MTU 
has also supplied its Callosum integrated automation 
system to Nordic. Callosum provides a platform to link all 
peripheral propulsion systems, as well as monitoring 
propulsion, the onboard power supply, conventional 
rudders and the vessel’s bilge and water tanks. 
Additionally, a sensor has been included to provide real-
time monitoring of the temperature in the air intake 
system, in order to alert the operator should the heat 
within this component rise beyond 135°C – at which 
level the risk of gas and air combining and self-igniting 
increases greatly.  
For crew safety and security, Nordic features an 
overpressure system within the vessel’s citadel area, which 
operates independently of the tug’s external environment. 
The system, designed jointly by Bugsier, Peene Werft, 
Draeger Safety and Skipskonsulent, grants the ETV the 
ability to operate for a minimum of eight hours within a 
hazardous atmosphere, with gas-tight doors, windows, 
scuppers and hatches protecting the crew from the effects 
of toxic and chemical spillage. Onboard personnel can 
manually set the citadel to a gas-tight state while Nordic is 
on the approach to a stricken tanker or chemical carrier, 
while a countdown clock displays how much time is left 
before the ETV should withdraw. The citadel can be 
accessed via two airlocks, both featuring extendable 
dimensions, to assist crew who are wearing bulky, 
protective clothing and/or carrying objects. The airlocks 
connect to the main deck and A-deck, the latter providing 
access to a medical treatment room.

C
anadian marine designer Robert Allan and Chinese 
shipbuilder Cheoy Lee Shipyards have enjoyed a 
long-standing collaborative relationship since the pair 
teamed up in 2004, to deliver the first Z-Tech class tug, 
Indee, to BHP Billiton Iron Ore, and the former group 
estimates that Cheoy Lee has produced approximately 
50 of its tug designs in the seven years since, with 
approximately 10 of these including the designer’s 
RAmparts 2800 and 3000 series. 
Fittingly, then, the summer of 2011 saw Cheoy Lee 
deliver two 32m by 12.4m sister tugs, built to Robert 
Allan’s new RAmparts 3200-CL class specifications, the 
duo comprising Ocean Pioneer and Ocean Perfect. Both 
vessels were successfully delivered to Ocean Sparkle in 
India, providing a change from Cheoy Lee’s constant 
Z-Tech 6500 tug output on behalf of the Panama Canal 
Authority, and are reported to be currently operating in 
Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
Both Ocean Pioneer and her sister are constructed 
from steel and feature twin air start Caterpillar 3516B 
diesel engines, each of which is capable of generating 
1839kW. These engines drive a pair of azimuthing 
Schottel SRP1215FP fixed-pitch rudder propellers, 
resulting in a maximum speed of 13knots, a bollard pull 
of 62tonnes and enhanced manoeuvrability options. 
Electrical power is supplied courtesy of two 3-phase 
112kW Perkins generators, while a 40kW unit is 
utilised for harbour service. 
The vessel is well equipped to undertake the 
responsibilities expected of her, with deck equipment 
including items such as a single-drum towing winch / 
windlass, supplied by MacGregor, positioned at her bow. 
A MacGregor single-drum winch, cruciform towing bitt 
and a Mampaey towing hook with remote release are 
present on her aft, as is a fixed-arm davit, enabling Ocean 
Pioneer’s crew to launch a Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)-
approved, six-person capacity inflatable rescue boat in the 
event of an emergency. 
Fire-fighting capability has gradually become a mainstay 
feature of Robert Allan’s internationally delivered tugs, 
and Ocean Pioneer is no exception. One main engine 
provides the power for a Fire Fighting Systems (FFS) 
supplied fire pump,  which is rated at 2740m
3 per hour. 
This pump, in turn, feeds two FFS-supplied fire monitors, 
each rated at 1200m
3 per hour. This configuration has 
granted Ocean Pioneer and her sister Fi-Fi 1 class notation, 
and has granted Ocean Sparkle a higher degree of 
confidence when facing the possibility of tackling onboard 
blazes in her area of deployment.

T
he largest vessel to feature in this year’s Significant 
Small Ships, the 110.6m loa Polar King, built and 
co-designed by Spain’s Freire Shipyard, comprises a 
multidisciplinary oceanographic research vessel, 
especially developed to undertake remotely operated 
vehicle (ROV) and research operations in territories 
such as the Arabian Gulf, Arabian Sea and Red Sea, 
focusing on fishing and marine biology, chemical 
oceanography and seabed-mapping. 
To support thorough surveys, Polar King notably 
boasts a range of 14 days, with a surge capacity for 21 
days in extreme circumstances. The vessel has been 
designed with a raked stern and a bulbous bow, while 
the transom includes a ramp. At port side, on the main 
deck, a recess with ladders has been installed, to assist 
the vessel’s divers in entering the water.  In terms of 
appearance, Freire Shipyard believes that this particular 
general arrangement, including the creation of a 
streamlined shape via the distribution of the volumes of 
her superstructures, could inform the look of a new 
generation of survey and research vessels. 
Polar King relies on a hybrid propulsive arrangement, 
incorporating diesel and electric sources via twin 
medium diesel engines, resiliently mounted, and each 
driving a variable pitch propeller through a vertical step 
gearbox. The vessel is capable of manoeuvring at low 
speed with dynamic positioning, even when 
encountering wind speeds of 20knots and current 
speeds of 1.5knots, enabling the crew to launch the 
onboard scientific equipment in a variety of weather 
conditions – although, ironically perhaps, considering 
her name, Freire claims that the vessel is not capable of 
operating in Polar areas. 
The crew accommodation and laboratories are situated 
on the main and upper decks. The engine room layout has 
also been designed to reduce noise and vibration. As some 
scientific operating profiles require continuous underwater 
survey or towing operations, at speeds ranging from 
1.5knots to her normal cruising speed of 14knots at 85% 
MCR, similar considerations were taken into account 
regarding the impacts of Polar King’s engine operation, 
maintenance and emissions, exhaust gas ingestion and 
water-making capability whilst on-station or moving at 
slow speeds for extended periods of time. 
For remote survey work, the vessel houses a Navajo 
Portable ROV, controlled by acoustic positioning 
integrated with her DP system. The ROV features a 
maximum operating depth of 100m and a forward speed 
of 3.5knots, and features the capability to take high-
definition photographs. Polar King also features an 
aluminium, one-man  transportable decompression 
chamber, with a working pressure of 7bar and a medical 
lock, complete with pressure gauge, equilibrium valve and 
waste tap. Finally, the vessel incorporates an 250cm
2 
dredge and a 1000cm
2 grab.

R
eportedly the first small vessel of this type to be 
built in New Zealand in some time, the Shipco-
constructed, 15m PT May represents an admirable 
attempt to marry the looks of a conventional 
workboat with the performance of a Z-drive ship-
handling tug. 
The tug incorporates independent steering nozzles 
to enhance her manoeuvrability, enabling her to 
also move sideways as required. According to 
Shipco, this arrangement enables the user to achieve 
35degs of steerage to port and starboard in 12 
seconds. The vessel’s three steering stations are 
located in the wheelhouse, on the flybridge and at 
the winch station. 
A power output of 882.6kW grants the vessel a 
free running speed of 10knots, 10.5knots 
maximum, with bollard pull capacities of 17tonnes 
ahead and 14tonnes astern. 
The flooring in both the wheelhouse and 
accommodation areas has been based on a floating-
type design, in order to reduce noise and vibrations 
for the tug’s two-man crew. With this in mind, Shipco 
has also incorporated a resiliently mounted arrangement 
for the vessel’s main engines, which are positioned on 
Lorez spring-type vibration isolators, and PT May’s 
exhaust piping and mufflers have undergone similar 
mounting arrangements. Ocean Breeze supplied the 
boat’s air conditioning system. 
Shipco was also responsible for the fendering of the 
vessel. PT May incorporates a 1.1m-wide double loop 
tyre fendering system, with a depth of 500mm, around 
her bow and forward shoulders. At the aft, the fendering 
set-up comprises a 1m-diameter, 500mm-wide stretch 
of aircraft tyres, attached to the hull via chains. 
Completing this arrangement are two rows of single-cut 
tyre fenders. 
Shipco also designed and fabricated PT May’s 
hydraulically-driven capstan, which features a waist 
diameter of 500mm and can generate a 5tonne pull at 
20m per minute. 
The vessel’s 37kW towing winch is powered by an 
ABB variable speed drive, and  features a holding 
capacity of 75tonnes. The drum has a diameter of 
610mm and a capacity of 550m x 32mm diameter 
wire in six layers, and line pull capacity has been 
evaluated at 11 tonnes at 15m per minute. The 
actual winch control console, complete with 
joystick, has been placed on the engine casing deck 
forward of the winch. Onboard generator sets 
include 80ekW Cummins 6B-CP and 136ekW 
Cummins 6C-CP units. 
While PT May could be the first vessel of this type to 
come out of New Zealand in quite some time, she was 
not slow in being joined by a sister vessel, PT Mary. 
Together, the duo have added a smart and nifty means 
of boosting Pacific Tug’s operations.

T
he Rainbow Warrior series of Greenpeace vessels has 
proven monumental in capturing the public’s 
imagination, providing the environmental pressure 
group with a waterborne means of combating illegal 
incidents of whale-culling, toxic dumping and shipments of 
unauthorised timber. In the past, the group has relied on 
repurposed vessels to take to the waves, the most famous 
being the Rainbow Warrior, converted from a fishing trawler, 
who lost her own personal fight in July 1985, when she was 
bombed by French foreign intelligence agents off the coast 
of New Zealand. 
Following this outrage, Greenpeace commissioned 
Rainbow Warrior II, a 55m, three-masted schooner, to carry 
on its activities. Since her launch in 1989, the second in the 
series has sustained 22 years’ worth of police raids, attacks 
from other vessels and serious wear and tear over the course 
of her activities. Such heavy duty handling was bound to 
take its toll, prompting Greenpeace to take the 
unprecedented move of co-designing and ordering its first 
custom-made vessel, Rainbow Warrior III, and eschewing the 
rust buckets of old. In August 2011, in anticipation of the 
imminent delivery of the third craft, Rainbow Warrior II was 
donated as a hospital ship to Friendship, a Bangladesh-based 
NGO, where she will round out her days serving the 
healthcare needs of impoverished communities situated 
between the coast of Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal. 
Constructed by German shipbuilder Fassmer, Rainbow 
Warrior III has been developed primarily to utilise sail power, 
in line with Greenpeace’s overall philosophy of 
environmental protection and slashing emissions to a 
minimum. According to the yard, the A-frame design of her 
55m mast system and her hull shape were designed for 
maximum fuel conservation, with the vessel achieving a 
speed of 14knots when using sails only, during sea trials. The 
1260m
2 sail surface is spread across five jibs which can be 
rolled in and out automatically, courtesy of a control console 
situated in the outer deck on the port and starboard side. 
Like her overall superstructure, the A-frame masts are 
fashioned from aluminium and feature one-man elevators, 
enabling crew to effect repairs to the masts and antennae as 
and when needed.  The vessel features a top fuel capacity of 
110,000litres and a fresh water capacity of 32,000litres.
Should Rainbow Warrior III encounter unfavourable 
weather conditions, particularly when her crew are on patrol 
or engaged in action, the vessel can simply switch over to 
engine-powered, diesel-electric propulsion to continue 
about her business. As back-up, Fassmer has included a 
diesel-electronic drive, made available over two auxiliary 
diesels, each generating 383kW and feeding the onboard 
electrical supply and a 330kW electric drive motor. This 
latter motor is coupled with the gear over a power take-in 
(PTI) system, subsequently driving the adjustable-pitch 
propeller system. In tests, Greenpeace discovered that a 
speed of up to 10knots could be achieved utilising the 
330kW motor. Should the crew need a burst of speed, 
however, the main Caterpillar engine can deliver a hearty 
1425kW, granting the vessel a top speed of 15knots. 
Similar environmental considerations include the 
installation of an oily bilge water separator, capable of 
reducing oil and grease content in discharged water to less 
than 5ppm, plus the capacity to keep up to 59m
3 worth of 
grey water and processed black water on board in safe, ‘no 
discharge’ areas. The vessel’s underside was designed with 
underwater inspections in mind, intended to cut drydocking 
frequency from 2.5 to five years, thus limiting more 
environmental fallout from dock-based repair jobs. Linking 
the vessel’s onboard conference room and press office are a 
couple of satellite terminals, namely a VSAT Seatel 4009 for 
global data exchange, and an Inmarsat FleetBroadband 500 
model, for data and voice. 
This commitment to low emissions, plus the versatility of 
the vessel’s power options, definitely make Rainbow Warrior 
III a significant vessel of the past 12 months and proof of 
further steps towards the realisation of energy-efficient, fuel-
conserving vessels, without necessarily handicapping speed. 
For sure, polluters may not welcome her addition to the 
world’s sea lanes – but we certainly do.

here was a buzz of excitement in the Netherlands in 
August 2011, following the delivery of Sarissa, a state-of-
the-art performance sailing yacht, which, with an overall 
length of 42.6m, was hailed as the largest carbon sloop to have 
been constructed within the territory to date. The vessel was 
delivered to the owner’s representative, Jens Cornelsen Yacht 
Consultant, for deployment, as a floating family home, 
around the world and as a competitive racer in established 
international superyacht regattas, such as St Barths, Palma, 
Sardinia and St Tropez. 
Indeed, according to Rhoades Young Design, which 
supplied the design plans for Sarissa’s interior: “She was 
designed for a young family to have big adventures on…
and to be very modern but without the trappings of cold, 
sparse interiors…she had to feel like a warm and inviting 
family home.”
Vitters Shipyard, which handled the bulk of Sarissa’s 
construction, built on its previous experience of producing 
carbon sailing yachts, installing an electronically controlled 
load sense system for the vessel’s hydraulic systems, with 
variable displacement pumps, to improve reaction speed, load 
and stiffness. Vitters also installed its in-house steering system 
with supported feedback, to ensure comfortable hydraulic 
steering in all sorts of weather conditions. All hull and 
superstructure material is fashioned from carbon composite. 
The vessel features a 51m main mast and has been 
constructed for two sailing configurations; cruising and 
racing. In cruising mode, Sarissa is able to deploy a 
conventional, triangle-shaped sail, switching to a square top 
main sail for racing activities. As the design for these two 
configurations resulted in the main sail area increasing by 
20% in size, Vitters installed a dual system of back stays and 
running back stays, to optimise the advantages of both sails 
while accommodating them within the sloop’s specified 
geometry. Under sail, Sarissa is capable of achieving an 
average sailing speed of 12knots, rising to a maximum of 
18knots. When utilising her sole Caterpillar C12 engine, she 
can attain a cruise speed of 11knots, increasing to a top speed 
of 14knots. 
In addition, in order to achieve a low freeboard for best 
results when racing, both Vitters and Green Marine 
integrated Sarissa’s cap rail into the construction of the hull, 
making sure that the cap rail would only reach the height of 
the teak deck, so as not to have a joint at deck level. 
Back inside the vessel, the leading design brief was to 
ensure optimisation of visual length within Sarissa’s interior. 
The yacht’s dining room and galley have been placed 
forward of the bulkhead, with a sliding door that can enclose 
the galley, either demarcating it as part of the crew area when 
closed, or, when left open, creating a galley dining space. 
During the day, this sliding door is hidden and, in 
conjunction with staggering the accommodation blocks 
diagonally, Rhoades Young Design estimates that this design 
solution has succeeded in increasing the visual length of the 
interior from 8.5m to 13.5m. Tripp Design has also paired 
the vessel’s vertical port lights, resulting in a window that 
floods Sarissa’s interior with light.

T
he 14m Sea Herald was one of two significant 2011 
workboat deliveries for Macduff Shipyards last 
year, 
alongside 
the 
12.95m 
Maid 
Marion. 
Commissioned by the Aberdeen Harbour Board, the 
yard’s Macduff Ship Design sister group contrived to 
design a new multi-purpose workboat capable of 
handling demanding  plough dredging, debris 
collection, surveying, dive support, lifting, harbour 
repairs and occasional pilotage duties. 
Designed specifically to meet the requirements of 
Aberdeen Harbour, the first-in-class Sea Herald is 
certified to the MCA Code of Practice for Small 
Commercial Vessels up to 24m load line length, Category 
3. All certification for this vessel was also carried out by 
the SCMSS. The vessel is of all welded steel construction, 
including the wheelhouse, and the large deck area has 
been bolstered by soft wood sacrificial decking to 
withstand miscellaneous deck cargos, granting her a deck 
cargo capacity of approximately 6tonnes. A  hydraulically 
hinged collection basket has been mounted into the bow, 
to collect trash from the surface of the harbour, and this 
device empties into a series of skips positioned on the 
foredeck forward of the wheelhouse. Her tank capacities 
are 4270litres for oil fuel, 215litres for fresh water and 
grey water apiece, and 9000litres for ballast water.
Sea Herald relies on a propulsive arrangement of twin 
Scania DI12 59M engines, each rated 261kW at 
1800rpm and driving four-bladed Kort Propulsion 
fixed pitch 1300mm diameter propellers in Kort nozzles 
through Twin Disc QuickShift gearboxes of type MGX 
5114 DC, 4.59:1 ratio. The main engines and 
gearboxes, which are flexibly mounted on Southern 
Cross polyflex mounts to reduce noise and vibration, 
grant her a bollard pull rating of 9.5tonnes and a top 
free running speed of 9.6knots, both of which factors 
exceeded the Aberdeen Harbour Board’s original spec 
requests. Insulation within the engine room is also 
intended to curtail onboard noise. 
To optimise manoeuvrability, two Aerofoil rudders are 
operated by a Southern Cross Hydrive electric/hydraulic 
steering system. This set-up is  further enhanced with a 
Kort Propulsion KT 30DD hydraulic bow thruster with a 
thrust of 320kg. According to Macduff, even without the 
bow thrusters, the vessel can turn within its own length.
An Onan 19 MDKBV unit serves as auxiliary back-up, 
delivering 19 kW single phase and housed within an 
acoustic box. All engines are keel cooled via Fernstrum 
grid coolers supplied by Kort Propulsion. They are 
positioned and protected to avoid damage when working 
in extremely shallow water, or should the vessel happen to 
dry out. The vessel’s deck machinery package  includes a 
Guerra M110.90A2 deck crane, with a capacity of 1.5 
tonnes at 7.9m, complete with winch and grab. 
Meanwhile, for plough dredging duties, the vessel is fitted 
with twin 7tonne SR60 hydraulic winches forward and 
one identical winch just aft of the wheelhouse. These three 
winches can be controlled from the wheelhouse. The 
plough dredge can be carried either on the main deck aft, 
or brought in through a gap in the aft bulwark and carried 
fore and aft on the main deck.
Sea Herald has also been constructed with an offset 
wheelhouse with deep windows, to grant the pilot all 
round visibility, especially over the entirety of the working 
deck. This offset design also grants the vessel a higher 
degree of versatility, allowing her to stand in for Aberdeen 
Harbour’s conventional pilot boats in the event of an 
emergency; the wheelhouse is offset to port, thereby 
leaving a clear side deck for boarding, with additional 
safety provided by a Hadrian rail system. Additionally, a 
Reson Applanix POS MV and Reson Navi Sound 620 
single beam echo sounder have been installed, granting 
her the ability to undertake detailed survey work.

elivered to Italian tug operator Rimorchiatrori 
Riuniti in October 2011, the Robert Allan-
designed RAmparts 3000W tug St Elmo is currently 
being put through her paces within and around Malta’s 
territorial waters, deployed on behalf of the operator’s 
Tug Malta subsidiary. As befits her name, the 
30.25m-long vessel, whose order constituted a welcome 
ray through the recession-laden clouds for Spanish 
shipbuilder Astilleros Zamakona’s Pasaia yard, was 
blessed by Archbishop Paul Cremona of Malta upon 
her christening – though the vessel has clearly been 
designed and assembled to get by on more than the 
power of prayer alone. 
St Elmo’s RAmparts 3000W design features a notably 
wider beam than typical members of the standard 
RAmparts 3000 family, and this enhancement enables her 
to take full advantage of a pleasingly large working deck 
for a tug of this length. In total, the deck area can 
accommodate up to six 2.4x2.4m containers. 
Modern tugs are consistently rocketing in terms of 
strength, and St Elmo is no exception. Her propulsive 
arrangement of two Caterpillar 3516B engines, rated at 
2100kW at 1600rpm apiece, and each driving a Rolls-
Royce US 255P30 fixed-pitch Z-drive through twin-disc 
marine control drives, has granted the vessel a mean ahead 
bollard pull (bp) capacity of 75tonnes and a mean astern 
bp of 71tonnes, while her free-running speed has been 
logged at 13knots. Onboard electrical power is provided 
by two Caterpillar C6.6 diesel generating sets, each rated 
125eKW at 1500rpm, in addition to a harbour genset, 
supplied by Deutz, which generates 78eKW at 1500rpm. 
With this power at her disposal, the tug incorporates a 
hydraulically driven, double-drum, render-recover escort 
winch, manufactured by Ibercisa and situated on her 
foredeck. The winch set-up is bolstered by the addition of 
an adjustable constant tensioning system, which enables 
St Elmo’s crew to monitor loads from the wheelhouse. The 
tug’s aft deck is equipped with a 100tonne safe working 
load (SWL) gob eye, a 4tonne vertical capstan, a 75tonne 
SWL remote quick-release tow hook and a 25tonnes-per-
metre knuckle boom crane. 
When it comes to fire-fighting capacity, St Elmo is no 
slouch: her Fi-Fi 1 – compliant system comprises a pair of 
main engine-driven centrifugal pumps, manufactured by 
long-term Robert Allan favourite Fire Fighting Systems. 
Each pump has a capacity of 1358m
3 per hour, and both 
monitors are capable of delivering 1200m
3 per hour of 
water, with one of these units able to deliver 300m
3 per 
hour of foam. Additional life-saving equipment includes a 
4m rigid inflatable boat (RIB), fitted with an outboard 
motor rated at 18.4kW and a Safety Of Life at Sea 
(SOLAS)-compliant launch davit, should the crew need 
to respond to an emergency. 
For crew comfort, Robert Allan specified resilient 
mounting of the vessel’s main engines, and the use of 
visco-elastic floating floor systems throughout St Elmo’s 
interior, in order to severely curb noise and vibrations. 
The vessel can accommodate a maximum of 10 persons in 
total, and the wheelhouse has been ergonomically 
designed to ensure an increased scope of visibility for crew. 
The mess area, galley, WC and two officer cabins are 
situated on the main deck, while the lower accommodation 
deck hosts two crew cabins, a WC and shower, and a 
stores room.

T
he boom in offshore wind turbine installations 
fuelled much of the optimism shared by smaller 
boatbuilders in 2011, with specialist producers in this 
vessel class enjoying high demand for new solutions, 
and the industry unanimously agreeing that is one of 
the hotter segments to be involved in at present. A great 
deal of effort has especially gone into reassessing the 
concept of fast, personnel-carrying craft, to safely and 
efficiently carry technicians from shore to the wind 
farm installations and back. 
For Qatar-headquartered operator Topaz Marine, 
collaboration between the group’s in-house Topaz 
Engineering shipbuilding entity and Australian builder, 
designer and catamaran specialist Incat Crowther, has 
resulted in an interesting new vessel, designed not to ride 
the waves but to pierce through them, in order to achieve 
a higher speed at the same rate of fuel consumption, while 
simultaneously reducing its fuel consumption when 
operating at the same speed. The bow has been designed 
for reduced buoyancy in forward positions, meaning that, 
when Topaz Zenith encounters a wave, she slices smoothly 
through it, rather than riding over the top, and thus 
maintaining the speed she has already built up. 
Topaz Zenith is the first of two (to date) vessels, built to 
the specifications of Topaz Z class for crew boats. In Topaz 
Zenith’s case, sea trials have demonstrated that she can 
achieve a top speed of 32knots – making her, Nicocraft 
claims, the fastest crew transfer boat to hit the UAE so far 
– and her waterjet-based propulsive arrangement adds the 
bonus of increased manoeuvrability, as well as assisting in 
slashing overall vessel noise and working out to be more 
efficient, environmentally sound and safe. Topaz Marine 
also claims that the fuel savings realised by Topaz Zenith 
are superior to those of conventional catamarans, and 
“cannot be matched” by monohull vessels. 
Other safety features include the addition of an 
electronic chart display information system (ECDIS), a 
night vision camera and a Dacon scoop, which enables the 
vessel to double up as a rescue / patrol boat and as a safety 
standby vessel, should the need arise. Again, this reflects 
the current trend for maximising the possible uses to 
which modern-day wind farm support vessels can be put. 
In terms of capacities, Topaz Zenith can handle up to 
10,000litres of fuel oil, divided evenly between two 
integral aluminium tanks; 5000litres of fresh water, split 
evenly between two non-integral aluminium tanks; and 
1000litres of sullage. She boasts a deck load capacity of 
10tonnes, a deck loading rate of 3tonnes per m
2, and her 
deck area covers 53m
2, with mounting for a 20ft ISO 
container. Since being delivered, Topaz Zenith has been 
accompanied by a sister ship, Topaz Zephyr, which is 
currently operating in Qatar.

S
wede Ship Marine has maintained its tradition of 
designing and constructing high quality search and 
rescue (SAR) vessels, with the launch and delivery, in 
2011, of Uni Kragerö, the first in a new series of rescue 
craft, bound for deployment by Redningsselskapet, the 
Norwegian Sea Rescue Society. Built jointly by Swede 
Ship Marine and Swede Ship Composite, the 13.6m loa 
craft is intended to assist Redningsselskapet’s operations 
across the Norwegian coastline, focusing on a cluster of 
more than 60 different harbours. 
Built to a weight-optimised, carbon-fibre sandwich 
design, Uni Kragerö was developed to meet 
Redningsselskapet’s specific requirements for a vessel 
operated by voluntary crew, not only for SAR duties, 
but also for assistance with tasks such as fire-fighting, 
towing and medical transportation. One of these 
requirements has centred on ensuring a low wake wash 
and low lightweight for the vessel, in order to optimise 
energy and efficiency for a craft of this size and high 
speed. Apart from providing thermal insulation, the 
sandwich construction grants Uni Kragerö a good 
inherent floatability and, coupled with her fender, 
constitutes more than half of her overall displacement, 
as well as providing protection in rough weather 
conditions, and in case of incidents of beaching and 
unexpected, emergency towing requirements. The 
vessel has been scantled according to class society Det 
Norske 
Veritas’ 
(DNV’s) 
HSLC-R2 
Patrol 
specifications, with 6.5g vertical acceleration. 
Uni Kragerö’s wheelhouse has been flexibly 
mounted to her hull, resulting in low noise levels for the 
crew’s convenience, and the wheelhouse also features 
four fully damped crew seats and room for either four 
seated passengers, or one passenger on a stretcher. 
Below deck, there is space for up to seven seated 
passengers. 
The vessel utilises two drivelines with waterjets, to 
aid manoeuvrability in tight spaces, and, according to 
Swede Ship Marine, sea trials have demonstrated that, 
when operating at service speed, Uni Kragerö and her 
sisters are capable of performing a crash-stop in 13.6m, 
or one ship length. Manoeuvrability is also enhanced 
by the presence of a small Sleipner bow thruster. Twin 
VP D6-435 engines generate a power output of 320kW 
apiece, providing the vessel a cruising speed of 33knots 
at less that 140litres per hour. She can achieve a 
maximum speed of 37knots and her bollard pull 
capacity has been recorded at 3tonnes. 
In addition to this vessel order, Redningsselskapet 
also relies on a fleet of larger ships to conduct its SAR 
/ medical transport operations and so, in order to bolster 
personnel familiarity with the bridge equipment, Uni 
Kragerö and her sisters are set to feature the same 
navigational and communications equipment as their 
bigger counterparts. 
With Uni Kragerö successfully delivered, Swede 
Ship Marine estimates that her first sister vessel will be 
delivered in early 2012, and tells Significant Small 
Ships that this follow-up will be updated with a forward 
looking infrared (FLIR) camera, a Humphree 
interceptor system and a 1200litre trim tank. The 
second sister ship, earmarked for delivery in Spring 
2012, will also be lengthened somewhat and provided 
with additional features such as: larger Cummins 
engines; contra-rotating propeller thrusters by CMD 
Zeus; a Fischer Panda genset; a water monitor, with a 
capacity of 2000litres per minute; and a surface air 
diving system  for scuba operations. Small, zippy, 
energy-efficient, tough and easy to manoeuvre: we 
selected Uni Kragerö as she is definitely what coastal 
SAR service providers are coming to demand within 
this sector.

D
esign evolution continues to fuel tug production, and 
the development of Robert Allan’s RAmparts 3300 
class, building on its previous RAmparts 3200 design, 
highlights this trend.
The first in this class, Yong Gang Tuo 29, would also appear 
to make a welcome entrant to the Ningbo Port Group of 
China’s existing tug fleet; by Ningbo’s estimation, this is the 
seventh Robert Allan tug design it has taken on.  The vessel 
also constitutes yet another string to Zhenjiang Shipyard’s 
bow, the Chinese yard resembling a conveyor belt during the 
course of 2011. 
The most obvious differences between Yong Gang Tuo 29 
and her 3200 class predecessors are evident in her length – 
1m longer than the previous class – and in her increased 
bollard pull, in recognition of the increase in the number of 
larger vessels calling more frequently in the Ningbo Port 
area. 
Sea tests have demonstrated the vessel to boast a bollard 
pull of 76tonnes ahead, with a free-running speed of 
13.5knots. Her primary responsibilities will focus on ship-
docking, harbour and coastal towing, escort duties,  fire-
fighting and pollution response. 
In terms of onboard capacity, Yong Gang Tuo 29 can 
accommodate 93m
3 of fuel oil, 43m
3 of potable water, 10m
3 
of engine lube oil, 2m
3 of oily water and 3m
3 of waste oil. 
Having been configured as a twin Z-Drive ship-docking 
tug, her main propulsion is provided by twin Niigata 
8L28HX diesel engines, each rated 2206kW at 750rpm. 
Each of these engines drives a Niigata ZP-41 Z-drive unit. 
Twin diesel gen-sets, each rated at 100ekW, serve the tug’s 
electrical power needs. 
Special attention has been paid to the tug’s fendering 
arrangement. The ship handling fenders consist of an 
800mm cylindrical fender, positioned above a row of 
450mm ‘W’ block fenders., A 400mm cylindrical fender 
gifts the vessel additional protection at the main and 
forecastle deck sheer lines, and, as a bonus, aircraft tires 
complete her anti-bump armour for these sections. 
Meanwhile, the aft quarters are equally protected against 
the rigours of consistent tug work by another row of 
450mm ‘W’ block fenders. 
With a  drive towards increased onboard ergonomics on 
the agenda, Yong Gang Tuo 29’s accommodation area has 
been outfitted for crew comfort. Allowing for an 
operational crew of four, with total berthing capacity for 
up to 14 persons, the main deck houses the first two of 
four cabins, dedicated to the tug’s master and chief 
engineer, as well a spacious galley and mess areas. 
The lower deck, meanwhile, features the remaining two 
cabins, each designed to hold six crew members, and a 
dedicated heating, ventilation and air conditioning 
(HVAC) room.
