L
aunched in December 2010, the arrival of ASB 
Mutiara 5 indicated a significant shift for Asian 
Supply Base (ASB) of Malaysia. The group had honed 
itself a fine reputation as a ‘one stop centre’ for the 
country’s oil and gas sector; however, increasing activity 
within this field led to ASB taking the decision to 
expand its remit and take on the mantle of “a fully 
integrated logistics hub”, incorporating fast crew boats 
and anchor handling and special purpose vessels into its 
daily operations. 
As ASB chief executive officer Datuk Harris Tan put 
it, at a press conference hosted during the crew boat’s 
delivery: “In order to stay ahead in the global marine 
and offshore area, we need to continually improve [our] 
competitive edge. A cost-competitive and efficient 
business environment, with strong infrastructure and 
comprehensive supporting industries, will be critical…
to bring in investors.”
As this boost in oil and gas activity includes an 
upsurge in shallow water operations, ASB has therefore 
prepared itself to intensify its work in the busy Sabah 
and Sarawak waters. ASB Mutiara 5, which is being 
operated by compatriot oil major Petronas’ exploration 
and production subsidiary, Petronas Carigali, is the first 
ASB small vessel to be completed for this ongoing task. 
The vessel is powered by three Cummins engines; two 
KTA38 M2 models, which produce 993kW@1900rpm 
apiece, and one KTA50 M2, capable of generating 
1324kW@1900rpm. Ten permanent crew members 
operate the vessel, which is capable of accommodating 
and transporting 58 passenger seafarers between 
locations. 
Coatings manufacturer Jotun provided ASB Mutiara 
5’s hull and anti-corrosive protection, and the external 
deck has been coated with non-skid paint, while marine 
vinyl was incorporated into the flooring in the vessel’s 
interiors, to reduce the likelihood of slips and falls. The 
boat has a deck cargo capacity of 57tonnes, a fuel 
capacity of 56,400litres and a freshwater capacity of 
24,500litres. ASB has confirmed that further vessel 
orders and deliveries can be expected to be announced 
in 2011.

A
n unusual entry for Significant Small Ships perhaps, 
albeit an important one nonetheless, particularly in 
terms of the cost-saving impact this vessel could have on 
future training and on coming up with a solution to the 
manning crisis affecting the maritime industry as a 
whole. 
2010 saw the launch of the prototype of the 
Burchett-Robert Allan (BRAtt) training tug, the 
brainchild of Robert Allan Ltd and Burchett Marine 
Inc. The BRAtt is an ultra-compact but fully 
operational training vessel, configured as a Z-drive 
tugboat. It has Z-drive propulsion, a fully operational 
ship-handling winch, and all the necessary 
accoutrements of a fully functional harbour tug simply 
scaled down. The BRAtt also has significant 
commercial potential as a line-handling or yarding tug 
where its compact but powerful capabilities would be 
a benefit with all the functional characteristics of a 
full-size tug. It is is intended to ensure that crew 
members are fully familiarised with the latest in tug 
technology, including procedures such as harbour-ship 
handling, and the ability to efficiently handle new 
Z-Drive and Voith Schneider Propeller (VSP) tugs, for 
instance. The vessel has been scaled proportionally to 
represent full-size tugs and features a Z-Drive 
propulsion, a fully operational ship-handling winch 
and all the necessary accoutrements of a fully 
functional harbour tug – but scaled down. 
As part of their remit, the prinicipals of both Burchett 
Marine and Robert Allan decided that the BRAtt 
would have to fulfil the criteria of being large enough 
to provide a realistic simulation of operation on the 
waves; powerful enough to perform real-life work in 
training scenarios; be fully class-certifiable; and yet be 
small enough to be load-deliverable. 
The end result is a training vessel that costs less than 
a full-size tug, and which offers opportunities for 
personalised, one-on-one, intensive skills-based 
training for potential masters. However, this is not just 
a floating simulator, by any means; several clients have 
approached Burchett Marine and Robert Allan, 
expressing an interest in purchasing or hiring the 
BRAtt as a cost-effective tug for small-scale, specialised 
operations, such as drydocking, line handling and 
boom deployment. 
Four versions of the BRAtt are available; a diesel-
driven model; a hybrid BRAtt with optimised emission 
reductions options; an all-electric, emissions-free 
model; and a fuel-cell driven BRAtt. 
The BRAtt’s Z-drives are Olympic model HD3, a 
very simple and rugged Z-drive unit developed in 
British Columbia and used in the log industry.  The 
engines are Cummins model QSB5.9-230 HD, rated 
168bkW at 2600rpm, driving through a ZF Model 
280-1 gearbox with a slip-clutch feature.  This package 
is expected to develop 3630kg of bollard pull. The 
entire tug is heavily fendered with a Shibata cylindrical 
fender system for maximum resilience. An advanced 
Techsol machinery and systems control, alarm and 
monitoring system is installed, and will ultimately 
enable the real-time playback and monitoring of 
trainee actions.

arboClyde is  part of a  new generation of high 
performance vessel servicing of offshore wind 
farms. The catamaran vessel is built entirely in carbon 
composite construction technique, and she was 
constructed to Det Norske Veritas (DNV) classification 
with the following notation: DNV 1 A1 HSLC R2 
Crew.
The concept and outer appearance of the 
multipurpose vessel was developed by Fintry Marine 
Design AG, whereas Kockums AB provided the 
engineering and know-how of this catamaran. The 
23m long work catamaran, the first of a future 
production series, dubbed the carbon fibre composite 
catamaran (CarboCAT), is currently deployed in the 
Baltic 1 the first commercial offshore wind farm in 
Germany. 
At a service speed of around 25kts with 82% MCR, 
the average consumption of each MTU engine comes 
to 140litres/hr. The vessel can also transport up to 
8tonnes of material and between 12-24 technicians.
Thanks to the installation of HamiltonJet waterjets, 
the crew were pleased with the running characteristics 
and manoeuvrability of the vessel, thus successfully 
completing the almost two-year development phase of 
this new type of service boat for the offshore industry. 
The hulls and other assemblies such as the wheelhouse 
of the CarboCAT MPV were produced in negative 
moulds at Kockums AB in Sweden, part of 
ThyssenKrupp.
Kockums AB’s experience in building ships for the 
Swedish Navy, with a length of more than 70m made 
entirely of carbon, served as a major inspiration for the 
CarboCAT catamaran. They developed their own 
Kockums Vacuum Assisted Sandwich Infusion (KVASI) 
process which is also licensed to Japanese shipyard 
Universal Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) to use on 
the production of hull structures for mine 
countermeasure vessels. 
The concept, developed by Fintry Marine Design 
AG (cooperating partner of Kockums AB), is based on 
extensive experience in the deployment of boats in 
offshore wind farms. The new feature in this ship 
concept – apart from the carbon composite technology 
– is that everything is grouped on the forecastle, from 
the docking systems for various applications to the 
large crane from Palfinger Marine Systems, the 
spacious working deck, the lifeboat or the quickly 
interchangeable 3m container transport platforms for 
the technicians’ equipment. The concept for securing 
the cargo on the forecastle was copied from container 
ships and all the packing systems are secured with 
so-called twist locks.
According to Kockums and Fintry Marine, the 
vessel’s carbon fibre sandwich composite structure 
offers advantages such as: over 30% reduced structural 
weight, compared to aluminium vessels; the chance to 
realize fuel savings of up to 20%; and savings of up to 
25% when it comes to typical maintenance costs.

ana Cruz is a 28m King River-class tug that was 
built, by Fred Wahl Marine of Oregon, USA to 
ABS load line standards. The vessel’s length is 
registered at 26.8m, but the difference in the overall 
length is due to the rubber fendering. There is 
approximately 1m of fendering on the forward push 
knees and slightly less on the stern.
This vessel has a 10.9m beam and the class is 
considered to be incredibly versatile, strong and stable. 
Paul Gallagher of Foss Maritime said of this vessel: 
“The vessel is versatile to us in our business as she can 
tow a barge on a tow wire out in the ocean and then 
bring the barge into a shallow beach environment in 
2m of water. She is also set up with stern winches 
which allow Dana Cruz to push barges up the inland 
river system.”
The King River-class tugs have ice-strengthened 
hulls providing stability in the cold weather conditions 
experienced in the Alaskan waters. The tug also meets 
all known future United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards with Tier 
II-approved propulsion and auxiliary generators 
provided by Caterpillar. The vessel operates at 
1324kW – more powerful than similar vessels in her 
class that operate in the shallow-water environment of 
Alaska.
The 15.24m wheels, protected from the bottom by 
large steel ‘skegs’, are housed in a deep tunnel design to 
maximise thrust in shallow water. The anti-vibration 
engine-mounted/drive systems are in place to reduce 
unwanted stresses on the hull, which also aids in a 
more comfortable ride. There is sleeping 
accommodation for nine people. 
The vessel also has a closed circuit television 
(CCTV) camera system which offers the captain a 
view of 16 locations within and outside the vessel. All 
of her engines are new EPA tier II which have the 
lowest emission ratings available
The vessel was designed to allow Foss Maritime to 
ballast down the bow of the vessel and change the 
propellers or rudders without having to go into a 
drydock or shipyard. 
Dana Cruz has been fitted with high-tech deck 
equipment and machinery. The tug has a Markey TES-
22, single drum towing winch with 381m of 3.5m 
wire rope, and a Markey DESMG-18S single drum 
winch with 121.9m by 0.3m of synthetic line. The face 
wire winches onboard are from Nabrico and are of 
40tonnes low-profile type with 54.8m by 0.3m 
synthetic line. The vertical capstan windlass is of 
Markey VEP-12-40 with 274.3m by 0.2m stud-link 
chain type. The deck and towing winches are electric 
instead of hydraulic. There are two Stockless anchors 
with a capacity of 31,000lbs. The search lights are 
made to super critical hospital-grade silencers. The 
vessel also has an Aqua-drive anti-vibration system and 
forward looking infra-red (FLIR) navigation onboard.
The tug also features built in voids that separate the 
fuel tanks from the hull to protect the main fuel tanks 
from side impact in the event of a collision.

f the launch of MetalCraft Marine’s (MCM’s) 
FireStorm 50 fireboat raised eyebrows, then the 
September 2010 delivery of the FireStorm 70model 
really caused a stir. FireStorm 70 rightly captured 
attention for featuring a more than impressive 
maximum speed of 41kts, courtest of four CAT C-18s, 
generating 746.5kW apiece, and Hamilton 403 
waterjets. Neither was there any slouching when it came 
to the vessel’s quad Hale 8 FKF pumps, which produce 
just over 14,000 gallons per minute (gpm) at 150psi 
and 17,892gpm at 120psi. 
The high pump numbers have been attributed to the 
unique design of MCM’s ‘sea chest’, which provides a 
filtered water source to the pump while self-draining 
with the boat on plane. The monitor location is central 
for further range and is close to the centre of buoyancy, 
thus allowing the helmsman to pivot the boat around a 
high thrust load at full steam while running at low-
engine RPM. 
The hull design, based on MCM’s long-standing 
Kingston hull model, features a delta-pad centre planing 
flat, which provides the additional lift needed to offer a 
low trim angle through the pre-planing transition zone, 
or ‘hump’. As a result, the FireStorm 70 is able to carry 
its full inventory of equipment without compromising 
on speed or performance, and without draining the 
engine of excessive amounts of fuel.
However, beyond fire-fighting, the FireStorm 70 is 
also equipped to undertake chemical, biological, 
radiological and nuclear (CBRN) detection and 
prevention operations. The vessel features multiple 
monitors and detectors for gases and chemical warfare 
agents, which are displayed via a system control module 
in the pilot house. A toxic-free area (TFA), including 
the pilot house and part of the lower cabin outside the 
safe entry and decontamination area, can be rapidly 
sealed in the event of an attack, and the FireStorm 70 
offers personnel an integral breathable air system and a 
cabin gas particulate air filtration system.

Vessel’s name  ........................Greatship Maya
Owner/Operator ....Greatship Global Offshore
   Services/ GC Rieber Shipping Asia
Country  ...............................................Australia
Flag   ................................................ Singapore
Delivery date  ..............................January 2010
G
reatship Maya, which was delivered in January 
2010, is one of the few new offshore support 
vessels (OSVs) to have attained certification as a 
Special Purpose Ship under the International 
Maritime Organization (IMO) SPS Code 2008, a 
category which denotes that vessels carrying more 
than 12 special project personnel have met stringent 
standards for safety and stability. 
The 94m platform supply geotechnical vessel was 
delivered to owner Greatship Global Offshore 
Services, and then bareboat chartered to GC Rieber 
Shipping Asia and partner Bluestone Offshore, from 
the first quarter of 2010. Greatship Maya’s maiden 
expedition took place at the Australian Great Barrier 
Reef in February 2010, when a team of international 
researchers deployed the vessel at the landmark to 
determine how sudden sea-level change and climate 
change were affecting the Reef’s coral, and to collect 
coral core samples at a depth of 160m. 
Another factor that makes Greatship Maya 
significant is that, unlike a number of other standard 
platform supply vessels, she is equipped with a 
drilling unit, which is capable of operating at water 
depths of up to 1800m. She can also host real-time, 
in-situ tests from downhole or seabed mode, as well 
as conduct a wide range of geotechnical laboratory 
tests within her onboard facilities. 
The vessel  features two units of electrical-driven 
2600kW azimuth thrusters and three units of 
1050kW tunnel thrusters. As a result, this set-up 
grants her Dynamic Positioning II capability. 
Additionally, Greatship Maya has a 7m x 7m moon 
pool, and some 1000 sq m of clear deck space for the 
installation of drilling derrick, line tensioner winches, 
mud pumps, hydraulic units and various specialised 
containers for the performance of geotechnical 
services.

F
ollowing hot on the heels of her sister vessel Hai 
Yu, which was delivered in September 2009, Hai 
Jun is the 10th passenger catamaran of the SEACAT 
family designed by CMCS of Australia, and built by 
Wang Tak Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. 
The vessel is operated by Zhuhai SeaGoing 
Shipping Co, a fully-owned subsidiary of Zhuhai 
High-Speed Passenger Ferry Co, and is deployed on 
routes between Zhuhai Jiuzhou Port, Shekou, Hong 
Kong Airport, Macau Airport and local outlying 
islands within the Zhuhai region. 
Hai Jun is equipped with life saving equipment 
and four life rafts, each with a capacity for 65 
persons, as well as portable fire extinguishers, a 
fixed CO2 fire suppression system for the engine 
room, and a ‘dry-type’ passenger cabin water-spray 
protection system. All life saving equipment aboard 
the vessel has been certified by China Classification 
Society (CCS). 
In terms of reducing excessive noise and 
vibrations, the ferry was also designed with flexible 
mountings to the main engines and gearbox; flexible 
couplings fitted to the propulsion train for the 
waterjet; and isolation of the engine room from the 
passenger cabin at the main deck. As a result, Hai 
Jun records a noise level of just 70dbA inside the 
main deck passenger cabin, and less than 65dbA at 
the upper deck passenger cabin and wheelhouse. 
Currently, two more 33m catamarans are under 
construction at Wang Tak, due for delivery in 2011.

T
he 15m Iceni Spirit was specifically designed and 
built to perform crew transfers and associated 
works on offshore wind farms, currently a booming 
market within the US, Europe and many parts of Asia. 
Built with safety in mind, Iceni Spirit has been 
structurally designed to enable crew transfers in over 
2m significant wave height.  The vessel is being 
deployed at the Walney offshore wind farms in the Irish 
Sea, which are currently under construction 
approximately 15km off Walney Island, Cumbria. 
Upon completion, the wind farms will feature 51 
turbines with a total capacity of 367.2mw.
The vessel’s one-level wheelhouse was developed to be 
a spacious, comfortable environment for her passengers, 
containing individual, air sprung adjustable suspension 
seats for up to 12 wind farm technicians. The windows 
offer forward views, in order to limit seasickness while 
the 25knots vessel is in transit. The wheelhouse also 
features a small galley with hot and cold running water, 
tea and coffee, and meal-making facilities. Eight of the 
seats come equipped with tables and dedicated areas for 
kit bag storage. Toilet facilities are provided at the rear of 
the wheelhouse with access from the aft deck. 
Below deck is a designated heated storage area, 
accessible via the wheelhouse, where sensitive spare 
parts and equipment can be stored. According to 
Iceni Marine Services, which took delivery of Iceni 
Spirit in March 2010, the boat has been equipped 
with a fuel delivery system, which means she can 
refuel portable generators on the wind turbine 
generators and sub-stations after the crew transfers 
have taken place. The vessel's main diesel tanks have 
been increased in size and a pump capapable of 
achieving a 40m head of pressure fitted below the 
main deck. A 30m hose reeel and digital flow metre 
to log all fuel transfers are mounted at the bow of 
the vessel.
The vessel has a pod hull, for operating in shallow 
water and where grounding is required, and is fitted 
with Scania DI12 engines, each capable of 
generating an output of 460kW, and UltraJet 452 
waterjets. 
Iceni Spirit’s spacious foredeck also allows for a 
large stable working platform, with up to 2000kg 
weight carrying capacity. Included at the bow is a 
hydraulic jet wash for cleaning access ladders and 
mono piles. The fenders are the MK IV type 
specially developed for wind farm applications and 
work in conjunction with a strong box section bow 
platform that has a sprung fastening to provide extra 
'give' when landing. The bow aslo features a built 
out 'nib' that fits between the boat landing piles, all 
helping to keep the boat in place against the tower. 
The nib also provides a shorter step off distance to 
the ladder of the wind turbine tower.

S
ignificant Small Ships has selected Boston Towing 
& Transportation’s newcomer tug Independence 
based on a number of innovative vessel features, 
reportedly making this unit a ‘first’ for the US-built 
tug market. Designed by Robert Allan, one of the first 
notable considerations was to equip Independence 
with controllable pitch propellers (CP props). Its 
unique and innovative RAstar hull form, intended 
for service in the exposed North  Atlantic region off the 
coast of New England, USA.
The 39.1m long tug produces 3970kW from two 
16v4000 series MTU engines driving Rolls-Royce 
Z-drives with CP props. These CP props can be 
partially feathered, meaning that a fire pump can run 
directly off the front end of the engine, after being 
engaged by an electro-hydraulic clutch, while the CP 
prop can still be utilised to manoeuvre the tug, 
reducing required engine power. Sea trial results 
highlighted an increase in vessel speed and enhanced 
power, resulting in a 73.5tonne bollard pull. 
Independence is equipped with FiFi Class 1 fire 
pumps, which produce a water cannon range of 130m 
at 39,750 litres per minute. According to Derecktor, 
the aforementioned optimisation of power in the 
propulsion system enables the pumps to be driven off 
the main engines, thereby reducing both the weight 
and cost of the dedicated pump engines typically 
found on other FiFi Class 1 vessels and boats. 
Another notable feature is the use of carbon fibre 
drive shafts connecting to the vessel’s Z-drives, 
installed primarily to reduce the volume of required 
vessel maintenance, subsequently slashing vessel 
downtime rates. The presence of carbon fibre shafts 
also help to decrease the number of required pedestal 
bearings, according to Bill Skinner, marine 
superintendent at Boston Towing & Transportation, 
who acted as project manager on Independence. He 
said: “Two or less bearings may be used as opposed to 
typically five in an installation of this size. Two men 
can remove and carry a carbon fibre drive shaft in and 
out of the boat...that’s obviously not the case with a 
steel shaft.”
The aft deck on Independence is built to 
accommodate three 20ft containers, while an Effer 
hydraulic deck crane, rated at 10tonnes and with 7.6m 
extension, is responsible for handling container and 
cargo movements, as well as deployment of the vessel’s 
rescue boat. 
An estimated 1065m of piping, under the deck and 
in the forward bulwarks, were installed to handle the 
vessel’s deck heating system – a crucial consideration, 
given the ice the vessel’s crew can expect to encounter 
during winter activities off the coast of Massachusetts. 
Other details for enhanced crew comfort include 21 
onboard heated windows.

ompleted, from contract to delivery, in just 11 
months, Laboe is the first of a six-vessel pilot boat 
order placed with Swedish shipbuilder Dockstavarvet, 
a specialist in the manufacture of aluminium pilot and 
patrol craft. Ordered for coastal use by the German 
government, the 16.8m x 5.2m Laboe features two 
Volvo-Penta D16 main engines, each delivering 
368kW at 1800rpm. Each engine drives fixed pitch 
propellers through 80mm SS shafts and, combined 
with Twin Disc MGX-5145 gearboxes, the end result 
is an impressive propulsion package. 
At full load displacement of 33.3tonnes and 90% of 
CSR, Laboe can achieve speeds of 20knots, resulting in 
the vessel’s notable low rate of fuel consumption, 
which stands at approximately 7.5litres per nautical 
mile. The vessel arrangement is laid out with a raised 
wheelhouse with ‘round-the-horizon’ visibility for the 
crew. In order to limit noise, the deckhouse has been 
resiliently mounted, resulting in a noise level of under 
65db(A) at 90% maximum continuous revolution 
(MCR). 
A 20kW Kabola boiler provides Laboe’s heating, 
combined with waste heat from the engines’ fresh 
water circuits and back-up from a 9kW electro boiler 
when the vessel is shore-connected. The electrical 
system is based on 24 V DC for essential services 
supplied from two 140 A generators on the main 
engines. The 400/230 V AC system is supplied by a 
10kW Fischer-Panda diesel generator or shore 
connection and serves five large heated windows, the 
aircon system, domestic services and back-up battery 
charging for five battery banks.
Furuno has supplied Laboe’s navigation and 
communications package, which incorporates two 
12kW radars, type FAR-2117, with 17” and 19” 
displays, as well as two TECDIS plotter systems, GPS 
compass, dGPS receiver, autopilot, echo sounder, AIS, 
wind data and camera systems.

ransviking, a joint venture operator formed from 
an alliance between Rederi Transatlantic AB from 
Norway and Viking Supply AS from Sweden, took 
delivery of the 85.2m long, 22m wide anchor handler 
and tug supply vessel LOKE VIKING  in May 2010, 
having ordered the vessel for operation in the North 
Sea, off the coast of Greenland and, later on, in the 
Norwegian offshore fields and close to the Arctic circle. 
LOKE VIKING has been equipped with four MAK 
diesel engines, working on two shaft lines with Berg CP 
propellers with nozzles. In total, the MAK engines 
deliver 14,000kW at 600rpm. 
During the vessel’s sea trials, she achieved a top bollard 
pull of 227tonnes, apparently some 17tonnes more than 
designer Vik & Sandvik and builder Zamakona Yards 
had anticipated for the tug. The maximum speed 
achieved during the trials was recorded at 17.7knots. In 
addition, LOKE VIKING has been fitted with two 
tunnel thrusters aft and three thrusters in the bow. 
A Rolls-Royce waterfall-type winch, featuring a brake 
holding power of 525tonnes, serves the vessel’s towage 
requirements. In addition to the winch, the vessel also 
boasts aft towing pins and karm forks, fitted ahead of 
the double drum stern roller. The vessel also features 
two Rolls-Royce fully automated sliding handling 
cranes on each side of the aft work deck, for enhanced 
crew safety when handling mooring gear and anchors. 
During construction, the vessel was upgraded to 
FireFighting (FiFi) notation 1 and II. FiFi gear was 
supplied by FFS and includes two monitors installed on 
the deck above the wheelhouse, each featuring a capacity 
of 3600m
3/h. Each monitor is 170m in length and 
100m in height, and they are both fed by a pump with 
a capacity of 4000m
3/h.

A
s international demand for alternative energy 
sources grows, with offshore wind turbine farm 
installations cropping up thick and fast in Europe, the 
US and, now, Southeast Asia, demand for specialised 
vessels capable of servicing these energy farms has also 
sharply increased. The delivery of Natalia Bekker, built 
for stationary deployment at the BARD Offshore 1 
wind farm, situated in the North Sea, could not have 
come at a more opportune time. 
Natalia Bekker was constructed to Abeking & 
Rasmussen’s small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) 
design specifications. The design enables the vessel to 
sail in practically every sea state without big influence 
on speed, resulting in a very small rate of motion 
sickness for people on board during all transit and 
operating modes. The vessel can stay at sea in nearly all 
weather conditions providing much higher availability 
of vessel during the year in coastal and offshore 
operating areas compared to conventional vessels of 
same or bigger size.
By securing her bow against two dolphin pipes, the 
vessel is designed to moor up next  to the turbine, 
creating a safe zone for boarding and disembarkation at 
the turbines in wave heights of up to 2.5m – thereby 
enabling engineers and servicepersons to move safely 
around the turbines comprising the farm, without 
incurring costly helicopter expenses. 
The vessel features two 10-cylinder MTU Series 2000 
M72 engines with a total of 1800kW. She is also 
equipped with a full diesel-electric propulsion plant, 
developed especially to react faster than comnventional 
controlled pitch propeller plants, for optimum 
manoeuvrability, even in the foulest of  weather 
conditions. 
A special rubber fender system was also installed on 
the bow, to further dampen ship movement and to 
enable the vessel to press up securely against the ascent 
system on the wind turbine’s foundation. As a result, in 
the immediate disembarkation area, the vessel only 
moves a few centimetres during this phase of operations. 
Natalia Bekker can accommodate up to 12 engineers 
and a permanent presence of two to three crew 
members, who swap duties every two to three weeks. 
The vessel is fully compliant with International 
Maritime Organization regulations and has been fully 
classified by Germanischer Lloyd.

N
ormand Ranger is a new type VS 490 anchor 
handling tug supply vessel with a dramatic past; 
originally under construction at Kamsund Maritime 
Service, that yard’s bankruptcy led to the vessel being 
transferred to Ulstein Verft, which delivered Normand 
Ranger in April 2010. 
The vessel is 91m long, 22m wide, has an interior for 
58 persons and a deadweight of approximately 
4500tonnes. Ulstein reported that she features a 
bollard pull of 287tonnes. 
To ensure safe anchor handling operations on deck, 
Normand Ranger was equipped with a Triplex multi 
deck handler (MHD) and an Odim anchor recovery 
frame (ARF).  The deck also features two knuckle 
boom shipboard/harbour cranes, each with an 
outreach of between three and 16m, and capable of 
handling 6tonnes. 
Two main engines each produce 8000kW at 
750rpm, while two generator engines produce 
2199kW at 1800rpm apiece. The vessel is currently 
being operated by Solstad Offshore in the North Sea, 
as that particular market starts to bounce back – good 
going for a vessel which, 18 months ago, lay half-
completed with doubts over its future.

elivered to the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue, 
Redningsselskapet, 
following 
delivery 
in 
September 2010, the 24.7m aluminium craft ODIN 
has been deployed in the north of Norway, where she is 
responsible for undertaking search and rescue (SAR) 
operations within this harsh climate. 
ODIN produces a top speed close to 30knots, features 
a towing capacity of 22.5tonnes and has an operating 
range of more than 600nm. As the crew live and work 
onboard, operating from four fully damped seats and a 
four-person bench in the wheelhouse, much care has 
been taken to eliminate noise and vibration as much as 
possible. According to Swede Ship Marine, even when 
ODIN is operating at a high speed of 25knots, the 
flexible mounted wheelhouse produces less than 60dB 
worth of noise. For the deckboat in front of the 
wheelhouse, Swede Ship Marine has also provided a new 
davit to ensure quick and safe launches without any 
line-of-sight obstructions from the wheelhouse. 
Fully classified according to Det Norske Veritas 
(DNV)  +1A1 LC E0 PATROL R1, ODIN features two 
1440kW MTU engines and Helseth controlled pitch 
(CP) propellers, the latter boasting a towing capacity of 
25tonnes with towing hook, or 16tonnes via the vessel’s 
special towing winch arrangement. 
The vessel is equipped with high-end medical 
solutions, including an ambulance treatment bench 
with oxygen equipment, advanced first aid equipment 
and a defibrillator, to assist with treatment of casualties 
taken onboard. In terms of SAR-specific equipment, the 
vessel also features a remote-operated fire monitor with 
a capacity of more than 2000litres/min and salvage 
pumps with a combined capacity of 3500litres/min.

easuring in at 46.7m in length, 15.5m in 
breadth, drawing 7.3m and displacing 2,800 
metric tonnes when fully loaded, OSG Vision was one 
of the larger new tugs to catch the sector’s eye in 
2010. She operates in conjunction with the 353,000 
barrel capacity, 199.6m barge OSG 350, which was 
purpose built for lightering operations. 
To keep the tug and barge safely mated, OSG Vision 
has adopted Intercontinental Engineering 
Manufacturing Corporation’s (Intercon) wave tooth 
connection system, which incorporates the largest 
interconnection helmets available at 64” in diameter. 
These enable a continuously variable amount of 
vertical travel, keeping the tug in the barge’s notch 
during various ballast conditions or tempestuous 
weather – at sea heights of just over 3m during 
lightering operations, and approximately 7.5m when 
transiting the open sea at full speeds. Alone, OSG 
Vision was developed to operate in seas greater than 
12m. 
The vessel utilises two Wärtsilä 9L32, 4500kW 
engines that turn 4190mm-diameter controllable 
pitch propellers pushing water through high-
efficiency Rice Kort nozzles and a triple shutter 
rudder system. In total, this permits OSG Vision to 
achieve a service speed of 12.5knots when the barge 
is fully loaded. Fuel consumption is estimated at 
32mt per day, resulting in less refuelling time 
between ports of call.

esigned to handle a variety of operational tasks, 
from anchor and tanker handling and vessel 
towage to pollution control, search and rescue and 
fire-fighting, the near 50m loa, Cheoy Lee-built PB 
Karepo appears to stand out as much for its versatility 
as its power output. Her launch also highlights 
Wärtsilä’s increasing involvement in the smaller ship 
sector, the company’s Singapore division having 
designed the vessel on behalf of client PB Towage. 
The vessel features two Yanmar 6EY26 diesels, each 
developing 1920kW at 750rpm, driving two Berg 
BCP690 250mm controllable pitch propellers in 
nozzles via Reintjes LAF 2346L gearboxes with a 3.5:1 
reduction ratio. The vessel’s maneuverability has also 
been enhanced by the inclusion of a 320kW 
Nakashima TCT-105 electric bow thruster, while three 
Caterpillar 350kW three phase C18 generators supply 
all onboard power requirements via Teresaki switch 
and distribution boards. For extra back-up, an 82kW, 
air cooled Caterpillar C4.4 serves as a stand-by.
Keeping the vessel well equipped and fuelled has 
been another priority on the designer’s part. PB Karepo 
boasts a fuel capacity of 500m
3 and a potable water 
capacity of 240tonnes, to keep her 30-man crew going 
during lengthy or complicated operations, and she is 
fitted out with a rescue boat and workboat. One of the 
vessel’s notable arrangements has been an elevated 
bridge, providing 360° visibility to crew. Control 
stations are both forward and aft facing and each 
features a Bostrom helm seat. 
Singapore-based equipment manufacturer Plimsoll 
arranged the vessel’s towing gear, which includes an 
anchor handling / towing winch, anchor windlass / 
towing winch and two rope storage reels, as well as 
shark jaw, towing pins, tugger winches and capstans. 
Her deck crane, meanwhile, was supplied by Palfinger. 
Like her identical sisterships in the four-vessel series, 
PB Karepo is of all-steel construction and was built to 
ABS class, with the notation  A1, (E), AMS, 
Towing Service – confirming the standards credentials 
one would expect from a vessel with such thorough 
input from leading names in the fields of technology 
and propulsion.

Delivery date .............................. August 2010
P
olarcus Asima is a high ice class, 12 steamer 3D/4D 
Arctic-ready seismic survey vessel, delivered by 
Drydocks World of Dubai, UAE, in August 2010. The 
vessel was built to the Ulstein SX134 design, 
incorporating features such as the patented Ulstein 
X-BOW double hull. 
The vessel has been certified to ICE-1A standards, 
the seismic vessel sector-specific notation confirming 
that a ship or boat is qualified to operate safely within 
an Arctic environment. Polarcus Asima also carries Det 
Norske Veritas (DNV) Dynamic Positioning Class 2 
notation (DYNPOS-AUTR), which allows for 
continued safe steerage of the vessel in case of engine 
or propeller failure. 
Meanwhile, backed by DNV’s COMF-V(3) 
notation, the vessel benefits from a distinct reduction 
in noise and vibration, creating a quieter and safer 
working environment for the crew. 
Polarcus has also drawn attention to Polarcus Asima’s 
green credentials, pointing out her diesel electric 
propulsion, high specification catalytic converters and 
the presence of an onboard bilge water cleaning 
system, the latter of which complies with the stringent 
DNV CLEAN DESIGN notation.

H
aving already made an impression with its 
Interceptor 42 pilot vessel design, Safehaven 
Marine unveiled the first of its brand new Interceptor 
48 range in September 2010, with the delivery of the 
14.7m Quinoa. 
The Interceptor 48 model relies on the familiar deep 
V hull type associated with Interceptor 42, only 
capable of being powered by engines of 12 litre 
capacity. It can match the speed of the Intereceptor 42 
despite an increased displacement with the same 
power. 
Indeed, Safehaven accredits the Interceptor 48’s 
increased waterline length with providing a greater 
degree of seakeeping – an essential factor, given the 
rough weather and sea conditions that the Bordeaux 
pilots have to deal with.This includes challenging and 
at times dangerous seas at the entrance to the Harbour 
where big Atlantic swells from the Bay of Biscay meet 
the strong 3-4knot ebb tide from the Gironde River 
and rage with violence causing breaking seas at the Bar 
that reach over 10m in height during winter months. 
The pilot vessel is expected to be able to navigate the 
Bar safely in up to 5m wave heights. As a consequence 
a fundamental requirement by the Port was for a pilot 
vessel with very high levels of sea keeping.
 An important part of the design brief was for the 
Quinoa to be fully self righting in the event of capsize 
by virtue of her high buoyancy superstructure and 
consequently the vessel has been built with numerous 
features such as automatically closing air vents, 
15mm thick windows and watertight cockpit doors. 
In addition the superstructure's forward windows are 
aft sloping to minimise pressure loadings when 
taking green seas over the bow (a fairly regular 
occurrence due to the extreme conditions in which 
she operates).
The inclusion of a large and spacious forward cabin 
is achieved by virtue of having her engines installed 
further aft under the main cabin, where they are 
subject to less loadings and accelerations in rough seas, 
and are quickly removed in the event of failure through 
hatches incorporated in the main cabin sole and cabin 
roof. The forward cabin on Quinoa features bunk 
berths allowing the pilots to rest and relax comfortably 
during transits at night time, and provides increased 
seating capacity that can be utilised in an emergency, 
or when additional passenger seating is required. 
Quinoa is fitted with Safehaven's unique pilot boarding 
ladder design, improving safety for pilots when 
boarding but causing minimum obstruction to 
visibility.
 The increased waterline length also enables the 
engines to operate at only 70% of maximum power to 
achieve an operational speed of 22knots, thereby 
resulting in engine longevity and savings on fuel costs. 
Quinoa is powered by two Iveco C13 engines at a 
continuous rating of 382.5kW and Twin Disc 5114 
Quick Shift gearboxes, turning 28” diameter 4-blade 
propellers. When it comes to limiting noise and 
vibration, the inclusion of a foam-sandwiched deck 
and the design of the wheelhouse have led to low 
onboard noise readings of approximately 74db, when 
the vessel is moving at 22knots. The vessel’s 300mm 
diameter rubber fendering, supplied by Ocean 3, 
grants her additional protection.

M
/V Saaremaa is a double-ended car and passenger 
ferry with capacity to carry 600 passengers, 
approximately 400 of whom are seated inside. The 
vessel can accommodate approximately 150 cars, or 12 
trailers and 140 cars, on the shelter deck, and 
approximately 55 cars on the main deck. 
The ferry is operating in Estonian domestic waters 
and her double-ended design reduces fuel consumption 
significantly, by sparing the vessel from the need to 
turn when in harbour. The contra-rotating propellers 
also reduce fuel consumption while ensuring high 
manoeuvrability, even at low speeds. 
In harsh, winter conditions, the ferry is capable of 
operating in ice of thicknesses up to 70cm, and brash 
ice with an approximate thickness of 1.5m. Attention 
has also been spent on preventing the potentially 
harmful effects of vibration on Saaremaa’s electrical 
and electronic equipment, due to ice breaking. As the 
ferry is operating in low ambient conditions, all spaces 
containing installations exposed to frost and humidity 
are kept well insulated and heated. 
For lower weight and higher resistance, the ferry’s 
high tensile steel is mainly used in the underwater hull 
structure. The deckhouse, including the bridge deck 
and wheelhouse, is aluminium-built. The pump room 
and two engine rooms are arranged midship, while a 
thruster room is situated at each end of the ferry.
 Four ‘low NOx’ diesel generators produce the 
energy for the two azimuth thrusters. These diesel 
generators are located in two separate engine rooms, 
one featuring a 6-cylinder, the other an 8-cylinder, 
engine. The diesel-generators can run on gas oil, 
marine diesel oil or biodiesel. 
The ferry has been built with a closed cargo space on 
main deck for personal cars (max. height 2.35 m) and 
one open cargo deck on shelter deck for cars and 
trailers (max. height 5.0 m). She is equipped with bow 
visors at each of her ends, and hydraulically operated 
watertight hatches in the shelter deck provide access to 
the main deck.
The accommodation and passenger areas on the 
saloon deck are wheelchair-user friendly and include: a 
passenger lounge, two lifts, three stairways, 42sq.m of 
shopping facilities, a cafeteria and rest rooms. The 
evacuation stations are arranged on the saloon deck 
with rafts connected for dry evacuation of the vessel, in 
case of emergency. 
Meanwhile, facilities for officers and crew are 
arranged on the crew deck and bridge deck containing 
13 cabins (7 single and 6 double).

010 saw Austal complete and deliver six high 
speed, 30m patrol vessel sisterships for the Trinidad 
and Tobago Coast Guard, the first of these orders 
being Scarlet Ibis. Like her sisters, Scarlet Ibis has been 
classed by Det Norske Veritas, which has also provided 
classification for vessels built by Austal for the Armed 
Forces of Malta. 
The patrol vessels are being deployed to enhance 
maritime security in the Caribbean region, having 
been designed for superior sea keeping and operation 
in conditions up to Sea State 6. The deep ‘V’ shape of 
the chine monohull delivers a draft of only 1.5m. 
Scarlet Ibis’ propulsion is provided by two Kamewa 
56A3 waterjets, featuring advanced mixed flow pump 
geometry. Austal opted for waterjet technology citing 
higher speeds, lower fuel consumption and the ability 
to operate in shallow, often debris-laden, water with a 
high level of precision at either high or low speeds. The 
vessel delivers a maximum speed of 40knots and a 
range of 1000nm (at 10knots). Two MTU 16V 2000 
M92 diesel engines provide the backing power, each 
producing 1630kW at 2450rpm. 
The vessel’s fly bridge features a control station, 
equipment monitoring facilities, two general-purpose 
lockers, a signal light and access to the vessel’s PA 
system and main bridge intercom. Scarlet Ibis’ 
primary weapon, a 20mm cannon, is mounted on the 
foredeck and supported by its own dedicated 
magazine locker below, while the secondary weapons 
– fixed mount 0.5 calibre machine guns -  are situated 
port and starboard of the fly bridge. The vessel is also 
equipped with a 4.8m rigid inflatable boat, which 
can be launched and recovered via a hydraulic 
knuckle boom crane. 
Her bridge features a Northrop Grumman integrated 
bridge system (IBS), utilising Sperry Marine 
Visionmaster FT navigation technology, such as ‘X’ 
Band radar system. Communications are available to 
the bridge watch team courtesy of an HF and V/UHF 
package provided by CEA Technologies.

esigned and built by Alnmaritec, the 14m long x 
5m beam Shi Hua Gang Yi Hao is fitted with twin 
Volvo D9 engines,  each generating approximately 
312kW, while Hamilton 322 waterjets provide Shi 
Hua Gang Yi Hao’s means of propulsion, resulting in 
speeds of up to 21knots, with an impressive degree of 
manouevrability . 
Built as part of the popular Wave Provider class, this 
high speed planing catamaran's hull is based upon the 
‘Wave Train’ form. This is an asymmetric catamaran 
hull form which has fine forward sections developing 
into medium deadrise single chine form aft. This 
allows the vessel to plane for high speed operations, 
granting stability and reportedly favourable sea 
keeping characteristics, and with waterjet drive it 
offers a shallow draft.
The aluminium vessel is currently being deployed by 
oil major PetroChina, and serving a refinery in Dalian, 
in the eastern part of the country. 
She is built to carry and deploy a range of pollution 
control gear including a spray dispersant pump with 
extendable spray arms, skimmer oil recovery systems 
and a towable oil storage bladder as well as a host of 
other equipment. She has seating for eight passengers 
in the comfortable wheelhouse as well as for three crew 
together with a small WC. She has a very large working 
deck with a roll over stern together with removable 
hand rails and a substantial tow post. The deck has a 
number of lashing and support points to accommodate 
the oil spill response equipment and this can readily be 
loaded or deployed using the Palfinger 6.5tonne metre 
hydraulic knuckle boom crane.
Her onboard oil emergency response kit includes a 
small arsenal of Elastec American Marine pollution 
control equipment, including dispersant spray arms, a 
hydraulically powered oil recovery skimmer and 
pump, steam cleaning equipment, a hot pressure 
system and an oil storage bladder.

T
he summer of 2010 saw Keppel Nantong shipyard 
deliver the RAmpage 5000 design tug Smit Angola 
to Smit Shipping Singapore, part of the SMIT 
International group. The RAmpage class of offshore 
support tug designs were developed to address a 
perceived gap in the market for high-performance 
towing and anchor-handling tugs for critical offshore 
terminal and oil-field support duties. Filling a gap 
between a full offshore supply vessel and a harbour/
coastal tug. Initial sea trial results yielded some very 
satisfactory results for both yard and operator; the 
49.5m long vessel was demonstrated to be capable of 
achieving a bollard pull in excess of 90tonnes, thanks 
partly to the inclusion of twin Wärtsilä 8L26 2720kW 
engines. She is currently engaging, as her name 
suggests, in explorations off the coast of Angola, 
Africa, under the management of SMIT Amandla 
Marine. 
A pair of nozzled Rolls-Royce controllable pitch 
propellers provide Smit Angola’s propulsion, providing 
208rpm, while two Stamford alternators generate 
700kW at 1800rpm apiece. In fact, Rolls-Royce has 
left its indelible stamp on the vessel: her deck 
machinery includes the manufacturer’s TW 1500/1500 
F aft towing winch, TW 2500/500/40 F forward 
towing winch, CH 50 E capstan and two MW 100 F 
mooring winches. In addition, the deck area boasts a 
4.55m x 2.2m diameter stern roller, rated 200tonnes 
safe working load (SWL) and a Karm Fork and tow 
pins, rated 300tonnes SWL.

uilt to Damen Offshore Patrol Vessel 950 
specifications, the 66m loa Stefan Cel Mare was 
delivered in September 2010 and has been patrolling 
Romanian and EU coastal areas under the auspices of 
Romania’s General Inspectorate of the Border Police. 
Her home port is located in Constanta, and her 
construction was supported by Schengen funding. 
Equipped with a state-of-the-art surveillance radar, an 
electro-optic (EO) / infra-red (IR) system, a 12.7mm 
turret gun and a 6.7m fast rescue craft, Stefan Cel Mare’s 
prime objectives are Romanian border control and 
security. Capable of maintaining a top speed of 
20.6knots, the vessel runs on two MTU 16V 4000 M73 
main engines. 
In addition, she is fitted with three MAN D2855 
LXE30 generator sets, each of which produces 176kWe 
at 1500rpm, and can also rely on a back-up MAN 
D0823LE201 in case of emergencies, the latter 
producing 80kWe at 1500rpm. 
Stefan Cel Mare accommodates 19 crew members with 
a designated passenger capacity of six, but has enough 
room inside to hold 75 persons, in the event of a serious 
incident or criminal attack, or any incident necessitating 
the safe evacuation and transportation of civilians. 
On the deck, Stefan Cel Mare makes use of an electric-
hydraulic mooring winch with two warping heads, and 
two electric capstans, each of which has a pull capacity 
of 5tonnes. Her tanks have the capacities to carry: 69m

nstantly recognisable as a Robert Allan design, 
Svitzer Pembroke was designed to perform a wide 
range of tasks, including ship-handling, LNG carrier 
escort, ocean towing and salvage and anchor handling 
duties.  The RAstar class hull form is intended to 
ensure high standards for escort towing capability and 
superior sea-keeping in the heavy sea conditions 
encountered during her operations at the Milford 
Haven Terminal, UK. 
General Electric has provided two 16V228 diesel 
engines, each rated 3052kW at 1050rpm, and each 
driving a Schottel model SRP 3030 controllable pitch 
Z-drive unit. As a result, Svitzer Pembroke currently 
enjoys a recorded bollard pull of 105tonnes. Svitzer 
Marine estimates that her indirect steering and braking 
forces are 115tonnes steering and 150tonnes braking 
at 10knots. 
Meanwhile, a pair of Cummins model K19-
CP390DM/5 diesel gen-sets provide the vessel’s 
electrical power. Each Cummins unit is rated 390kW 
at 1500rpm. In addition, Svitzer Pembroke benefits 
from the presence of a Cummins model 
6B-CS74DM/5 harbour gen-set, rated 74kW at 
1500rpm. Each of the two fire pumps is rated 1430 
m3/hour. 
To facilitate her ship-handling and escort work, 
Svitzer Pembroke’s fore deck is equipped with a Rolls-
Royce model TW 2250/850/AW 26U2 H combination 
hawser winch and anchor windlass, the winch 
featuring the capacity for 250m worth of 76mm 
diameter towline. An impressive set-up comprising a 
double drum; a hydraulic Rolls-Royce towing /anchor-
handling winch; a 3m long,  1500mm diameter stern 
roller; a hydraulic knuckle-boom type deck crane, 
boasting 17tonne-metre capacity; and tow pins and 
shark jaws, graces the aft working deck. 
As well as visually reproducing Robert Allan’s 
distinctive design, the vessel has also incorporated a 
number of the designer’s common tug features. These 
include the resilient mounting of the main engines, 
isolation of exhaust system components and the 
comprehensive use of visco-elastic floating floor 
systems throughout the vessel, in order to severely 
limit noise and vibration. 
As an example, the galley has recorded a volume of 
just under 67dBA, while the crew cabins are subject to 
a  maximum of 58.6dBA. All in all, Svitzer Pembroke 
provides a comfortable and smooth-running 
environment, while packing the punch to engage in 
heavy duty towing and escorting work.

N
amed after the number of firefighters who lost 
their lives in New York City on 11 September 
2001, the delivery of the fireboat Three Forty Three 
was always going to be an emotional occasion. 
Delivered to the Fire Department of the City of New 
York at the tail end of 2010, the vessel’s responsibility 
is to engage in fire-fighting and rescue operations, as 
well as to respond to any potential or actual chemical, 
biological, radiological or nuclear incidents, within 
New York Harbour, including the New Jersey shore. 
Designed by Robert Allan Ltd. of Vancouver, B.C. 
(under the direction of Ken Harford, P. Eng. as the 
Principal-in-Charge, and Derek Noon, project 
manager) Three Forty Three is the first of two new 
fireboats to this design to be built at Eastern 
Shipbuilding Inc. The contract award included 
complete engineering and design of the boats from 
initial concept through detailed engineering design 
and included a comprehensive value engineering 
process. The company’s scope also included the 
support of the FDNY through every stage of major 
component procurement and the shipbuilding 
contract award. 
The fireboats are designed with a low-wake, and 
have a total pumping capacity in excess of 50,000gpm 
at 150psi. The powering, seakeeping, and wake 
generation characteristics of the semi-displacement 
hull form were all verified in an extensive model-
testing program.
The fire-fighting equipment for the new fireboats is 
all supplied by Fire-Fighting Systems (FFS) of Norway.
The propulsion configuration of the RAnger 4200 
Class fireboats was determined after extensive 
evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of numerous 
options, including Z-drives and waterjets. Given the 
imposed draught limitations as well as the speed and 
fire-pump drive requirements, the final solution was a 
quadruple-screw, controllable-pitch propeller system. 
The four main engines are MTU Model 12V-4000 
M70, each rated 2240bhp (1671kW) at 2000 rpm. 
The engines each drive a Hundested CP propeller, 
1778mm in diameter through Hundested model 
CPG(H) 120(L) speed-reducing gearboxes, and also 
drive the four main fire pumps through front end 
PTOs. Station-keeping during fire-fighting is 
enhanced by the incorporation of a Wesmar model 
“Vortex V2-26” tunnel type bow thruster, driven by an 
electric motor.
Other onboard features include a Furuno navaid and 
equipment suite and a a state-of-the-art power 
generation system, comprising two Northern Lights, 
235kW diesel gen-sets, supplying 460V, 3 phase, 
60Hz power to the entire ship. The auto-start feature 
prevents anything more than a minor interruption in 
primary power, and in addition there is a 
comprehensive UPS system for all critical machinery 
control and communication functions.

L
aunched to coincide with German ferry operator 
Wyker Dampfschiffs-Reederei’s (WDR) 125th 
anniversary festivities, the double-ended, 76m 
Uthlande, currently servicing Germany’s North Frisian 
Islands, has been hailed as shipbuilder J.J Sietas’ first 
serious attempt to diversify into the construction of 
special-purpose vessels. As well as providing a means 
for the islands to boost revenue from tourist traffic, 
the ferry has played a crucial role in linking up the 
communities and local businesses in these locations, 
adding to WDR’s estimated annual ferry traffic of 1.8 
million passengers. 
Uthlande has a capacity for nearly 1200 passengers, 
70 cars and 16 trucks and trailers. Tracks for passenger 
vehicles have been widened to 2.5m, while pedestrians 
can access lounges and deck areas from a dedicated 
point of entry on the side of the ferry. 
Due to the vessel’s draught limitations, J.J Sietas 
plumped for a four-propeller arrangement, whereby 
two VSP drives are positioned at each end of Uthlande’s 
hull. The 16R5 EC/120-1 propellers encompassed by 
the system each have an input power of 540kW, and 
the propulsion arrangements enable transit speeds of 
12knots. As this speed is rarely required during 
scheduled transfer trips, the speed reserves can be used 
instead for consumption and emission-optimised 
driving. Primary power is supplied courtesy of the 
Caterpillar main engines. 
The ‘four-point’  VSP system offers greater 
manoeuvrability, even in tempestuous conditions, and 
the design has incorporated considerations for 
vibration and oscillation control. In addition, J.J Sietas 
has taken account for optimised material thicknesses 
so as to ensure a full-load draught of just 1.75m on a 
deadweight capacity of 385tonnes. 
In all, Uthlande has not just bolstered the growing 
ferry trade among the North Frisian Islands, last 
estimated to be worth some €30 million (US$40.7 
million); it has also given J.J Sietas a new direction, 
and a potential lifeline to combat the effects of the 
global economic downturn. As Rüdiger Fuchs, 
chairman of the management board at the Sietas 
Group in Hamburg, put it as the contract was 
finalised: “Ferries are an excellent fit for our new 
strategy. Our future plans foresee the construction of 
an increasing number of special-built vessels which 
require specialist design and production know-how”.

V
aliant was the first in a series of Z-Tech 4500 tugs 
delivered to the US Navy by J.M Martinac, a 
subcontractor to California-based Pacific Tugboat 
Services. Tailor-made to suit specific US Navy 
requirements, the Z-Tech 4500 specifications build on 
the industry-accepted Z-Tech 6000 hull form, which 
was originally developed by designer Robert Allan for 
tugs operating in the Port of Singapore. 
Alongside her already-delivered sisterships, Reliant 
and Defiant, Valiant is deployed in the US Navy’s 
Naval Region Northwest zone. Each of the Z-Tech 
4500 class tugs features a length of 27.42m, moulded 
breadth of 11.65m, moulded depth of 5m and a 
maximum load draught of 4.88m. 
Her propulsion equipment consists of a pair of CAT 
3512  main engines, each of which is rated 1350kW at 
1600rpm. Each drives a Schottel Model SRP 1012 
steering / propulsion Z-Drive unit, with 2100mm 
diameter fixed pitch propellers. In total, Valiant’s 
propulsion set-up amounts to total bollard pull rates of 
42tonnes ahead and 45tonnes astern. Her free-running 
speed is recorded at 12.4knots. 
Valiant’s electrical power derives from a pair of R.A 
Mitchell Co. diesel gen-sets with a John Deere 
6068SFM75 prime mover. Each of these is rated 
130kWe at 1800rpm. Her deck machinery includes a 
ship-handling hawser winch forward and a JonRie 
Series 210 Assist winch, which is fitted with 180m of 
175mm line. The latter has a brake capacity of 
136tonnes and a line pull/speed rating of 9tonnes at 
53m/min. 
The onboard firefighting system, meanwhile, is a 
PTO hooked up to the starboard engine, and 
engages a Stang fire pump. This arrangement 
removes the requirement for excess onboard piping. 
The Stang monitor is capable of delivering 2000gpm 
at 150psi. 
To ensure noise reduction for the crew is kept to a 
maximum, the accommodation deckhouse is separated 
from the machinery spaces. The tugs are also fitted 
with Shibata non-marking grey extruded rubber, above 
and below the waterline, so as to not leave abrasive 
marks against the hulls of naval surface ships and 
submarines with which they come into contact.

ompleted and delivered by Spain’s Freire Shipyard in 
May 2010, Volstad Surveyor is an 85m x 18m vessel, 
specifically designed to handle ROV and survey support 
services, as well as construction support activities – for 
instance, the pre-lay surveying of designated pipelines – 
and to partake in light construction work. 
At time of going to press, the vessel was about to enter 
into a charter contract with DeepOcean AS, a subsidiary of 
Trico Marine. DeepOcean intends to utilise Volstad 
Surveyor, starting February 2011, in pipeline installation 
projects at the Marulk and SmØrbukk North East field 
developments. 
Volstad Surveyor is equipped with an AHC offshore 
crane, boasting a 70tonne capacity; a ROV hanger; a moon 
pool (allowing onboard personnel to access the water 
below); and a helicopter deck. She has accommodation for 
a total of 72 persons. 
Similar onboard equipment includes three Palfinger 
auxiliary cranes and two Aker Brattvagg winches. 
Two ABB AMA 500L6L BAFMH electric propulsion 
motors generate a combined output of 4400kW for the 
vessel, while a pair of Rolls-Royce AZIPULL-AZP100CP 
propulsion units are capable of producing speeds up to
