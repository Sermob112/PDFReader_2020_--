A
ora, completed in April this year, is a 22m
research vessel designed and built by Macduff
Shipyards, of Grampian, Scotland.
The complete
vessel was built in-house, with steel being prepared
and cut at the builder's profiling division. This is a
move away from Macduff's usual boats, which are
more usually fishing vessels.
This vessel was commissioned by the University of
London for the University Marine Biological
Station, Millport (UMBSM), to operate from the
marine station on the Isle of Cumbrae, Scotland.
Aora replaces a smaller research vessel of the
same name, and will provide improved teaching and
research facilities for marine biology students all
over the UK. The research that is carried out is of
national interest, and includes the ecological impact
of human activity on marine habitats, assessment of
the damage made to the seabed by trawlers, and the
provision of data for the management of fish
stocks.
Main engines consist of two Mitsubishi S6MPTA
models, supplied by Macduff Diesels Ltd. Aora also
has two FP 4-bladed propellers, and two high
performance rudders. The gearboxes were acquired
from Reintjes, and are model WAF 1641. Electrical
work on Aora was sub-contracted to Fraserburgh-
based company, R D Downie.

I
n May 2003, Vigo shipyards Metalships & Docks
SA delivered the biggest offshore support vessel
built in Spain, to Norwegian company North Sea
Commander Shipping A/S. Árbol Grande has a total
length of
95m, a 20m breadth, and power of
11,560hp. The contract for this offshore vessel
amounts to 35 million and it began building in
January 2002.
Árbol Grande (meaning Big Tree) will perform
rescue operations at high-sea oilrigs. Her first
destination was the Gulf of Mexico, where she has a
five-year contract with the Mexican company
Diavaz. Crew will be Spanish and will consist of 20
people.
The most remarkable features about this vessel are
not its dimensions, but the up-to-date technology
used in its building process, as well as the abundance
of electronic devices, which makes it an extremely
safe vessel with optimal manoeuvrability. This is due
to five propellers, three of which are azimuthing.
Árbol Grande also has an automatic dynamic
positioning system, heliport, deck moonpool, and
room for 200 people in total.
All equipments installed in the vessel comply with
the 
most 
demanding 
quality 
standards 
in
shipbuilding. Within its electric diesel propulsion
system, Árbol Grande has four diesel generators
amounting to 8680kW. Propulsion consists of five
propellers, two of which are 2400kW azimuth
propellers; a compass bow azimuth propeller of
1200kW and two other transversal tunnel propellers
located fore, which are of 900kW each. All these
propellers provide the vessel with an optimal
manoeuvrability.
The vessel also has a redundant dynamic
positioning system (DP II) which allows it to
maintain its position automatically with an accuracy
of 1m
2 under adverse meteorological conditions (up
to force 9 winds). Furthermore, Árbol Grande is
completely automatic, which allows the monitoring
and control of
all her services from three 
computers.
In order to correctly conduct its support activities,
the vessel has been provided with complete deck
equipment consisting of
two 25tonne/m and
16tonne/m auxiliary cranes,
moonpool with
hydraulic hatchway and tugger-type reels, amongst
other features. Furthermore the deck is covered with
high thickness wood in order to allow an appropriate
arrangement of the cargo.
The vessel's safety is optimal and the rescue
equipment consists of a rescue boat, four lifeboats,
rescue rafts, according to the applicable regulations,
centralised detection and extinction system,
including its corresponding safety equipment.

T
he Austal-built catamaran Bocayna Express was this
year delivered to European operator Fred Olsen, SA.
This vessel is the first of a new breed of medium-sized
Auto Express catamarans that have been designed with a
specific focus on low acquisition and running costs.
Austal's analysis of its performance and capacity
specifications reveals noticeably higher transport
efficiency than previous fast ferries in this size and speed
range. With 19% greater car capacity Bocayna Express is
less than 9% slower than a similarly sized monohull fast
ferry that has 35% more power.
During construction every effort was made to save
weight and a significant reduction in displacement
resulted in a maximum deadweight in excess of
300tonnes. Consequently, on sea trials the ferry achieved
speeds in excess of 40 knots lightship and just under
36knots loaded. The originally stated contract speed was
31knots. Bocayna Express is powered by two 12-cylinder
and two 18-cylinder MAN B&W VP185 diesels which
drive Kamewa waterjets.
The 450 passenger capacity catamaran operates
between the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura and
replaces a 14knot monohull ro-pax ferry. Its design was
specifically developed taking the route's shallow waters,
strong winds, and physical ship size restrictions into
account, as well as the need to work harmoniously with
the existing terminal infrastructure.
Short turnaround times are facilitated by the
straightforward layout of the drive-through vehicle deck,
which is open at both bow and stern to save weight and
reduce construction cost. Rated for axle loads up to
12tonnes and providing clear height of 4.2m, the deck
can carry trucks and buses in addition to cars and
motorcycles. Maximum capacity is 69 cars and there are
110lane metres for heavy vehicles.
One of the cabin's main features is the lounge area
located between the bar aft and the shop and transverse
walkway amidships. The lounge is fitted out with
comfortable armchairs arranged around circular pedestal
tables and is flooded with natural light from a large
skylight.
Outboard of the lounge area are rows of four aircraft
style seats then another aisle and pairs of seats alongside
the windows. The seats come complete with fold-down
tables and information pockets. The same seating layout
is repeated in the forward saloon that surrounds a central
utilities block and faces an expanse of aft raked windows
running the full width of the cabin, providing passengers
with views over the bows. Aft there is an open sun deck
and outdoor bar.
Bocayna Express will operate with a crew of 16,
including a three-person bridge team. In keeping with
Fred Olsen's wishes, the bridge does not have wing
stations. Instead, the Captain uses the ferry's CCTV
system to monitor position while berthing. Featured
among the array of modern electronics on bridge is
Austal Ships' Marine Link ship control and monitoring
system. This allows extensive monitoring of machinery
and systems as well as providing a powerful on-line
system to manage all user manuals as well as other ship's
drawings and documentation.

aballo Andaluz is an offshore support, airdiving and
light maintenance vessel which works in the
Mexican part of the Gulf of Mexico. Home port is Cd
del Carmen and the operational area is the Cantarell
field, off the coast of the Yucatan penisula. Caballo
Andaluz differs from her sister, Caballo de Troya, in that
she is longer, with three web frames (of 5.4 m), and she
has a diving moon pool.
The engine room is located forward with the three
diesel generators. Aft of the engine room there are two
fuel export pumps, each with a capacity of 40m³/hr at
1.8bar. Total fuel capacity onboard is 517m³ and part of
this can be exported to third party.
A moon pool has been fitted on the centre line of the
ship. It can be opened by removing the upper and lower
plating. Aft of the moon pool there is a large empty
space, the hold. The hold is accessible through a deck
hatch and can be used for storage of
various
equipment.
The complete interior of the hull is
protected by a double skin and a double bottom.
In the main diesel generator room there are three
diesel generators installed. Forward of the diesel
generator room is the switchboard room and the electro
motors for the tunnel thrusters. Main power generation
is via three 968kW Caterpillar engines, and the main
distribution power totals 480V/60Hz.
The centre diesel generator can be connected to
either starboard side or port side of the main
distribution board. The three diesel generators can all
run parallel and in the normal operational condition
two engines are required. In the case of severe 
problems 
onboard,
one 
azimuthing 
thruster 
can be powered, together with the rest of the
auxiliaries, by one diesel generator.
The azimuthing thrusters are speed controlled via
frequency drives of the 12 pulse type or pseudo 24
pulse. In this way the harmonic distortions are reduced
to acceptable values in all operational conditions, less
than 4%. The tunnel thrusters forward are of constant
speed type with CP.
Thruster motors forward and aft, as well as frequency
drives, are all water cooled, in order to ensure safe
operation also in the tropics. The thruster room aft has
an insulated deckhead (sun-radiation) and a special air
cooler in order to keep the environmental temperature
in the thrusters' room within acceptable limits.
Caballo Andaluz has a duplex Dynamic Positioning
system (DP) with two independent Differential Global
Positioning Systems and a laser scan system.
This
power management system is required to always be 
on-line.
The duplex DP system located on the bridge has been
split up with one computer and operator panel facing
forward and one computer and operating panel facing
aft. Normal transit is performed from the forward
bridge where all the necessary controls and
instrumentations are located for this. DP operations are
be conducted from the aft bridge and a special
manoeuvring console was fitted for this purpose.
Crew accommodation consists of 45 beds in one,
two, and four person cabins. Each cabin has its own
shower and w/c unit.

amen Shipyards, Gorinchem, this year completed the
complex and sophisticated research vessel Celtic
Explorer for the Irish Marine Institute, Dublin. This 65m
ship was constructed by Damen in partnership with the
Vlissingen yard of Royal Schelde and follows two other
important vessels previously delivered to Ireland, the
research vessel Celtic Voyager and the buoy maintenance ship
Granuaille. The work to be carried out by this new vessel will
include a National Seabed Survey in Irish waters,
performing a vital role in monitoring and recording fish
stocks, oceanographic tasks, and a wide range of other
maritime duties. The new vessel is only the third of its kind
in Europe and represents a significant milestone in Irish
marine research.
Celtic Explorer was ordered to a demanding specification
requiring compliance with the most stringent requirements
for a vessel capable of carrying out sophisticated fishery,
geological, and hydrographical research and environmental
sampling. The ship had to comply with Lloyd's Register of
Shipping class +100A1, Ice class 1D, IMC, UMS, SCM for
a multi-purpose research vessel. It was also to comply with
the International Convention on Exploration of the Seas
(ICES) '209' report on 'Silent Fish Surveying'. Celtic Explorer
is claimed to be the first vessel in the world to comply with
ICES 209 without any compromise in the required sound
frequency range between 10Hz and 63kHz.
To meet these requirements special attention had to be
given in design, construction, and fitting out to minimise
radiated underwater noise, onboard acoustic interference,
and vibration. As a multi-purpose vessel it was necessary to
ensure that equipment and resources could be changed
easily from, for example, fisheries work to hydrographical
survey.
The transversely framed, welded steel hull of Celtic
Explorer is 65.5m in length overall with a moulded breadth
of 15.0m, depth of 8.4m, and design draught of 5.6m. Ice
class requirements are met by reinforcing the foreship with
intermediate framing and heavier shell plating. The
underwater profile incorporates a bulbous bow, a smooth
after body with a single propeller, and provision for bow
and stern thrusters. Internal tanks are provided for 400m
3 of
fuel oil and 100m
3 of fresh water, ballast tanks fore and aft,
and a semi-passive roll reduction tank. A double bottom is
incorporated between the fore and after peak bulkheads.
In order to assist the deployment of scientific transducers,
a retractable fin keel is provided just forward of amidships.
The keel is located in a totally enclosed vertical steel trunk
and can be raised or lowered by means of an electrically
powered winch controlled from the bridge.
At the heart of Celtic Explorer is a sophisticated 'low noise'
diesel-electric propulsion system that has been specially
developed for the vessel with the assistance of Dutch
specialist Bakker Sliedrecht Elektro Industrie. A single,
specially designed, 'extremely low noise' FP propeller of
3200mm diameter is directly driven (without gearbox) by
two direct current (DC) Indar, low speed, electric motors
coupled in tandem. Each of the low noise DC motors has
a maximum power rating of 1500kW at 180rev/min which
are fed and controlled by two Bakker custom build digital
drives in a semi 24-pulse configuration together with two
double winding transformers with an extra low-noise mode.
The vessel can achieve a maximum speed of approximately
15.5knots at 100% MCR.
A single 'high-lift' ice class rudder is controlled by an
electro-hydraulic steering system powered by two hydraulic
pumps. Two thrusters are also an important part of the
propulsion system. An Elliot Gill jet powered by a 720kW
electric motor is installed in the bow and delivers a
maximum omni-directional thrust of
6.2tonnes. A
transverse tunnel thruster in the stern, located beneath the
main propeller shaft, has a CP propeller and is powered by
a 400kW motor.
Power generation for the propulsion system and ship's
main electrical supply is provided by three Wärtsilä diesel
engines coupled to Indar generators. Two Wärtsilä 9L20
powered generators produce 1620 kW each and a Wärtsilä
6L20 drives a 1080 kW generator, all at 690V. Two
transformers are used to provide 400V and 230V supplies.
Celtic Explorer is fitted with a comprehensive array of
winches and deck equipment enabling the vessel to handle
a wide range of fisheries research equipment and nets,
towed hydrographic sensors, and also to carry out other
marine tasks over the stern. A total of eleven winches are
installed on the vessel. Fishing operations are controlled by
a sophisticated trawl winch and handling system, with 'auto-
trawl' displays and controls on the bridge. Two 30tonnes
split trawl winches located on the main work deck are each
fitted with 3500m of wire and have a maximum line pull of
30tonnes at 78m/min. A pair of 12 tonnes Gilson winches
are located at bridge deck level. Three net drum winches are
provided, two rated at 35 tonnes line pull and one at
45tonnes is fitted for towing purposes and incorporates a
constant tensioning system. The trawl gantry operates in
conjunction with a 5.6tonnes net-sounding winch
accommodating 3200m of 11mm diameter wire.
Three hydraulically operated deck cranes are provided,
one with a lifting capacity of 120tonnes/m and two of
15tonnes/m, one of the latter is mounted on the foredeck.
The cranes can also be radio controlled if required.
The two stern mounted 'A' frames have lifting
capacities of 25tonnes and 10tonnes, both at a
working radius of 3m. A lifting frame with a 'T'
configuration can lift 10tonnes and is located on the
starboard side of the main work deck.
The vessel's anchoring equipment comprises two 'high
holding power' anchors handled by an electro-hydraulic
windlass located under cover, within the forecastle.
Warping heads are incorporated for mooring and the
windlass drive is fitted with a tension control device.
A single, vertical capstan with a 5tonnes pull is 
provided aft.
Fully air conditioned accommodation is provided for
31 persons, 12 crew and 19 scientists. The facilities for
scientific staff onboard include four well-equipped
laboratories for chemistry, wet fish research, water
sampling and dry procedures. A purpose designed IT
room is included and a dedicated scientist's office and
meeting room. Provision is made to accommodate
additional scientific equipment contained in laboratory
containers on deck.

C
-Leader (Hull 218), an offshore support vessel,
was completed at North American Fabricators
(NAF) and was delivered to Shell in early February
2003. This vessel is the first in a series of five sisters
to be built at NAF.
The second vessel in the series,
C-Legend
(Hull 219), was delivered for charter at the end 
of June, also to Shell. The next three vessels in the 
series are: C-Legacy (which was delivered September
2003), C-Liberty (which was delivered in October
2003), and the as yet unnamed Hull 280 (which will
be delivered in March 2004).
Edison Chouest Offshore is fairly unique in the
offshore marine industry, in that it can design and
build vessels, then often owns and operates the
vessels, as well as chartering and selling vessels on to
other companies. Edison Chouest Offshore claim
that this series is one of the most technically
advanced vessels in the world.
C-Leader is classed by the American Bureau of
Shipping, and has certificates from the United States
Coast Guard, SOLAS, as well as MARPOL. She is
85m long, has a breadth of 18.28m, a depth of
7.31m, and a deadweight of 4811tonnes.
She is powered by two Caterpillar 3608 diesel
engines, and contains both a bow thruster, and a
tunnel thruster, giving her a total propulsion power
of 8400hp.
There are two standard generators
onboard, and one emergency set.
Special features of these vessels include two
passive type anti-roll tanks, and bilge keels for ship
motion stability. For precise positioning C-Leader
has been equipped with DPS-2. The vessel also has
two 4tonne tuggers, and one 1406kg capacity deck
crane.
Lifesaving equipment is comprehensive,
as
expected in the offshore industry, and includes two
25-man and two 20-man liferafts, one Sea Force 490
SOLAS O/B rescue boat, and all the other
equipment necessary for USCG and SOLAS
classification.

T
his catamaran ferry was designed by Nigel Gee &
Associates for Derecktor's bid on the Alaska
Marine Highway System Project. It is designed to be a
safe, high-speed ro-ro passenger ferry that minimises
costs and can interface with existing AMHS docks and
pier side facilities.
Fairweather can carry 250 passengers on the main deck
and 30 large vehicles - of the type mostly used in Alaska
- on the cargo deck at a continuous-rating service speed
of 35knots and with great comfort up to sea state 6.
Powered by four diesel engines and four water jets, this
73m catamaran uses a geosym of the Nigel Gee hull
form employed in the 41m Flying Cloud, which has been
shown to provide the highest transport efficiency of any
high-speed ferry of this size. A complete set of tank
tests has been carried out, showing very low wake wash
characteristics.
Classed with DNV Maltese Cross 1A1 HSLC, R3 and
with full USCG compliance to SOLAS/HSC Code Cat
B, this aluminium vessel is the first vehicle and passenger
high-speed ferry ever built in the US and it takes
advantage of Derecktor's experience and high level of
craftsmanship in the field of highly-stressed aluminium
structure construction.
The main deck has interior seating for 150 passengers
in the observation lounge forward, and 104 in the snack
bar area midship with a mixture of airline type reclining
seats and table arrangements. Further seating is provided
in the exterior solarium located aft. Full ADA
compliance is guaranteed throughout the vessel.
Dedicated areas for video games and work/study and a
full service snack bar complete the onboard
accommodations.

A
s a result of a tender exercise in early 2002
Stocznia Pólnocna SA - Northern Shipyard,
located in Gdansk, Poland, was awarded an order for
construction and delivery of a general purpose ferry
for the Shetland Islands Council. The vessel was the
second to be built at Northern Shipyard for this
owner - previously delivered was a ro-ro
vehicle/passenger ferry Linga in 2002 (Significant
Small Ships of 2002).
These vessels were built as
parts of
a fleet renewal programme aimed at
replacing the ageing inter island ferry fleet in the
Shetland Islands. Linga was the first vessel of this
programme.
MacDuff Ship Design, Scotland, developed the
tender technical specification for the Shetland Islands
Council.
The 
detail 
design,
technical 
and
classification project for this latest vessel was
prepared by Northern Shipyard subsidiary design
office - Naval Engineering & Design. Filla meets 
the requirements set by Lloyd's Register, the 
British Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) 
and EU Directive 98/18/EC regarding passenger
vessels.
Filla was launched in December 2002, and the
completed ferry was delivered to her owner in May
2003 and placed into service in June 2003. The vessel
has a length overall 35.5m and a beam of 9m, and is
a ro-ro multipurpose ferry designed to carry up to 30
passengers, nine cars or one lorry on deck and cargo
in refrigerated holds (self load and discharge via a
13tonne hydraulic crane).
Filla has been designed to operate on the longest of
the Shetland Island Council's inter island ferry routes
- between Lerwick, the capital of the archipelago, and
the remote group of islands called Out Skerries - this
being a four and a half hour round trip. The vessel's
propulsion is via two Mitsubishi Diesel engines,
671kW each, driving two four-blade CP propellers.
The vessel is fitted with two HRP hydraulic bow
thrusters driven from the main engine gearboxes. The
ship is equipped with three Mitsubishi generating sets
- two main sets and an emergency set.
Rotary vane steering gear was supplied by Rolls-
Royce Marine Tenfjord, to twin high efficiency
rudders.
Fire protection consists of
a fire 
detection system, supported by a water drenching
system to extinguish fire in the car deck and a high-
pressure water vapour system used in the other
internal spaces.
Life saving equipment consists of two MES
stations (provided by Liferaft Systems Australia) and
a FRB delivered by Norwegian Maritime Equipment.
Navigation equipment was provided by Furuno,
similar to that on Linga, and is fitted with a voyage
data recorder supplied by Broadgate. Filla is fitted
with integrated automation system UMAS, delivered
by Rolls-Royce Marine.

T
hree new 28m high speed aluminium passenger
catamarans, named First Ferry IX, First Ferry X
and First Ferry XI have been successfully delivered to
owners, New World First Ferry Services Ltd, of
Hong Kong.
These vessels were constructed 
by Wang Tak Engineering & Shipbuilding Co Ltd,
one of Hong Kong's oldest established ship building
and repair yard with more than 60 years history.
The design is from Australia's Commercial Marine
Consulting Services (CMCS). This hull form was
selected from the proven range of
deep vee
catamaran hulls suitable for coastal ferry operation,
which has been modified and refined in conjunction
with Wang Tak's technical staff and the owner's
experience in ferry operation in Hong Kong waters.
Assisting in the development of the hull form,
extensive model tank testing was carried out at the
Australian Maritime College (AMC) in Tasmania.
This hull form is the symmetrical deep vee type,
which cuts through the water in smooth motion. This
matched with the advantages of the CMCS aerofoil
mini-keels which give great tracking and added
protection to the 1016mm, five-bladed Teignbridge
propellers. Passengers are thus ensured a very
comfortable ride.
These vessel runs with very low wash, a reason why
the particular hull form was selected for this
application. Hull scantling designs were also selected
for robust service. This matched with the latest
techniques in fabrication, and has resulted in a very
smooth finish to the hull and deckhouse.
The deckhouse layout has been designed to suit
owner's operational requirements. The aluminium
catamarans comfortably seat 231 passengers and 
are 
powered 
by 
twin 
MTU 
12V2000M70 
(at 778kW) diesel engines giving the vessel a top
speed of 27knots and a fully loaded cruise speed of
25knots.
The high standard of fit-out has been achieved by
attention to detail and the use of light weight
honeycomb panels. Passenger seating is arranged as 3
x 5 x 3 on the main deck and 3 x 4 x 3 on the upper
deck, using Beurteaux Ocean Tourist HB seats
finished in the client's corporate colours. Side
windows are large and designed for panoramic
exterior vision. All interior spaces are air conditioned
with a seawater cooled system. The raised helm
position at wheelhouse affords the master with good
all-round vision. Helm console is spacious and well
laid out.

W
ith the delivery of
two 41.4m highly
customised catamarans to Hong Kong's New
World First Travel Services Ltd, Image Marine has
set a new benchmark in purpose designed and built
harbour cruise vessels. With the flexibility for
sightseeing and charter/function work, this order
followed the delivery of
three high-speed
catamarans to the same group by Image Marine's
parent company, Austal Ships.
First Travel XXXI and First Travel XXXI will
cruise the warmer climes of busy Hong Kong
Harbour at around 16knots.
The vessels combine
the New World group's striking orange, purple,
and green livery with an even more eye-catching
Chinese golden dragon on the top deck. Over 16m
long, the dragons are particularly spectacular when
spraying water from their mouths and when
highlighted in colourful light shows during evening
cruises.
In addition to the open top deck which provides
panoramic views, passengers can choose between
upper and lower enclosed decks which feature extra
large side windows and broad expanses of glass on
the forward bulkheads to maximise viewing
opportunities. Dimmable interior lighting enhances
the evening and night cruise experiences and a
multi-lingual onboard tourist information system
provides insights into the city's attractions.
The layout of the vessels features lounge and table
arrangements throughout, with seats for 172
passengers on the main deck and 182 passengers on
the upper deck.
Each vessel can also carry
passengers in wheelchairs. Other onboard facilities
include a kiosk on main deck serving a variety of
drinks and light meals, an upper deck bar and
cultural booths providing explanations of Hong
Kong's unique east-meets-west culture. Adding to
the cruise experience, a variety of performances will
be staged onboard, ranging from magic and live
music to traditional Chinese acts including
acrobatics.
To facilitate this, the vessels are equipped with
professional level audio-visual systems and part of
the main deck forward converts to a dance floor,
complete with lighting. This is achieved by removing
the central section of seating, a process that takes
only a short time. The incorporation of
these
features, plus catering facilities on the main deck
and in the port hull, contributes to the catamarans'
versatility and makes them an attractive charter
option for functions, seminars and entertainment
performances.

S
ince 2001 Dockstavarvet has been engaged in the
development of a patrol vessel which is safe for
its personnel as well as safe operating under critical
conditions. These boats have been built because of
the requirements for personnel safety and safe
operations of patrol craft when participating in
international peace-keeping and rescue operations.
Safety measures usually mean increased weight,
and as a result,
lower speed.
However,
Dockstavarvet has combined modifications of a
boat by upgrading the existing Scania DSI 14
engines. The result was increased power, some extra
50hp per engine, giving some 675hp/engine and a
loaded speed of
close to 40knots could be
maintained.
This patrol craft, designated CB 90 HS, has been
developed to fulfil Armour Protection Level 4 (Nato
Ball 7.6 mm). It will also have NBC protection. The
safety features include 38mm security glass in all
windows, a 20mm laminate build up of multiple
layers 
of
polyethylene 
fibre 
covering 
the
engineroom, transport room, and wheelhouse.
The transom is covered with a 5mm steel, type
Armox 600.
The weight has been increased by
3.8tonnes, giving a full load displacement of
22.6tonnes. The boat can carry up to 18 men, fully
equipped, or a corresponding amount of cargo.
An air condition system is also included for
operations in tropical conditions. NBC protection is
built up by a closed ventilation system under
pressure, making it possible for the boat to get out
of areas of contamination.
The CB 90 HS is
furthermore equipped with specially adapted
radar/chart monitors and control panels to operate
in full darkness at 40knots when the crew use IR
night goggles.
The CB 90 HS originates from a conventional CB
90, the Combat Boat 90 H, which has been under
serial production for the Swedish Navy for 
more than 10 years. The concept with armour
protection has nowadays more or less become a
necessity and is asked for by more and more
customers worldwide.

G
rampian Surveyor was built by Balenciaga Shipyards
for North Star Shipping of Aberdeen, UK. The
vessel is intended for performing ROV support in
carrying out subsea survey and pipeline construction and
maintenance tasks, as well as for supply duties carrying
fresh water, fuel oil and pipes, containers, etc, to offshore
installations. In common with many other recent
examples of this type of ship, it features a diesel electric
power plant for reasons of economy and lower noise
levels.
IMT, in cooperation with the ship owners, carried out
the main part of the design, especially concentrating on
sturdiness and aesthetic lines. The ship was designed
from the outset to perform the roles of both a survey
vessel and a supply ship. The survey role demands
accommodation for a large crew capacity with dedicated
ROV operating rooms, an ROV platform, ROV
workshop, and offshore rated crane.
The diesel electric generating plant is centred around
four Siemens generating sets powered by MaK 6M25
engines. Each generator is capable of producing 1800kW
at 690V. The power is delivered via a dedicated
propulsion switchboard to five Rolls-Royce thrusters
driven by Siemens electric motors: two azimuthing
Aquamaster Contaz 15 thrusters aft, each rated 2200kW;
one Aquamaster UL1201 retractable bow thruster of
883kW and two 767kW Kamewa TT1650-FP-KIII
tunnel thrusters. On the main deck there is a  Caterpillar
3306TA 170kW emergency/harbour generating set. This
large margin of propulsion power has been employed to
give the ship good station-keeping capabilities under DP
control in bad weather.
The main propulsion units are water-cooled and
feature twin counter-rotating propellers, aft of the
azimuthing pod. These, with the three electrically driven
bow thrusters, are centrally controlled by a Nautronix
ASK5002 DP2 system. All propulsion units can also be
operated by means of individual controls from the fore
and aft stations in the wheelhouse, and from a portable
joystick system, through the DP system. The DP
equipment includes four position reference systems,
DGPS, Fanbeam laser and hydroacoustic, all supplied by
Nautronix, and a Kongsberg Simrad Hipap 500.
Below decks the vessel is divided into the bow thruster
compartment, where all three forward thrusters are sited,
the engine room, the cargo tanks aft of amidships, with
two tunnels separating the centre tanks for fuel from the
side tanks outboard, and the cargo pump room aft.
These tunnels also serve for routing of piping and the
heavy gauge wiring required for the propulsion motors.
Aft, in the propulsion compartment, all main
propulsion equipment is fitted comprising transformers,
water-cooled frequency converters and electric motors
for the Contaz 15 propulsion units. The machinery
rooms are air conditioned for operation in tropical
regions.
The automation system controlling alarms, power
management and load sharing of generators, remote tank
level reading, draught measurement, cargo pump
operation, remote valve control and stability programme
was supplied by Steinco, in close cooperation with
Siemens.
Accommodation is provided for 49 crew members, in
single and two man cabins, all with individual sanitary
facilities, distributed over four decks above the main
deck. A sauna and a fitness room is provided, along with
a two-bed hospital cabin. Two client offices are provided
on the forecastle deck. Accommodation for captain and
chief engineer, as well as eight other officer and guest
cabins, and a ship's office is located on one level. The
upper deck has two ROV control rooms, the on-line
room being sited on the starboard side to provide good
visibility over the ROV platform deck.
The wheelhouse is designed for space and good all-
round visibility. Aft there is a walk around console with
all the ship's controls, as well as a radar repeater, internal
communications and VHF radio equipment. The DP
dual console is sited aft overlooking the aft deck. In the
centre of the wheelhouse, adjacent to the exhaust casing
there is a sunken satellite communications centre, which
also serves as the wheelhouse office. To port there is a
small meeting area. The forward console, for conning the
vessel while in transit, incorporates all ship controls, two
radars, the navigation equipment and main GMDSS A3
radio communication console.

S
afehaven Marine has this year launched its new
catamaran design, the Wildcat. This is a 10.75m
offshore power cat designed for a multitude of work
boat applications. The first vessel, High Velocity, is a sea
angling charter version which capitalises on the cat's
wide beam with an 'island wheelhouse design', allowing
access to the full length of the boat for angling, yet still
maintains a large cabin for accommodation and shelter.
One of the main design briefs for the Wildcat was to
make the vessel as attractive and sleek as possible. The
vessel has been designed to combine safe dependable
sea keeping and stability with performance and
economy. The Wildcat hull design utilises symmetrical
planning hulls.
The hulls are multi-chine in form. The main chine
deflects water out and away form the hulls having a
two-fold effect. On the outboard chine this improves
ride dryness and reduces wetted area. On the inboard
chine the spray is turned so that in waves it provides a
cushion effect. The spray is mixed with air coming
down the tunnel and creates a high-density medium,
which when compressed dampens motions through
waves. Slamming on the bridge deck is eliminated as a
result of the hull riding on this high-density spray
cushion. A second chine situated 200mm higher than
the main chine further aids in boat dryness, especially at
lower speeds when the main chine is mainly immersed.
Full-length keels are incorporated, and provide
protection to the propellers, as well as increasing the
hulls grip on the water for slow drift speeds.
The vessels beam has been constrained to a wide
4.59m, providing a good compromise between work
area, stability, and minimal slamming that tends occurs
on catamarans that have a very wide bridge deck. Also
marina space and berthing facilities are considered,
where excessive beam can be hard to facilitate.
Due to the slender nature of catamaran hulls, in
choppy conditions vertical accelerations are much
reduced in comparison with monohulls, giving a gentle
ride and motion. However, the biggest disadvantage of
the older type of catamaran hull - which featured very
fine sections forward with little reserve buoyancy - gave
a very smooth ride in short sea states, but suffering
badly in ocean swell conditions due to slamming on the
bridge deck. This shortcoming has been solved with
much fuller forward sections, offering greater buoyancy
and giving the hull the necessary lift to prevent
slamming on the bridge deck allowing higher speeds to
be maintained into larger ocean swells.
At sea, this catamaran has a distinct advantage, the
twin hulls form a 'grove' in the water allowing the hull
to track as if on rails whilst the tremendous transverse
stability means the hull suffers little yaw and surge,
especially in quartering seas allowing virtually 'hands off
steering'.
Assessing the vessels handling during 
trials, she was run on all angles with the waves, and
virtually no roll or yaw was encountered and no helm
correction was needed. Heading into sea, she again
gave a very smooth ride with zero slamming on the
bridge deck.
When slowed down to displacement speeds in the
large and steep breakers in the tidal race she behaved
very well with no pitching, with the hulls providing
plenty of buoyancy. On further trials in less severe
conditions (in force 5 conditions with 2.13m seas), she
was able to maintain a service speed of 17knots at
2000rev/min and was able to punch into the waves
comfortably.
The chines do a very good job of suppressing spray,
and the spray pattern is clean and low, indeed in
moderate conditions very little spray comes aboard.
Also of interest is her low wash characteristics, which
result in a wash height approximately 50% less than a
comparable monohull.
At a light ship displacement of 8550kg, and powered
by twin 300hp Caterpillar 3126 engines, she achieved
27knots with a comfortable cruise of 22knots at
2400rev/min. Throttling back even further to a very
economical 2000rev/min, still provided l7knots. In
comparison with a similarly powered full keel
monohull, at a similar displacement, the catamaran
shows a distinct performance advantage.
Working area is one of the catamarans main
advantages. High Velocity has a large flush aft cockpit.
The walkway up each side of the cabin is wide enough
for two persons to pass each other, and at the fore deck,
mooring and anchoring is easily and safely carried out.
The anchor locker is very large and incorporated in to
the superstructure, forming a comfortable seat.
Accommodation on this vessel is very luxurious,
being lined and carpeted, and constructed in a
combination of teak and GRP mouldings. The helm
console is central in the cabin and offers excellent
visibility. Either side is standing room with doors
leading down to the fore cabins in each hull, which
feature a reasonably sized V berth. There is a large
galley too, with sink, strainer, and gas hop. Opposite to
port is a very comfortable curved settee with a folding
table. The heads compartment is accessed from the aft
cockpit and usefully, can be hosed down. The two
engines are situated below large flush hatches which
feature very wide and deep 127mm x 152mm drainage
channels and several outlets, which should ensure no
water finds its way below decks.

ew survey vessels entered service for the Royal Navy
during 2003 HMS Enterprise (and sister HMS Echo,
delivered at the end of 2002) were constructed at
Appledore Shipbuilders to a preliminary design provided
by VT Shipbuilding Ltd.
These new ships replace the H-Class ships and have a
much-increased capability. They have a displacement of
3500tonnes, are 90m in length and have a maximum
speed of 15knots. They are designed and constructed to
Lloyd's Register rules, including Ice Class 1C and EP, plus
MCA overlaid by Naval Standards. Echo is the first RN
vessel with both full electric AC propulsion system and
podded drives.
The primary roles of the ships are hydrographic and
oceanographic survey. They are designed to capture data
from the seabed and the water column and process the
data onboard, which is then stored for downloading to the
hydrographic office. They can gather hydrographic sonar
data in shallow to medium depths, and oceanographic
data and bottom sampling data down to 6000m.
Secondary roles of the ships include rapid environmental
assessment, support of amphibious operations, and
support to mine countermeasure operations.
Survey sensors comprise a combination of hull
mounted and towed or over side sensors.
Kongsberg
Simrad multibeam echo sounder provides a capability
enabling hydrographic data to be gathered at a rate up to
120 times that of a single beam sounder. Two KS EA500
echo sounders are also fitted, and all the transducers are
fitted in a gondola mounted below the keel. This feature,
which reduces entrained air affecting transducer
performance, and the size of the ships enables gathering
data in conditions up to sea state 6.
Towed sensors measure conductivity, temperature,
scatterance and suspended microscopic material in the
water column down to 500m. Magnetometers, Sub
bottom profilers and the Geo-Acoustics Sonar 2094 side-
scan sonar are also carried and deployed from the A-
frame on the stern. Behind shell doors in the starboard
side of the ship lies the 'Baltic Room'. From here the
CTD oceanographic sampling gear and the Shipek grab
seabed sampler can be deployed from a hydraulically
operated boom down to depths of 6000m. The survey
data is processed and stored via a Kongsberg Simrad
Integrated Survey System, and survey operations are
supported by a comprehensive Navigation by Kelvin
Hughes, plus a Ship Positioning control system providing
joystick control.
The ship's propulsion and electrical power system
comprises three 1.6MW Ruston and one 550kW
Cummins powered 690V diesel generator, providing
electrical power to the two ABB 1.7MW Compact
Azipods, Brunvoll bowthruster and Ships services (via
transformers). The VTC (now Rolls-Royce) EPCAMS
system provides automatic electrical power control and
management.
The ships have damage control
arrangements to full Royal Naval standards as well as a
gas-tight citadel to protect against nuclear, biological and
chemical agents.

L
amma and Tap Mun are the latest HUD Marine
(Hongkong Salvage and Towage) newbuildings,
and the first pure harbour tugs it has built since 1995.
Their design is based on the Lam Tong class with
minor improvements to include an enhanced
wheelhouse incorporating an internal staircase. The
other improvements are noise suppression in the
accommodation, sewage treatment plant and NOx
certified engines.
The priority was reliability of
equipment to enable HKST to service the high
business volume on Hong Kong Harbour.
Each tug is powered by two Niigata type 6L2SHX
engines developing 3200bhp in total. This produces
the high bollard pull required for harbour towage,
while still having excellent fuel economy.
The
importance of length, breath, and power ratio for
economical port operation has led HKST to the
present design.
All HKST tugs including Lamma and Tap Mun are
designed to overcome a 'blackout' situation in the
unlikely event one should occur. All controls and
emergency systems are designed to operate under
battery power for at least two hours, which provides
more than sufficient time to remedy an emergency
situation.
In Hong Kong, all tugs operate the push-pull system
and the forward towing winch is a Kitagawa Kogyo
electro-hydraulic driven winch with an 80tonne brake
capacity.
The winch is fitted with 110m x 96mm
Supermix rope which HKST have found to be reliable
and long lasting, averaging well over 2500 tug moves
before being replaced.
These tugs do not have
external firefighting installed since HKST have
sufficient firefighting tugs already.
All HKST harbour tugs operate with three men,
supported by a small but dedicated maintenance team.
The accommodation has a total of six berths for use
by delivery crews. Both earlier sisters, Lam Tong and
Tung Lung, were delivered from Hong Kong to
Melbourne via Cebu and Thursday Island (a 5338miles
voyage in 27 days) with no problems.
Initially these two tugs were the last of
six
newbuildings but due to HKST's continued expansion
into new overseas markets an additional order has
been placed with Kegoga Dock Co for two sister tugs
which are due for delivery in early 2004. The Lamma
class tugs will be for harbour towage in Hong Kong.

R
amon Llull (yard number 311), is an 84m all-
aluminium fast ferry that was built for Balearia
Eurolinies Maritimes, at Rodriquez Cantieri Navali's yard
in Pietra Ligure, Italy. Ramon Lull is part of Rodriquez's
TMV series of Aquastrada monohulls and was followed
by her sistership The Princess which was delivered in July
2003.
Ramon Llull, named after the 13th century Spanish
philosopher, has a capacity for 462 passengers divided
into 106 seats for first class passengers, located on the
upper deck; and 356 seats for economy class, located on
the main deck.
Ramon Llull is fitted with Rodriquez's patented hoistable
upper car deck. This allows the ship to be optimised for
her particular vehicular cargo. For instance, during the
summer months the traffic is primarily passenger cars,
and as such, full use of the car decks is made. During the
winter months, there may be a high number of trucks and
then the upper decks can be hoisted out of position to
allow the taller trucks onboard. Typically, the summer
season will see Ramon Llull optimised for cars, but during
the less tourist dominated winter season the need to carry
trucks is important.
Alternatively, it is possible to mix and match the
position of
the ramps and decks to allow any
combination of trucks/busses and cars onboard. The car
deck has an innovative arrangement often found on larger
Rodriquez TMV 115 vessels, in that the central ramps can
be raised to accommodate tall vehicles such as buses or
trucks. With the decks lowered, the maximum car capacity
is 58 cars but with the decks raised, there are 110lane
metres available for these tall vehicles yet still additional
space for 22 cars. This flexibility is important to allow
Balearia the ability to offer year-round operation for all
vehicle types.
Power is provided by four Man B&W 18VP185 diesel
engines each connected to a dedicated Lips steerable and
reversible waterjet via a Reintjes VLJ 2230 gearbox. This
arrangement will provide a service speed of 39knots
based on 90% MCR and with a full load of passengers
and cars. Maximum speed is approximately 40knots.
She is equipped with the latest in advanced ride control
systems that includes: anti-pitch T-Foils (fore and aft);
anti-roll fins (two per side, fore and aft); transom mounted
intruders for longitudinal trim control as well as anti-roll
control. All systems are fully integrated into a central
command station and have been designed, engineered,
tested, and manufactured by Rodriquez Marine Systems.
This system has been hydronamically designed and
tested to have zero negative effect on the ships speed
which is achieved by dialling in a very small amount of
'lift' into the horizontal planes of
the T-foils.
Furthermore, small rudders are incorporated into the
vertical skegs of the T-Foils which allows the ship to make
course corrections at medium to high speeds whilst
maintaining the waterjets at a zero angle and therefore at
their full thrust position.

orth West Bay Ships this year delivered a 39m
passenger ferry, Red Jet 4, to the Red Funnel
Group, UK, for operation on the Southampton to
Cowes route. The vessel, designed and built in
Australia, was delivered by heavy lift ship to
Southampton in May and entered into service in June.
Features of the design include a low-wash hull
form,
a resiliently mounted superstructure to
minimise noise and vibration transmission for
passenger comfort, and a cabin arrangement and
access doors specifically designed to facilitate rapid
passenger transfer.
The vessel is propelled by two MJP 650 waterjets,
which are driven by two MTU 12V4000 1740bkW
engines, and at full load achieves a service speed of
35knots at 80% MCR. The low-wash hull form has
been developed from Ten, a 33m catamaran built by
North West Bay Ships in 2001, and also incorporates
MDI adjustable interceptors mounted on the transom
of each hull to enable running-trim control under
varying loading conditions.
The ferry operates on a half-hour schedule between
Southampton and Cowes and allows just seven
minutes to turnaround 275 passengers. To facilitate
rapid passenger transfer the passengers are
accommodated on a single deck that has large access
doors amidships and generous aisles. It is possible to
load 200 passengers in only 1.75 minutes. Large
luggage racks and a refreshment preparation area are
provided for passenger convenience.
The interior has been detailed to complement Red
Funnel's other vessels, even down to the fabrics on
the Beurteaux Ocean Tourist high-back seats.
For passenger comfort,
the superstructure is 
isolated from the hull by rubber mounts to 
minimise noise and vibration. The noise levels
measured in the passenger cabin, at full power,
were a comfortable 70dB and 62dB in the
wheelhouse.
The wheelhouse provides good visibility both
forward and aft, and the latest in navigational,
communication and joystick control devices have
been installed. Red Jet 4 is the first vessel to be
equipped with an MJP vector control system. This
system gives the commander exceptional control
when manoeuvring both at high and low speeds. To
assist with berthing the wheelhouse is arranged with
the commander's seat offset to port as all boarding
occurs via an onboard access ramp located on the
port side.
Three Liferaft Systems Australia 128-man liferafts
and a single 65-man raft are located on the upper
deck. Emergency egress from the cabin is through
dual doors, port and starboard, and then via inflatable
mini slides down to the rafts. Additional doors and
emergency windows are located at the forward quarter
points and single doors at the rear of both the
passenger and wheelhouse. In a 50% evacuation test,
146 persons were safely evacuated in nine minutes six
and seconds.

A
mong the world's first vessels produced to the
IMO's HSC 2000 Code requirements, and
designed and built especifically for harsh Norwegian
weather conditions, Image Marine's first vessels for
the northern European market are regarded by the
Australian shipbuilder as among the best it has
produced. They also represent somewhat of a coup,
as Norway is traditionally a supplier, rather than
importer of fast ferries.
Built for leading ferry operator Ofotens og
Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab asa (OVDS) and
named Salten and Steigtind, the passenger-cargo
catamarans operate out of the far northern port of
Bodø. Capable of 33knots, and with capacity for 214
passengers and 30 Euro pallets (12tonnes) of
refrigerated cargo, the 41.3m vessels provide not only
a passenger service, but also the only transportation
link for travel and supplies between many small islands
and the mainland.
Onboard facilities, for example, include large
luggage storage areas and a specially designed room
that allows passengers to transport their pets. A kiosk
provides refreshments throughout the round-trip
which can last up to six hours, and an adjacent
television room with toys provides children with a play
area separate from the main passenger cabin. Smokers
are catered for with a protected outdoor smoking area
on the upper deck.
The ferries' refrigerated cargo facilities enable
OVDS to provide a valuable service delivering goods
to and from the mainland, particularly for Norway's
significant fishing industry. Cargo is lifted into the
hold by cranes on the upper deck, which feature
remote control capability for ease and swiftness of
loading and unloading - a vital factor on this service
due to the large number of different ports called upon
each day.
Designed to operate with four crew, the vessel's
layout facilitates the easy flow of
passengers.
Hydraulically-operated boarding ramps are positioned
both port and starboard and cater for the various
wharf heights encountered on the route, while the
central ticketing office allows passengers to purchase
tickets after boarding. Boarding passengers move
forward to the main seating area, via luggage storage
compartments where they can leave their belongings.
Sliding doors separate the main passenger cabin
from the lobby and baggage areas, creating a quiet
environment in which passengers can relax in climate-
controlled comfort. Seating is arranged in a mixture of
row and table and chair arrangements and the entire
interior is fitted out to the typically high standards
expected by Scandinavian passengers.
Passengers with disabilities are well catered for, with
noticeable features being hearing aid induction loops
and interior colour schemes designed to clearly
delineate walkways for those with poor eyesight.
Since the vessels operate north of the Arctic Circle,
and throughout winter, specific attention was paid to
ensuring year-round functioning of all aspects of the
vessel in below freezing conditions. This includes all
engineering systems and is encompassed in features
such as the covered mooring decks aft, which protect
the crew from the weather when docking, and a sloped
forward bulkhead that is designed to prevent the
build-up of snow and ice over the escape hatch.
While based on an existing hullform, the hulls and
tunnel height have been slightly modified for
Norwegian sea conditions and to allow for expected
variations in passenger and cargo loads.
The
catamarans use Seastate interceptors to modify
running trim as well as providing significant motion
damping.
Power for the vessels is provided by twin MTU 16V 4000
diesels, each driving a Kamewa waterjet via a ZF gearbox.
This produced a speed of 33knots in trial conditions.

F
ollowing the success of Sarah Jade (November
2001) EMAS required another crew boat to give
this company a premium level of
operational
continuity and security for its oil field support
contracts, so it again approached Strategic Marine
Pty Ltd, Western Australia, to construct such a
vessel.
On this occasion EMAS required a larger 
boat with a larger carrying capacity and more 
open 
deck 
space,
but 
with 
the 
same 
manoeuvrability and reliability as the first vessel. The
combination of Southerly Designs and Strategic
Marine 
design 
teams 
once 
again 
infused 
EMAS Offshore's requirements into this crew boat,
Sarah Pearl.
Sarah Pearl has a maximum speed of 25knots, can
carry 123 passengers, 40tonnes of cargo, and has
crew accommodation for 10 people. Operating out
of various ports in Malaysia and Thailand, the vessel
will be used to transport rig and production crew
and equipment to and from oil and gas platforms
and rigs.
The vessel also provides fire fighting capabilities
with the installation of a Fi-Fi system with a pump
capable of pumping 1200litres/hour through a
bridge deck-mounted remote control fire monitor
and a full deluge system for the ships protection.
The vessel is also fitted with oil pipeline
recovery/handling equipment.
The safety of the passengers and crew is catered
for by a fully monitored fire detection system
comprising heat and smoke detectors in the
machinery spaces, and smoke detectors in all
accommodation and stores spaces combined with
audible and visual alarms throughout the vessel. The
provision of inflatable life-rafts, lifejackets and
lifebuoys, and a GMDSS - area 3 communications
system 
with 
EPIRB 
and 
SART 
location
transponders adds to the wellbeing of the ship's
complement in the event of any emergency.
The entire vessel is constructed out of low
maintenance aluminium and all seawater piping is of
stainless steel. The cargo deck is covered with a
protective layer of thick marine pine planks which
protect the structure from shock loads during cargo
handling and minimises the possibility of cargo
sliding.
The vessel is powered by three MTU 162000 M60
rated at 1080hp, with three FP propellers through 
ZF 2550R/R - 2.03:1 gearboxes.
The vessel  is
environmentally responsible, with the inclusion of
an 
oily 
water 
separator 
and 
a 
Hanmann
Wassertechnik MINI L sewage treatment plant,
along with the allocation of tank space to store the
by-products of both systems until they can be
disposed of safely ashore.

W
ith an operating speed of 15knots, Spirit of
Kangaroo Island is not only the first medium-
speed vehicle-passenger ferry built by Austal Ships
but also the first ferry this Australian shipbuilder has
sold to its local market.
This catamaran has been
acquired to meet an increase in demand in passenger
traffic and improve ferry services to Australia's third
largest island.
Ordered by well-established operator Kangaroo
Island SeaLink in March 2003, the aluminium
catamaran was delivered in early December - a
remarkably short build time for a custom 
designed vessel measuring just over 50m in length
overall.
With the capacity for 244 passengers and 55 cars or
16 cars and eight trucks, Spirit of Kangaroo Island has a
design deadweight of 350tonnes and is powered to
its economical speed by a pair of Caterpillar 3512B
diesels driving 5-bladed, FP propellers via Reintjes
gearboxes. Vehicles load and unload over a wide stern
ramp onto an obstruction free open vehicle deck that
has no free height restrictions.
Operating up to 10 trips per day, SeaLink provides
the primary sea transportation ferry service between
the mainland and Kangaroo Island, which is situated
about 9nm offshore from Cape Jervis, on the tip of
the Fleurieu Peninsula in the state of South Australia.
The new Austal catamaran will cross the challenging
waters of the Backstairs Passage between Cape Jervis
and Penneshaw in approximately 45 minutes.
The focus in the interior has been to produce a
level of fitout that is both economical and practical
while also providing passengers with a comfortable
and enjoyable travelling experience. Passenger
facilities on the air-conditioned ferry include a
licensed café,
television and video monitors 
and a mixture of table and chair seating, and
comfortable aircraft style seating. Every effort 
has been made to ensure disabled passengers are
made 
comfortable 
including 
the 
provision 
of specially allocated wheelchair areas and disabled
toilets.

T
aking only 10 months from contract award to
delivery, and reaching 47knots on sea trial, the
US Navy are thought to be extremely pleased with
this High Speed Vessel (HSV) HSV 2 Swift. She will
serve operationally as an interim Mine Warfare
Command and Support Ship (MCS), and support
transformational mine warfare modular mission
payload 
initiatives.
In 
support 
of
Navy
experimentation, Swift will be used to explore
concepts, capabilities, and military utility associated
with the advanced hull and propulsion technology
integrated with advanced communications in
support of
the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS)
program.
For the Marine Corps, the HSV will conduct a
series 
of
limited-objective 
experiments,
exercises, demonstrations, and training events that
develop interoperability potential of high-speed
vessels with causeways, watercraft, amphibious ships,
and other shipping. Experimentation data will 
be used to access the military utility of HSVs and
future joint and naval military operations or
applications.
The HSV is capable of maintaining an average
speed of 35knots or greater, loaded with 500short
tons, consisting of 350 personnel and military
equipment. A minimum operating range of 1100nm
at 35knots was required by the contract, as is a
minimum transit range of 4000nm at an average
speed of 20knots. Furthermore, she must be capable
of 24 hour operations at slow speeds (3knots-
10knots) for experimentation with unmanned
autonomous vehicles, and to support dedicated and
emerging organic mine warfare missions.
A stern ramp capable of
on/off
loading 
directly astern or to the starboard quarter has 
been 
fitted.
The 
ramp 
is 
capable 
of
loading/unloading a multitude of military vehicles
up to and including M1A1 main battle tanks of up to
63,957kg.
Swift is also fitted with a load compensating crane
capable of launch and recovery of small boats and
unmanned vehicles up to 11,793kg whilst underway.
The crane is capable of lifting up to 9979kg to and
from the flight deck.
Perhaps one of the most impressive features of
Swift is the NAVAIR certified helicopter flight deck
for operation of MH-60S, CH-46, UH-1, and AH-1
helicopters. An area protected from the weather for
storage and maintenance of two MH-60S helicopters
has also been provided to enhance aviation
operations 
in 
day,
night,
and 
instrument
meteorological conditions.
The vessel will operate with crews stationed at
Naval Station Ingleside,
Texas,
and Naval
Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia.

T
his first Delta Azimuth Tug 2800, named Thetis,
is a highly manoeuvrable tug as a result of the
use of two 360deg rotatable rudder propellers in the
stern of the vessel. The tug is multi-functional and
will be used as a harbour tug as well as a sea-going
tug, and will carry out duties such as anchor-
handling, salvage operations, and fire-fighting
activities in the ports of Ijmuiden and Amsterdam,
as well as in the North Sea.
Thetis is equipped for ship handling operations in
the push-pull mode, towing over the bow as well as
over the stern, and escort duties. She has a bollard
pull of over 60tonnes, and is extremely silent due to
an extraordinary heavy ship construction and sound
insulation. The all-round view from the wheelhouse
is excellent due the large windows.
The hull is divided into five watertight
compartments: aft peak, rudder propeller room,
accommodation/fuel and fresh water tanks, and fore
peak. The hull is provided with a transom stern and
round bilges. The stern has well rounded transom
corners. Around the vessel at main deck and semi-
raised forecastle deck level, including the transition
part between both decks, the upper hull part is
provided with a sheer strake of 20mm. The hull has
a transverse framing system combined with
longitudinal stringers.
The bow is well flared and rounded, and has a long
- to the bow - extended skeg, to achieve good astern
seagoing characteristics, and is of
the closed 
box type.
Thetis is heavily fendered at the bow,
and stern and because of this, the bulwarks are
double plated.
The interiors are of a high luxury level and
wooden finish has been used in combination with
Iskes' colours. Near the entrance of the deckhouse
there is a dressing room for the crew, and the
captain's cabin includes a wash room. A combined
mess/galley has been placed in the deckhouse. The
mess area consists of a 'couch corner' combined
with a low table. The accommodation in the fore end
consists of a two crew cabins, an engineers cabin, an
officers cabin, and a laundry. A wash cabin with
shower and toilet has been situated between the
engineers and officers cabin. The two crew cabins
also includes a washing cabin.
The tug has an excellent all round view, especially
at the towing winches and the side fenders. This is
because of large windows, which extend from floor
to ceiling.

T
he versatility of this new multi-purpose cargo
ship design is demonstrated by the fact that the
first two deliveries entered service exhibiting
different 
formats.
Whilst 
the 
lead 
ship
(Almadiep/January 2003) displays a gearless, 'low-air-
draught (LAD)' configuration, the second, and
subject vessel,
UAL Lobito,
presents a more
conventional arrangement,
with a three tier
deckhouse built upon a sunken poop deck, folding
hatch covers and two deck cranes. A comparison with
other, similar sized, vessels of this type shows that
the Bodewes Trader 4300 design has a wider
beam/reduced draught hull form than is usual, and as
well as improving stability, this feature is particularly
advantageous to her present charter commitments
with Universal Africa Lines, providers of cargo liner
services linking West African ports, many having
depth restrictions, with Europe, North and South
America and the US Gulf.
Like many other shipbuilders these days, Bodewes
are benefitting from the lower labour costs prevailing
in Eastern Europe,
by sub-contracting hull
construction to yards in this region. Consequently
UAL Lobito originates from the Shipyard Turnu
Severin, Romania, with outfitting completed by
Bodewes at their own yard in The Netherlands. The
compact layout features a double skin hull utilised as
water ballast tanks, surrounding a single box-shaped
cargo hold, 59.20m long x 12.65m (61.50m x 12.65m
in the LAD version) closed by hydraulic folding
covers, with a high coaming allowing three tiers of
containers to be accommodated in the cargo space,
with a maximum two tiers carried on the hatch covers.
Allowable loading on the tank top is 15tonnes/m
2,
and on hatch covers 1.5tonnes/m
2. Two portable
cargo divisions are provided, capable of location at
any of five positions in the hold, and a mechanical
ventilation system gives six air changes per hour,
permitting dangerous cargoes to be carried. Ice
strengthening to Class 1B (Finnish and Swedish
Rules) is included, as well as strengthening for
loading/unloading aground. Cargo handling is by
means of two NMF deck cranes fitted on pedestals
built into the port-side hull structure, each having a
swl of 36tonnes and an outreach of 22m, giving a
capability for working cargo approximately 8m
beyond the starboard side of the vessel. A Framo
anti-heeling system is fitted to compensate during
cargo handling operations.
The machinery installation was subcontracted to
Wolfard & Wessels Werktuigbouw and is based upon
a MaK 6M25 main engine with an MCR of 1800kW
at 750rev/min. This drives a CP propeller installed in
a Lips HR nozzle, through a gearbox fitted with a
360kW alternator, for a service speed of 12.50knots.
Two 248kW diesel alternator sets are also provided.
Manoeuvring is assisted by a 300kW electric bow
thruster, and the rudder is of the Stabilo free-hanging
flap type.
Accommodation is arranged aft for 10 persons in
single-berth cabins with private toilet facilities, for
whom lifesaving provisions include a free-fall lifeboat
with recovery davit at the stern, a man overboard
dinghy similarly positioned, and two 12 person
inflatable liferafts.

A
fter a three-year development process, the first
platform supply vessel to be fuelled with liquefied
natural gas has now entered service. Viking Energy is the
realisation of ship owner Eidesvik A/S that gas fuelled
support vessels could provide a useful contribution to
reducing exhaust emissions. Both this vessel and a sister
ship to be owned and operated by Simon Møkster
Shipping A/S will work on a 10-year charter for Statoil.
They will help Statoil to reduce both carbon dioxide and
nitrogen oxide emissions across its range of activities,
aiding Norway's commitment to the Kyoto agreement.
Kleven Verft in Ulsteinvik, Norway, part of the Kleven
Maritime Group, built Viking Energy as its Yard No 303
to the VS 4403 design from Vik-Sandvik. As an
important part of the quest for low emissions, the design
incorporates the latest thinking in low resistance hull
form to reduce the propulsion power needed for the
required service speed and carrying capacity, and uses
efficient azimuth thrusters with contra-rotating
propellers for main propulsion.
This is a large straight supply vessel, 94m long by
20.4m beam, has a displacement of 6013tonnes at the
summer draught of 7.9m, and dynamic positioning to
IMO DP2. The vessel has DNV Clean and COMF-V(3)
notation. On sea trials the noise and vibration levels
under both transit and manoeuvring conditions were
very low.
Four main generator sets each rated at 2010kW supply
electric power for propulsion and all services. ABB was
responsible for the electrical system. The prime movers
for the generator sets are Wärtsilä 6L32DF dual fuel
engines, designed to burn gas or oil in any proportion.
For minimum emissions, LNG is used, but should the
ship move away from an area where gas can be bunkered,
the engines can run on diesel fuel, and the 116kW
Caterpillar powered emergency genset also uses diesel oil.
LNG is contained in a giant thermos flask in the
middle of the vessel, and is well protected. The tank is a
horizontal cylinder with domed ends, fabricated from
304grade stainless steel. It comprises an inner and an
outer chamber, with a gap of 300mm between the two
maintained under a high vacuum to insulate the LNG at
-162°C from the surroundings. Tank volume is 234m
3,
giving an effective fuel capacity of 220m
3 when filled to
the allowable limit. The tank in turn is fitted in a
compartment with A60 fire insulation.
Safety precautions are extensive. All gas lines and
valves are enclosed in ventilated sheaths, with alarm
sensors to give warning of leakage, and all areas where
gas could collect are monitored.
Before use, the liquid gas has to be vaporised, and
supplied to the engines at about 20°C and 5bar pressure.
This is carried out by means of a hot water vaporiser unit
attached to the gas cylinder. Two coils are fed with hot
water from the ship's system; one rated at 390kW
vaporises the fuel gas to supply up to 600m
3/h of free
gas, the other smaller unit boils enough LNG to maintain
pressure in the tank. A bunkering connection is located
on the starboard side of the ship, its enclosure inerted
with nitrogen for safety. Bunkering of gas will normally
occupy three hours once a week, of which actual LNG
transfer takes about two hours. Cryo AB was responsible
for the ship's complete LNG system up to the
connections to the main engines.
Apart from its unusual fuel, Viking Energy is a normal
PSV, able to transport all the usual supplies. Liquid mud
is carried in eight tanks flanking the LNG system
amidships. Aft of this are a further eight pressurisable
tanks totalling 400m
3 for dry bulk. About 1300m
3 of fuel
can 
be 
carried,
together 
with 
2000m
3
of
ballast/drillwater, 1100m
3 of potable water, and 200m
3 of
methanol or special products. The cargo deck is sheathed
in wood and has an area of 1030m
2. High plated
bulwarks enclose it and right aft at either side of the
vessel above the rail height are manifold stations for
supply transfer.
Two Hydramarine deck cranes are mounted at the aft
end of the superstructure, while the Norsafe MOB boat
is cradled to port and davits for the Viking liferafts are
provided on both sides of the vessel.
Viking Energy is equipped with dynamic positioning to
DNV AUTR class, using a Kongsberg Simrad DP
system. Rolls-Royce provided the propulsion and
manoeuvring outfit, comprising two main Contaz 25
azimuth thrusters powered by 3000kW ABB motors, two
1000kW tunnel thrusters, and an 880kW ULE1201
retractable thruster, all electrically driven.
The accommodation is spacious, finished mainly in
light colours with wood trim, and has 12 single berth
cabins and six two berth cabins. In the wheelhouse, there
is a console facing the bow for transit conditions, and
two identical stations looking the other way, with controls
and data screens from with the operators have a good
view over the working deck. Main controls are duplicated
at the bridge wings.
Using LNG as a fuel means a higher capital cost for the
ship. The attraction is a cut in NOx emissions of
approximately 200tonnes per year compared with vessels
using oil, and a major reduction in carbon dioxide. Statoil
can use this saving as a quota to offset against other
operations.
A second factor is that Viking Energy is expected to use
about 7000tonnes of natural gas a year. This helps to
improve the economics of building LNG bunkering
facilities at locations on the Norwegian coast to provide
fuel for a growing fleet of gas-fuelled vessels in the
future.

T
he 78m ro-ro, Volcán de Tindaya, was built by
Barreras Shipyard, Spain, for owner Marítima de
las Islas, from the Armas group, and was delivered in
June this year.
She will operate five turnarounds a
day in the Canary Islands, from Playa Blanca
(Lanzarote) to Corralejo, (Fuerteventura).
This 700 passenger capacity ferry is powered by
two medium-speed engines with a CP propeller and
can reach a speed of 16knots. Volcán de Tindaya is
arranged with two symmetrical door-ramps aft and
forward - protected by a bow visor - for cars and
trailers.
The vessel is equipped with two Wärtsilä 8L26
diesel turbocharged engines, each developing an
MCR of 2600kW at 1000rev/min. Two auxiliary
diesel engines of 2 x 550kW at 1500rev/min are
connected to the alternators of 2 x 560kW, 400V,
50Hz through corresponding couplings. The vessel
is equipped with two transverse bow thrust propellers
with an output of 330 kW each, driven by an electric
motor. Hydraulically-driven retractable fin stabilisers
were installed to reduce roll.
For service between quay and the vessel, there 
are two stern ramp-doors, each one 5.5m wide 
and 6.5m long. These doors can carry vehicle
weights of up to 48tonnes. There are also two
movable car decks at the flanks of the tweendeck,
located on the main deck.
Oliver Design, of Spain, created the interior and
exterior of this vessel. The design brief was to create
a cruise ship-like vessel with semi-open spaces for
use all year round. Bars and cafés were to be as
inviting as possible. Included onboard is a centrally-
located cascade bar. Thus waiters can serve the three
accommodation levels from the same area using a
communication system inside the bar.
Murals with
scenes of the local area were painted by the artist
Alex Carrascosa. Accommodation is distributed on
three decks.

W
ith operational flexibility enhanced by both a
changeable interior layout featuring specially
developed 
seats 
and 
four-engine 
propulsion
configuration, Zephyr is, at 43.5m in length, the largest
catamaran so far built at Austal USA's shipyard in
Mobile, Alabama. It is also the first high-speed
aluminium vessel in the fleet of New York-based
operator Circle Line-Statue of Liberty Ferry, Inc.
The new catamaran meets Circle Line's requirements
for a vessel capable of fulfilling a variety of roles and
was developed through close cooperation between
Austal USA and Circle Line.
Most noticeable when entering through the large
double doors forward is the atrium area, with a large
expanse of skylight providing the twin benefits of an
airy, spacious saloon and unparalleled views of the
Manhattan skyline. Equally striking is the circular
Amtico dance floor set below the skylight.
The main deck is extremely spacious and
incorporates a number of features to enable a variety of
functions to be held onboard. For example, to facilitate
onboard presentations there is a large screen that can
be electrically lowered from the ceiling. This is
supplemented by feed to 53cm flat screen monitors
that are suspended from ceiling and wall locations
throughout the vessel. These can also receive direct
satellite television service.
Laptop computer connections on the main and upper
decks further enhance the catamaran's appeal to
corporate clientele and there are additional power
outlets on the upper deck for commuters to hook into
during their time aboard.
The main deck showcases comfortable curved
Beurteaux seats of a design very similar to those fitted
on some large Austal vehicle ferries operating in
Europe. Small, built-in drinks tables are another
feature.
Passengers can make their way upstairs via the central
staggered staircase or the very large double stairs aft,
which also lead to the sun deck by way of a small
landing on the upper deck. With up to 600 passengers
being carried, great emphasis was placed on loading and
unloading large numbers of people in a very short time,
especially when operating in excursion mode. Circle
Line's experience in this regard was instrumental in
ensuring Zephyr can be turned around in minimal time
and that it can operate successfully at a wide variety of
berths, both existing or planned, around New York.
The upper deck also reflects the owner's desire for
versatility with the barely noticeable flush seat tracks
forward a special feature that enables rapid conversion
of the space into an open function area. Beurteaux
Diner chairs are located around beautifully finished
tables from the same supplier. Aft is another bar with
booth windows from which passengers on the external
deck are served.
The Austal catamaran is powered by four Cummins
diesels, each coupled to a Hamilton waterjet to produce
service speeds up to 30knots. This configuration allows
Zephyr to be operated with either two or four engines,
providing two distinct service speeds to match the
vessel's varied operating profiles. Noise levels onboard
are extremely low even at top speed and when cruising
the harbour the engines are claimed to be barely
noticeable.
The vessel is operated from a comfortably furnished
bridge complete with two Bostrom helm seats from
which the crew can work state-of-the-art navigation
equipment. Wing station controls are also provided.
