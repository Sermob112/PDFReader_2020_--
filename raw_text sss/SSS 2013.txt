D
elivered just as 2013 drew to a close, ANDA is the 
first of three survey vessels contracted from 
Swede Ship Marine by Kartverket, also known as the 
Norwegian Mapping Authority. Intended for 
operation in the demanding seas alongside the 
Norwegian coast, as well as the waters around 
Svalbard, ANDA and her forthcoming sisters feature 
scantlings designed in accordance with the Nordic 
Boat Standard, with ice-strengthened reinforcements 
applied to the bow and around the waterline. 
The hull is fitted with a flush-mounted multi-beam 
echo sounder and a sound velocity instrument, both 
located amidships. According to Swede Ship Marine, 
ANDA’s hull shape has been optimised, following 
extensive CFD analysis, to reduce water flow 
disturbances and to limit the volume of bubbles 
passing below the echo sounder. In subsequent trials, 
sounding data was recorded as remaining ‘high quality’ 
even when the vessel was operating at just over 
16knots. The increased quality of the collected data 
reduces the amount of time and resources typically 
required for post-processing of raw data from 
soundings, which, combined with a service speed of 
25knots (relatively high for a survey vessel), could 
grant owners a competitive advantage in this field. 
The survey equipment is a shallow water system 
containing a Konsgberg EM2040 high-res multi-beam 
echo sounder, designed for operations in water depths 
of up to 600m and capable of 40,000 soundings per 
second (comprising a high ping frequency of up to 
50Hz, at 800 beams per ping). Swede Ship Marine 
accredits the dualhead solution with covering a width 
10 times that of the survey depth, resulting in superior 
coverage of field to more traditional survey craft. 
The installation of two waterjets enables ANDA to 
operate in shallow waters, including waters close to 
shore and quaysides. The gearboxes are enhanced by a 
trolling function, removing the need to engage the 
deflectors on the waterjets when the vessel is operating 
at slow speeds, thereby limiting flow disturbances that 
could compromise the soundings and subsequent data 
quality. The waterjets are also bolstered by interceptors 
with active list and trim functions, for reduced 
motions during survey operations and a smoother ride 
when the vessel is in high speed transit. 
Given that the vessel crew will typically remain 
aboard the vessel on a daily basis for 12 hours a day, all 
year round, great care was also taken to make the 
wheelhouse as comfortable as possible. Work spaces 
have been arranged on an ergonomic basis, with the 
wheelhouse flexibly mounted to the hull and all noise- 
and heat-generating equipment placed below deck 
level in a separate compartment.

013 saw The Netherlands-based Damen 
Shipyards deliver a pair of 40m loa sister 
offshore support vessels (OSVs) to operator 
Rederij Groen, both of which were designed to 
function specifically as seismic research support 
vessels. Part of this work involves ‘guard ship’-style 
duties; for instance, the vessels are charged with 
warding off fishing vessels from seismic survey 
ship sites, in order to protect the latter vessel 
types’ 
scientific 
streamers 
from 
becoming 
entangled in, and/ or damaged by, trawler nets. 
In the past, such activities have typically been 
carried out by converted vessels, such as former 
fishing trawlers. This duo, designed collaboratively 
by Saltwater Engineering, Rederij Groen and and 
Damen’s Maaskant Shipyards Stellendam subsidiary, 
are reported to be the first of their kind to have been 
specifically built for purpose. Accordingly, Damen 
has designated Astra G, delivered in April, and 
Aquarius G, which was handed over in May, ‘Seismic 
Research Support (SRS) Chaser’ status. Both sisters 
are currently operating in the Barents Sea. 
Astra G and Aquarius G feature a 9.3m beam, a 3.3m 
draught, a depth of 4.6m at the sides, with 
accommodation for up to 14 members of crew. The 
vessels are powered by twin Caterpillar diesel engines 
and, combined with two fixed pitch propellers, two 
fishtail rudders and a Veth bow thruster, the vessels are 
capable of drawing on a total power output of 
1,940kW, resulting in a low design speed of 14knots 
– the emphasis being on stability and manoeuvrability 
when conducting board-to-board transhipment of 
equipments and parts. 
As the sister OSVs will also be tasked with providing 
support services to a seismic mothership, each of the 
vessels has been designed with a 2tonne deck crane, 
featuring a reach of 10.5m, enabling crew to move 
parts and equipment onto the mothership whilst 
sailing alongside. 
Each craft’s deck area covers approximately 105m² 
of space, enabling the storage of ISO containers, if so 
required. Onboard capacities include 230m³ of fuel 
oil and 35.5m³ of fresh water, while designated cool 
store and freeze store areas can store up to 8m³ 
apiece. Equipped to handle firefighting duties if 
necessary, each SRS Chaser has been fitted with a pair 
of pumps, each rated 25m³/hr, and a portable 
emergency fire pump.

A
ugust 2013 saw the launch and delivery of the first of a 
series of new inshore fast rescue craft, constructed by 
Netherlands-based Habbeké Shipyard, to the Royal Dutch 
Rescue Society (KNRM). 
Designed by Pieter Meuzelaar of maritime architectural 
firm Dutch Special Marine Group (DSMG) to its Fast 
Rescue Craft 903 specifications, the vessels constitute the 
first of KNRM’s new Nikolaas class of lifeboat, with Bert and 
Anneke Knape deployed in the Dutch municipality of 
Lelystad, and its sister, HAYO, delivered in Hoorn, where 
they are now active in performing search and rescue (SAR) 
operations in these territories’ lakes, rivers and ports. The 
construction process was reported to have gone smoothly, 
bar the significant inconvenience of having navigation and 
communications equipment stolen from the first two 
aforementioned boats prior to delivery. 
According to Habbeké, the Nikolaas class incorporates a 
different design to the KNRM’s previous rescue craft. One of 
the key differences is that the vessels’ flat plates have been 
made constructed to be thicker and stronger. Also, the 
navigation mast has been placed on the vessel’s console rather 
than on the stern, in order to create more working space at 
the craft’s aft. 
The fendering is packed with Polyethylene foam, treated 
with an external durable coating. Part of the reason for this 
has been to keep instances of lifeboat downtime to an 
absolute minimum. 
The Nikolaas class vessels measure just over 9m in length, 
with a breadth of 2.7m, a depth of 0.6m, a gross tonnage of 
4tonnes and the capacity to carry up to four members of 
crew, seated on shock-resistant chairs, and 16 passengers / 
survivors. A Volvo Penta D6-435 inboard engine delivers 
320kW and drives a MJP Ultrajet UJ377 waterjet, granting 
the class a top speed of 34knots.

P
roving that LNG-powered vessel operation  need 
not solely be the preserve of larger tankers, ferries 
and container ships, the delivery of the 35m loa Borgøy 
(and her subsequent sister LNG tug, Bokn) represents 
a step forward in the realisation of low-cost, 
environmentally friendly fuels for smaller vessels. As 
the majority of tugs spend their time idling, relying on 
short bursts of power, LNG, in theory, makes a 
suitable, eco-friendly fuel for these close-to-coast 
vessels. The main question, though, has centred on 
how to reduce LNG tank size without impacting on 
performance, particularly for vessels that rely on high 
bollard pull capacities to conduct their escort and 
towing duties. 
Built by Turkish shipbuilder Sanmar the 3,410kW 
Borgøy, which was delivered to Norwegian tug operator 
Buksér og Berging, has been put to work on behalf of 
Statoil, at the energy major’s Kårstø gas terminal. 
Marine Design handled the vessel’s design, while Rolls-
Royce was tasked with delivering the vessel’s gas 
engines, LNG tanks and propulsion systems. 
To realise this, Rolls-Royce designed an 80m³ tank, 
built by Aga Cryo AB,  bespoke for the Sanmar tugs. 
This was supplied to each vessel alongside a pair of 
Bergen lean-burn gas engines and two azimuthing 
thrusters. The tank has been stacked on board 
vertically, to fit the vessel and primarily to realise a 
reduction in sloshing, and features a double, stainless 
steel skin, with Perlite stored between the skins for 
extra protection, in the event of one skin sustaining 
damage. To meet DNV class requirements and the 
specifications of the International Code of Safety for 
Gas-fuelled ships, the engine room spaces have been 
configured with a ventilation system enabling 30 air 
changes per hour, as well as gas detection and 
automatic shutdown equipment. 
Combined, this propulsive arrangement grants the 
vessel a range of five to six days when operating at 
10knots, a minimum bollard pull of 65tonnes and a 
steering force of 100tonnes. Vetle Sverdrup, operations 
manager, Buksér og Berging, commented, during 
Borgøy’s naming ceremony: “We will sail the vessels 
with our own crew from Turkey to Norway, and expect 
to make just one LNG purchase, refuelling at Belgium. 
We can potentially source LNG from five different 
ports along the route, taking up about six to eight 
hours per fuelling.”
As a result of incorporating this propulsive set-up, the 
vessel does not depend on pumps, and piping has been 
kept to a minimum, for preservation of onboard space. 
Sanmar constructed each tug in seven blocks, lifting the 
main equipment aboard each vessel via crane. 
Each tug also features an onboard diesel generator 
for back-up, and has been kitted out with a 130tonne 
winch, supplied by Karmoy, and mounted on the 
bow. Firefighting duties are expected of Borgøy and 
Bokn, in addition to escort roles, and so the vessels 
feature a pair of Jason fire pumps, powered by the gas 
engines and boasting dispersal rates of 2,400m³ per 
hour, apiece. Designed for operation by up to six 
members of crew, each tug includes a pair of single 
officer cabins and a pair of twin berth cabins, as well 
as galley and mess room. With crew comfort in mind, 
especially in the wake of the recently passed ILO 
MLC 2006 regulations, dampeners have also been 
used to reduce accommodation area noise levels to 
the 65dB mark. 
All of which means that  Borgøy can be assured its 
spot in the rapidly expanding history of LNG-fuelled 
vessels, having broken another barrier in the 
industry’s perceptions regarding how far the 
utilisation of natural gas can be taken.

U
rban passenger shuttle boats are undergoing 
significant transformations in design, the most 
notable being a push for the boat to blend in with  
its surroundings. 
For instance, some designers have raised the point 
that a number of city dwellers have little interest in 
marine technical features and would prefer a 
waterborne, short-hop solution that is styled more in 
the aesthetics of cars, trams / trains or buses. In terms 
of these vessels’ potential appearances, the shuttle boat 
Calais Majest’In, which was delivered in May 2013, 
provides an interesting glimpse of how this design 
trend may evolve. 
Sterling Design International drew up the blueprint for 
the 19.7m loa aluminium vessel, which has been certified 
to local waterway regulations, and which is intended to 
undertake a 4km route during day hours in the city of 
Calais, between the Calais Citadelle and the Pont de 
Coulogne. This journey is estimated to take roughly 35 
minutes each way. 
Building was completed by compatriot French 
company Alumarine Shipyard, and the resultant vessel 
can be configured in two modes;  the transport version, 
which sees the cabin open up to accommodate up to 
70 passengers, for the vessel’s aforementioned day 
route; and the restaurant version, for night cruises, 
evening receptions and corporate events, which would 
see catering equipment installed on board, granting an 
internal capacity for up to 44 guests. The vessel’s 
92kW Iveco engine gives Calais Majest’In an average 
speed of 6.5knots. 
The shuttle boat has been fitted with boarding ramps 
on the bow, for easy and safe passenger access – another 
benefit for those city travellers who may otherwise be 
wary of boarding river boats. Sterling has also simplified 
the vessel’s berthing facilities, in order to drastically cut 
the amount of fuel typically consumed when the pilot is 
attempting to manoeuvre the vessel into place. As a 
further boost to efficient manoeuvrability, Calais Majest’In 
has been kitted out with a joystick-operated hydraulic 
bow thruster, for quick and easy docking, as well as to 
avoid any other small craft that may be travelling on the 
waterway at the same time.

J
uly 2013 saw the first delivery in Baltic Workboats’ 
new Pilot 2000WP class of pilot / patrol boats, 
with the delivery of Deurloo. Handed over, along 
with two sisters, to Belgium DAB Vloot, the first 
three vessels in the series are operating in the 
Vlissingen area of the North Sea, serving pilots from 
both Belgium and The Netherlands.
The Pilot 2000WP features a wave piercing hull 
concept, which, Baltic Workboats explains, “combines 
the wave piercing bow’s slender waterlines with the flare 
of a traditional high-speed bow, with falling stem and 
the smooth ride of the double chine hull design”. The 
concept is intended to minimise spray and subsequent 
pooling of green water on the deck, as well as to severely 
decrease vertical accelerations at high speeds in 
tempestuous conditions. 
The Pilot 2000WP’s structural elements were 
designed with heavy use in mind; the builder estimates 
that, during the construction stage, great effort was 
made to ensure that the vessel’s hull can withstand 
10,000 impacts per year, partly thanks to heavy 
fendering at two different heights. In sea trials, Deurloo’s 
hull concept saw the vessel capable of operating at 
25knots in 2.5m significant wave heights. The class has 
been designed to be self-righting and, despite the deep 
bow, the boat’s rudders enable crew to turn the boat 
around in four boat lengths when operating at top 
speed, as well as making docking simpler. 
Two tanks offer a combined onboard fuel capacity of 
3,000litres, and the vessel is also fitted with a 500litre 
fresh water tank and a 300litre grey/black water tank. In 
terms of fuel consumption, the Pilot 2000WP consumes 
200litres per hour when operating at a speed of 28knots. 
In order to optimise crew comfort, efforts were also 
made to minimise onboard noise and vibrations. On 
the bridge, for example, maximum noise levels have 
been kept below 63dB when the vessel is operating at 
full speed, and were measured at 58dB when Deurloo 
was operating at 22knots. On the rear deck, 
meanwhile, noise levels were recorded at 73dB when 
the vessel was operating at 6-12knots, with 108dB 
recorded in the engine room. 
Deurloo’s wheelhouse has been resiliently mounted, 
accommodating up to 11 persons, and the propulsive 
arrangement comprises a pair of 479kW Volvo Penta 
D16MH engines, twin ZF655 gears and two Veem five-
bladed fixed pitch propellers.

S
lashing fuel costs has been high on the marine 
sector’s agenda in 2013, and it was with this 
objective in mind that Captain Cook Cruises, a 
subsidiary of Sealink Marine, approached Incat 
Crowther during the planning stages of the 23.9m 
catamaran passenger ferry Elizabeth Cook. 
The vessel, built by Australia’s Richardson Devine 
Marine, and fashioned from marine grade aluminium, 
has been particularly designed to operate across 
Sydney Harbour in a cost-efficient manner. 
As well as optimising the vessel for low fuel 
consumption, and to minimise its carbon footprint, 
Incat Crowther, working closely in cooperation with 
Sealink, specified a selection of onboard machinery 
and systems focused on reducing ongoing 
maintenance costs. 
Elizabeth Cook has been certified to carry up to 127 
passengers when operating in coastal waters, and up 
to 198 in harbour operations. 
Borrowing slightly from cruise ship aesthetics, the 
ferry has been fitted with a main passenger cabin, 
which provides seating for 116 passengers, while an 
additional 27 seats have been affixed to the aft deck, 
and a further 55 seats positioned on the open upper 
deck, to the rear of the wheelhouse. This latter area 
also contains enough space for passengers to stand 
and move around the deck, to fully absorb the sights 
during the vessel’s sails, Incat Crowther comments. 
The toilet area is located adjacent to the stairs on 
the upper deck. Meanwhile, to facilitate the crew’s 
running of the vessel, the design incorporates a set of 
large hinged engine hatches, providing safe and 
spacious access to the engine rooms, for daily 
maintenance tasks. 
The boarding gates have been positioned on the 
foredeck in full view of the wheelhouse, as an extra 
safety consideration during the passenger 
embarkation/disembarkation process. In terms of 
onboard capacities, Elizabeth Cook can carry up to 
2,000litres of fuel oil, 250litres of fresh water and 
1,500litres of sullage at any given time. 
As a result of the launch and delivery of Elizabeth 
Cook, Sealink Marine has now commissioned two 
further ferries, designed along similar energy-/cost-
efficient lines, the keels of which have already been 
laid at Richardson Devine Marine.

O
n first glance, Francisco was always going to be a 
firm favourite for Significant Small Ships of 2013, 
purely on the basis of a 99m loa wave-piercing 
catamaran achieving a maximum speed of 58knots – 
and that is only the rating recorded so far, at the 
beginning of this young prototype vessel’s life. Indeed, 
both builder Incat Tasmania and Argentina-based 
ferry operator Buquebus have estimated that the vessel 
may achieve speeds in excess of 60knots in the shallow 
waters of the River Plate, where Francisco will offer a 
service between Buenos Aires, Argentina and 
Montevideo, Uruguay, as an alternative to costly air 
transport and non-existent / unreliable rail links. 
Add to the above the vessel’s green credentials, in the 
form of a pair of stainless steel 40m
3 LNG tanks for 
dual-fuel operations, and the catamaran has certainly 
seized attention since its delivery in late Summer. 
Propulsion comes courtesy of two GE Energy 
LM2500 marine gas turbines, rated 22,000kW apiece, 
and a pair of Wärtsilä LJX 1720 SR waterjets, 
configured for steering and reverse. In November 
2013, Incat Tasmania reports, the vessel managed to 
achieve an impressive 53knots at 87% power, with a 
full passenger complement and 130 cars on deck. Also, 
in June 2013 sea trials, Francisco managed to achieve a 
service speed of 50knots at full power on marine 
distillate, at a displacement of 1,516tonnes, only 
slightly falling to 49knots at 90% power. When this 
trial was repeated in dual-fuel mode, the combination 
of marine distillate and LNG resulted in a service 
speed of 51.8knots at 100% MCR. When the ballast 
water was removed, and solely LNG used, the ferry hit 
58.1knots at full power. 
The vessel’s maximum marine fuel oil load is 
approximately 140,000litres, shared equally between 
two tanks, while a single tank provides 5,000litres of 
fresh water capacity. Passenger and ship services are 
powered by four Caterpillar C18 340kWe gensets, 
fitted with marine brushless self-excited alternators, 
with one of the gensets maintained for standby 
purposes. These are complemented by two Caterpillar 
C9 gas turbine gensets, which operate independently 
and are rated 200kWe apiece. 
The two parts of Francisco’s double-skinned hull are 
connected via a bridging section, with the centre bow 
structure situated at the forward end. Each hull is 
divided into nine watertight, vented compartments, 
divided by transverse bulkheads. It is here, in a void 
space, that the twin LNG tanks are situated. Both 
tanks have been fitted with vaporisers, and LNG fuel is 
delivered to the engines by specially built vacuum-
sealed, double-skinned pipes. 
To compete with the airline sector, Francisco has 
opted for luxurious interiors, with a 1,100m
2 onboard 
duty-free shop built into the Tier 2 passenger deck. 
In addition, the vessel accommodates four distinct 
areas for economy, tourist, business and first class 
passengers, as well as a VIP executive lounge and a 
crew cabin. The vehicle deck, meanwhile, has a clear 
height of 2.3m and each car space accommodates for 
a vehicle measuring a maximum 4.5m in length x 
2.3m in width.

rampian Sovereign is the first of two diesel-electric, 
platform supply vessels (PSVs) designed by OMT-
ISD and built by Spanish yard Astilleros Balenciaga for 
its long-standing customer, Scotland-based offshore 
operator the Craig Group. Delivered at the end of May 
2013, Grampian Sovereign was followed by a sister 
vessel, Grampian Sceptre, in October. 
The concept design work was carried out by OSD-
IMT in close cooperation with the shipowner’s technical 
and commercial personnel. The main objectives of the 
design were for a fuel-efficient ship that would have 
good manoeuvrability and station-keeping capabilities 
in heavy weather conditions, given that the pair of PSVs 
is operating in the North Sea. The fuel efficiency was 
achieved by combining a carefully studied hull shape in 
combination with diesel-electric propulsion, in turn 
reducing the emission levels. The resulting design was 
the IMT982, the first of a new generation of vessel. 
One of the most notable features is the IMT982’s 
S-Bow profile, comprising a semi-bulbous bow 
emerging well above the waterline, thus enabling a 
longer waterline length than a conventional bow on a 
vessel of this kind, and permitting speeds of over 
14knots to be achieved in trials.
The superstructure has been set well forward, allowing 
for a 950m² cargo deck with a  design strength of 
5tonnes/m² and maximum deck load capacity of 
1,300tonnes. The accommodation is laid out for a crew 
capacity for up to 17 persons, all in single cabins with 
en-suite facilities. 
Below decks, the vessel is subdivided into the bow 
thruster compartment aft of the fore peak, separated 
from the engine control room compartment by a 
watertight remote-operated hydraulic door at the front 
engine room watertight bulkhead, the cargo tank and 
pumping area, the stern thruster and steering 
compartments and the aft peak. The vessels’ tank 
capacities are 950m³ of fuel oil, 1,130m³ of ballast /drill 
water, 640m³ of fresh water and 265m³ of dry bulk. The 
pumping arrangements comprise two pumps for each 
type of product, with capacities of 200m³/hr each, 
except mud and brine, which have 75m³/h pumps. 
The vessel is driven by a diesel-electric propulsion 
plant with the electrical power needs produced by four 
MaK 9M20 diesel generating sets, rated 1,560kWe 
each. Each engine drives an alternator, which, via the 
main 690V switchboard, feeds the Steerprop fixed pitch 
propeller azimuth thrusters aft and tunnel thrusters 
forward.
In addition to the propulsion side, the ship’s domestic 
electrical needs are covered by the either the ship’s main 
generating plant or, when in port, by a Caterpillar C18 
340kWe combined harbour/emergency generating set, 
fitted on the forecastle deck. For manoeuvring purposes, 
the vessel has two tunnel thrusters forward, rated 
800kW each, which can be driven separately by 
dedicated controls both at forward and aft control 
stations, or in conjunction with the main azimuth 
thrusters by means of an independent joystick system.
All propulsion units can be operated by means of their 
individual controls from the fore and aft stations in the 
wheelhouse, as well as from the independent joystick 
system provided, which has a fixed control panel in the 
aft control console of the wheelhouse. Additionally a 
dynamic positioning (DP) system has also been fitted, 
and the vessel is in compliance with DP2 requirements.
In accordance with the UMS class notation, the vessel 
is fitted with an alarm and monitoring system, as part of 
an integrated automation system, which is also 
interfaced to the tank level and draught measuring, a 
cargo pumping system and a loading computer, as 
typically found in this vessel type. All cargo valves and 
pumps are remotely operated from mimics displayed in 
operator stations fitted in the aft bridge console and 
engine control room.
The accommodation outfit has been designed with 
all modern commodities provided in the common 
spaces and individual cabins too, such as internet and 
satellite TV, as well as sound systems. Additionally, a 
gym and sauna are provided for the off-duty crew’s 
enjoyment. Crew quarters are sited on the forecastle 
and upper forecastle decks, below the wheelhouse. 
The forecastle deck is devoted to one-man cabin crew 
accommodation and the instrument room. The upper 
forecastle deck holds captain’s and chief engineer’s 
cabins, with separate sleeping room, as well as officer 
cabins and client cabins, all of them with en-suite 
washroom facilities.
On the top level, the bridge houses all vessel 
controls, navigation systems, communication 
equipment and two of the vessel alarm and 
monitoring displays. The forward console has all 
propulsion controls as well as both X-band and 
S-band radars, chart plotter and onboard comms 
systems, as well as a sliding helm seat between the 
consoles, providing a comfortable steering and 
lookout position with all manoeuvring controls at 
easy reach from the helmsman’s seat.

T
he delivery of the 51m passenger ship Isefjord has 
highlighted Bangladesh’s rising prowess as a cost-
efficient, quality boatbuilding nation, with the ro-ro 
vessel having been described as the most advanced yet, 
and one of the largest of its type, to have left the Asian 
nation for a European client. Constructed at Western 
Marine Shipyard in Chittagong, for Danish owner 
Hundested-Rorvig Faergefart, Isefjord has been deployed 
off the coast of Denmark, where the vessel is capable of 
carrying 147 passengers and 28 vehicles on each crossing.
 As a spokesperson for Western Marine put it, during 
the vessel’s handover ceremony: “With Bangladesh being 
an emerging and very infant shipbuilding industry, it was 
a great challenge to take the initiative to build such a 
sophisticated ship.”
Isefjord is fully automated, with a dual operating system 
installed on the bridge, and, combined with azimuth 
thrusters at both ship ends, this set-up enables the crew to 
operate the vessel from either end. The vessel is also 
capable of rotating 360degs from a fixed point. The 
systems aboard the ship can be monitored and controlled 
from mobile phones and laptops, and, despite the high-
end technology deployed onboard, designers Jorgen 
Petersen and Norman Marine conceived the vessel to be 
operated by a two-man crew. 
The ferry weighs just under 470tonnes and its two 
main Cummins engines, rated 375kW each, allow for an 
operating speed of 11knots.

A
s an extension of the designer’s previous 32m loa 
tug models, Robert Allan Ltd’s new series of the 
RAmparts 3500 class ASD tug design has been realised 
in the form of Jin Gang Lun 26, an expanded creation 
measuring 35m x 12.4m and featuring tailor-made 
hull, wheelhouse and accommodation layout 
considerations to suit the particular operational 
requirements of ports in China. 
Classed according to Chinese Classification Society 
(CCS) requirements, Jin Gang Lun 26’s hull is 
bolstered by heavy-duty fendering; 700mm x 350mm 
cylindrical fendering protects the bow at the main 
deck level, while 600mm x 400mm M block fenders 
have been positioned between the main deck and the 
knuckle. Two steel half-pipe fenders, with elements of 
400mm x 400mm rubber ‘D’ fenders, provide 
protection at the main and forecastle sheer deck lines, 
providing a section of ‘outset’ fenders to act as a lifting 
point for the tug when it is pulled alongside an 
attended ship. A 500mm x 250mm cylindrical fender 
is used at the stern, and, additionally, heavy duty tyres 
are provided all around the tug. 
For ship-handling service in LNG terminals, Jin 
Gang Lun 26 is fitted with a safety system which 
features gas detection alarms in the wheelhouse, 
sensors around the deckhouse and explosion-proof 
motors for the air intake fans situated on the main 
deck and in the deckhouse. The wheelhouse has been 
designed for all-round visibility, with a U-shaped 
control station providing maximum visibility to both 
fore and aft deck working areas. 
The tug has been outfitted with full accommodation 
for a crew of up to 14 persons. The master’s cabin is 
situated on the main deck, alongside a spacious mess / 
conference room, while the chief engineer’s quarters, 
and three additional four-man cabins, are located on 
the lower accommodation deck.
Onboard tanks have been designed to accommodate 
171m³ of fuel oil, 30m³ of fresh water and 20m³ of 
foam. Robert Allan explains that the tug was designed 
and built to CCS Ice Class B and FiFi 1 specifications, 
though the vessel is not formally classed to these 
notations. In order to combat fire, two pumps, 
supplied by Norway’s Fire Fighting Systems (FFS), are 
driven by the tug’s main engine and feed a pair of FFS 
1200 and 300LB firefighting monitors. 
At time of going to press, a sister RAmparts 3500 
model, bound for Tianjin Port, was also nearing 
completion.

013 saw the delivery of the UK Royal National 
Lifeboat Institution’s (RNLI’s) most advanced all-
weather craft to date, in the form of Jock and Annie 
Slater, the first in the organisation’s new Shannon class 
of 25knot response lifeboats. Named after former 
RNLI chairman Sir Jock Slater and his wife, Lady 
Slater, the class represents a significant stepping stone 
for the emergency rescue organisation, in terms of 
speed, deployment options and capacity to assist the 
survivors of marine incidents in UK and Irish waters. 
As mentioned at the vessel’s christening in July, 
under the 38-year chairmanship of RNLI operations 
director Michael Vlasto, the organisation has managed 
to more than treble the speed of its lifeboats, since the 
days of the 8knot Oakley, Barnet, Watson and Rother 
classes. The Shannon class will now be rolled out to 
rejuvenate the RNLI fleet, with approximately 50 
further vessels in this series planned for delivery over 
the course of the forthcoming 10 years – many of 
which will replace older 18knot models. 
The Shannon class is described as the smallest and 
lightest of the RNLI’s 25knot lifeboats designed 
specifically to be launched and recovered from a 
beach. The incorporation of Hamilton waterjets into 
the lifeboat’s design also grants the RNLI more scope 
to undertake rescue operations in shallow waters, 
whilst minimising the risk of damage to propulsive 
equipment, as well as a higher degree of 
manoeuvrability than has been the case before. 
In accordance with RNLI requirements for all-
weather lifeboats, the Shannon class has been 
designed to fully self-right itself in the event of a 
capsizal, even in the most treacherous of weather 
conditions. The class was also designed to comply 
with forthcoming amendments to the Maritime and 
Coastguard Agency (MCA) Rescue Boat Code. 
Operation has also been made easier via the 
installation of SciSys UK’s SIMS system, which has 
been tailor-made around the existing RNLI user 
interface, for crew familiarity. 
Despite its size, the Shannon class is able to 
accommodate up to 85 survivors, in addition to its 
six-man crew, both internally and externally. Seating 
has been provided for up to six casualties. Since 
delivery, Jock and Annie Slater has been undergoing 
rigorous sea trials, as well as recovery simulations, in 
advance of the wider roll-out of the class in early 
2014. In sheer terms of cranking up the RNLI’s 
ability to save lives, the Shannon class debutant 
certainly deserves its place in this publication.

talian designer and builder Fincantieri has raised the bar 
for multi-purpose coastal rescue and law enforcement 
boats with the launch of the 94m x 16.6m Luigi Dattilo, 
which was handed over to the General Command of the 
Port Authority Corp for the Italian Coast Guard in 
September 2013. 
The vessel has been designed to operate safely in open seas, 
particularly in harsh weather conditions, when undertaking 
search and rescue, anti-pollution and fire-fighting missions, 
as well as engaging in actions to combat illegal immigration. 
The vessel is equipped with four rigid-hulled inflatable boats 
(RHIBs), each capable of speeds of up to 35knots for fast 
emergency response, and can accommodate up to 60 
shipwreck survivors in a series of dedicated rooms. 
Luigi Dattilo is intended to maintain operations over 
extended periods of time, featuring a range of more than 
3,000miles when operating at a top speed of 18knots and with 
a full load displacement of 3,600tonnes. A helideck has been 
included in the vessel’s design, with a landing pad suited for 
AB212 or AW139 helicopters. The vessel is also equipped 
with command/control systems and radar types capable of 
detecting surface marine pollution. 
With a nod to environmental considerations, Luigi Dattilo 
has also come to incorporate hybrid propulsion. In addition to 
the main diesel engines, the ship is equipped with a pair of 
Seastema-ABB electric motors, each generating 250kW, 
connected directly to the main gearboxes. Alone, these electric 
models are able to grant the vessel a patrol speed of 
approximately 8knots, thus increasing the time which the 
vessel can dedicate to active missions. 
Fincantieri claims that it is now looking to Seastema to 
provide a customised dynamic positioning system for the 
vessel, which will undergo this upgrade in the near future. 
A second, sister vessel is planned for delivery in late 2014.

A
nswering the demand for scientific research and 
survey vessels, German yard Fassmer last year put the 
finishing touches to MYA II, a 21.7m x 6m survey craft 
which has joined the fleet of Germany’s Alfred Wegener 
Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), following 
the placing of a US$6.2 million contract, and which has 
since been deployed in the Wadden Sea. The vessel 
replaces the original, 1978-built MYA, a smaller, 17.5m 
x 6.5m, 6knot survey craft. 
The single-hulled vessel was built specifically to 
operate in shallow waters, hence its draught, as it will 
find itself navigating close to the islands of Sylt, 
Helgoland and Rømø, in areas where mudflats are 
plentiful. Due to the ecological sensitivity of these 
operational areas, MYA II has been certified with 
Germanischer Lloyd’s Environmental Passport 
accreditation, as well as German ‘Blue Angel’ 
certification for products or services that boast 
environmentally friendly aspects. Generating a total 
output of 360kW also suits the research vessel to this 
sensitive zone, with noise emissions being kept as low 
as possible. 
Despite the vessel’s relatively small size, it can 
accommodate two crew members and up to 12 
scientists. The deck has been bolstered by a hydraulic 
A-frame with 1tonne lifting capacity and a Palfinger 
PK 18500 MB crane with an outreach of 10m. The 
vessel features a state-of-the-art laboratory, with both 
dry and wet areas (including a seawater supply), which 
provides direct access to the work deck and 
wheelhouse. A SeaBeam echo sounder enables 
scientists to conduct shallow water research, and an 
aluminium workboat can be launched from MYA II 
for further shallow water exploration and research.

H
ailed as Canada’s most powerful ever tug, 
featuring bollard pull (bp) of 110.3tonnes when 
sailing ahead,  the icebreaking vessel OCEAN 
TundRA has been put to use by Ocean Group, 
handling  escort duties along Canada’s east coast and 
the St Lawrence River and Seaway system. Built at 
Ocean’s own facilities in Quebec,  the 36m x 13m 
OCEAN TundRA was designed by compatriot naval 
architect Robert Allan Limited (RAL), and has been 
classed by Lloyd’s Register. 
OCEAN TundRA’s propulsive arrangement includes 
twin MAK 9M25C diesel engines, rated 3,000kW at 
750rpm apiece, each driving a Rolls-Royce US 305 
controllable-pitch propeller in ASD configuration. 
This results in a free running speed of just over 
15knots ahead in calm water conditions, and an 
escort steering force of approximately 122tonnes 
when the vessel is operating at 10knots. The main 
and auxiliary engines have been resiliently mounted, 
for decreased noise and vibrations. The tug’s 
icebreaking hull form, meanwhile, was partly inspired 
by a design utilised by smaller tugs working in the 
ice-prone Sakhalin region, Russia, and has been 
extensively model-tested to ensure uninterrupted 
escort performance in ice conditions common to 
eastern Canadian climes. 
The tug has been designed to accommodate a 
maximum of 10 crew members, dependent on 
mission; for short runs, three or four seafarers will 
suffice, while seven people would most likely partake 
in longer voyages. The deckhouse is accessed via a 
spacious corridor and wet lobby, which has been laid 
out so as to isolate the engine room and exhaust noise 
from the crew’s mess area. The lower deck houses four 
twin crew cabins, a laundry zone, separate toilet and 
shower rooms and galley stores. The wheelhouse has 
a split-level design, for optimised, 360degs visibility. 
The fenders at the bow comprise extruded, 
300mm-thick ‘W’ fenders and large heavy duty rubber 
tyres, while the main and forecastle deck sheer lines are 
protected by a 300mm x 300mm hollow ‘D’ fender 
and rubber tyre configuration. The stern incorporates 
350mm x 350mm hollow ‘D’ type fendering. 
The deck layout is complemented by a Palfinger 
15500 hydraulic knuckle boom crane, with 14tonnes 
maximum capacity and an out reach of 14.4m. Two 
fire-fighting pumps, each rated 2,978m³/hr at 11bar, 
are driven from front end power takeoffs from the 
main engines, and feed three monitors located on a 
large header above the wheelhouse top;  one water-
only model, rated 2,400m³/hr, and two mixed foam/
water monitors, rated 1,200m³/hr. 
Onboard tank capacities include 294m³ of fuel oil, 
18m³ of fresh water, 11m³ of fire-fighting foam and 
5.4m³of oily water.

A
s one of the many 2013 deliveries to incorporate 
green craft technology, the hybrid river ferry 
Peter Fraser is a tribute to both Navtech’s design 
skills and eco-friendly Canada’s commitment to 
keeping its waterways and rivers free of excessive 
carbon emissions. 
Built as part of a CAD$10 million (US$9.5 
million) programme, this sum having been invested 
directly by the Québec Government, Peter Fraser was 
subsequently designed to operate in shallow waters 
along the St. Lawrence River, spanning a route 
between the Québec municipalities of Isle-Verte and 
Notre Dame des Sept Douleurs, with operation being 
overseen by tourism specialist Société des traversiers 
du Québec. 
Credited with being the first passenger and vehicle 
ro-ro ferry within the Americas to truly adopt a 
hybrid diesel-electric and lithium ion battery power 
system, the 33m loa vessel features the capacity to 
carry up to 70 passengers and 12 cars; the latter 
category comprising 10 mid-sized cars, sized 5.7m+, 
and two sub-compact vehicles of 4.5m. Additionally, 
a truck or trailer can be taken onboard for the voyage. 
The centre lane load is valued at 13tonnes per single 
axle, with the lateral lane load, on the vessel’s port 
side, estimated as being 2.5tonnes per axle.  
Peter Fraser features two 25-seat passenger lounges; 
one situated adjacent to two wash rooms, connected 
to a sewage treatment plant;  and one featuring glass 
walls and offering panoramic external views. The 
crew quarters are situated on the main deck, and 
have been bolstered with an alarm monitoring 
display, for enhanced safety. 
Vessel power comes courtesy of either two Volvo 
Penta D16 MG diesel generators, generating 
477kWe apiece, or a 400kWh battery bank 
produced by EcoPower. The hybrid electrical and 
control system was designed, supplied and fitted by 
Techsol Marine, which was acquired by European 
tech solutions provider Imtech Marine in 2011.  
The ferry was developed specifically for operations 
in shallow waters, featuring a strengthened bottom 
for extra protection, particularly when beaching at 
low tide. Sea trials have recorded Peter Fraser’s 
service draught as being 0.85m when carrying 
30tonnes of payload, increasing to 1.1m with 
110tonnes of payload. 
Manoeuvrability has been optimised by four 
Schottel SPJ 57 RD pump-jets, each powered by an 
ABB 220kW electric motor and controlled from the 
pilot’s seat by twin joysticks. 
A question mark may have hung over the 
commercial viability of battery power in the past, 
but vessels such as Peter Fraser prove that it is 
possible to achieve a balance between commercial 
viability and environmental sensitivity.

emand for survey vessels is growing, and not 
solely for deep-sea-going, 100m+ offshore vessels. 
Operators are increasingly seeking versatile solutions 
that can handle a wide range of water depths and 
speeds, maximising their opportunities for vessel day 
hire. One of the smallest survey vessels to date made 
her debut in 2013, when UK coastal survey specialist 
Osiris Projects took delivery of the Blyth Workcats-
designed and –built catamaran, Proteus of Liverpool. 
Designed on a bespoke basis for Osiris’ clients, 
primarily for utilisation by offshore interests in both 
the oil and gas and renewable energy sectors, the 14m 
x 5m Proteus of Liverpool has received UK Maritime 
and Coastguard Agency (MCA) Category 2 approval 
for safe and stable operations at up to 60 miles 
offshore. Unlike many larger survey vessels however, 
the cat’s low draught also enables her to work in 
extreme shallows, such as those encountered during 
precision littoral survey contracts, while her twin 
Cummins QSC 8.3 engines provide the propulsive 
power and manoeuvrability necessary for tight 
handling in confined waters – a particular 
consideration when operating at and around offshore 
wind farm arrays, for example. 
The vessel will also be tasked with performing cable 
and pipeline pre-/post-installation route surveys 
around the coastlines of the UK and Northern Europe. 
The cat’s maximum design speed of 24knots grants her 
the means to get on station and commence survey 
work with minimal delay, thus saving time and, 
potentially, excessive fuel costs. 
A composite hullform, fashioned from GRP, enables 
the boat to balance strength with lightweight 
capabilities, and enables the deployment of the 
relatively compact Cummins engines, which, when 
matched with the vessel’s hull profile, results in 
improved handling and sea-keeping in extreme 
conditions – another inevitable natural obstacle as 
offshore installations and turbine sites head further 
into deeper waters. Additionally, Blyth Workcats 
points out, GRP construction costs are significantly 
lower than those of metal-hulled cats. 
As part of her tailor-made design, Proteus of Liverpool 
has been fitted with a moon pool, to house a retractable 
sonar deployment system, as well as a hydraulic A-frame 
and retractable transducer mounts, and she is capable of 
operating a full spread of survey sensors. The vessel has 
been designed to accommodate two crew members and 
up to 12 passengers / scientists, and features a spacious 
work cabin and a pair of two-man cabins.

R
epresenting a fine example of Anglo-American 
collaboration, the Response Boat Medium-C 
(RBM-C) has been developed jointly by UK 
designer Camarc and Seattle, US-based boatyard 
Kvichak, primarily to engage in counter-terrorism 
efforts on the US West Coast, as well as search and 
rescue and general law enforcement tasks. 
What makes this particular RBM-C delivery 
different is that it has been designed to meet the 
chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and 
explosive (CBRNE) requirements of the Los Angeles 
Sheriff ’s Department, to effect an extra bulwark 
against the threat of a terrorist strike or the 
smuggling of nuclear materials – for instance, 
materials intended to be assembled in the US to 
construct a ‘dirty bomb’. With this in mind, the 
boat features a roof-mounted RS-700 gamma/
neutron radiation detection system, manufactured 
by Radiation Solutions, Inc (RSI). This mobile 
system, which has previously been utilised by 
military land vehicles and helicopters, enables crew 
to accurately measure and locate both natural and 
man-made radioactive elements in as quick a 
manner as possible. The RS-700 contains a built-in 
GPS receiver and an Advanced Digital Spectrometer 
(ADS), which relays measurements of naturally 
occurring and man-made radioactive elements in a 
1,024-channel, high-res and user-friendly format. 
The vessel can accommodate four members of 
crew and five survivors, and features two rescue 
zones on the deck. The crew’s forward cabin 
includes a refrigerator, microwave and table. 
Kvichak and Camarc selected twin Detroit Diesel 
60-series engines to power the boat, as these engine-
types are compliant with the US Environmental 
Protection Agency’s Tier II emissions requirements. 
Rolls-Royce Kamewa waterjets were chosen in 
favour of propellers, to allow for enhanced 
maneouvrability and the ability to reach a top speed 
of 42knots. 
The vessel has a fuel capacity of 2,250litres and 
has heated windows for increased visibility in 
Winter conditions.

eveloped to provide a balance of speed and stability 
Danish Yachts’ 25m x 10.6m offshore wind farm 
crew SWATH Sea Breeze, which was delivered in April 
2013, has been designed to enable the operator to 
switch between ‘catamaran’ and ‘SWATH’ modes, to 
suit mission-specific tasks in deep waters. Additionally, 
Danish Yachts claims that this class – which has since 
been augmented by the deliveries of sister vessels Sea 
Gale, Sea Storm and Sea Hurricane – could easily be 
utilised in search and rescue and oil and gas personnel 
transportation operations. 
One of Sea Breeze’s unique features includes the 
incorporation of an active ballast tank system. Once the 
craft has reached the offshore wind farm array, or target 
destination, the operator can switch from cat mode to 
SWATH mode. This latter mode relies on the ballast 
system, which comprises two ballast tanks positioned fore 
and aft in each hull. Working from the bridge, the pilot 
can remotely control the tanks, via vacuum and 
pressurised air, to enact a semisubmersible effect for 
‘floating platform’-type stability in rough weather 
conditions and high waves. Danish Yachts estimates that 
this configuration is suitable for crew transfers in 
significant wave heights of up to 2.5m.
The builder claims that Sea Breeze is also the first of its 
kind to have had its hull, superstructure, internal 
structure and reinforcements constructed exclusively 
using carbon fibre. 
The composite approach was taken in order to both 
reduce downtime for maintenance work and slash overall 
vessel weight, thus maximising fuel efficiency, especially 
when she is travelling with a full complement of five crew, 
24 passengers plus various items of equipment. 
The vessel also features a high-friction, forward 
fendering arrangement, optimised with a sensor 
pressure monitoring system, for added stability when 
the vessel is touching on at the site. 
The SWATH design has a clear bridge area for 
enhanced operator visibility and the 50m² deck space 
can handle loads of up to 10tonnes, facilitated by a 
hydraulically driven deck crane with an outreach of 
8m. A helicopter drop-off area has also been 
incorporated into the aft deck, to assist with emergency 
personnel transfers.  
In terms of transportation, Sea Breeze has been fitted 
with brackets designed for a single lift point, 
permitting the operator to lift the vessel via a single 
wire, either on land or at sea. Design-wise, the vessel 
can also be stored on any flat surface, with no need for 
additional supports, nor a cradle.

B
uilt in Louisiana, US by Gulf Craft, to an Incat 
Crowther design, SEACOR Lynx may technically 
be the third in SEACOR Marine’s four-strong 
CrewZer series of crew boats – the first two of 
which, the 51m x 11.6m SEACOR Cheetah and 
SEACOR Cougar, were delivered in January 2008 
and April 2009 respectively – but she and her sister 
SEACOR Leopard, which was delivered in late Q3 
2013, certainly differ from their predecessors in 
terms of size, capacity and manoeuvrability. 
Lengthened and widened to more than 58m x 
12m, one of SEACOR Lynx’s more notable 
advancements has been its adoption of a dynamic 
positioning (DP) system, rated to DP3 capability. 
As well as being one of the first, if not the first, crew 
boats to feature DP3 functionality, the inclusion of 
this technology boosts the human safety factor when 
transporting high volumes of personnel to offshore 
platforms, motherships or wind turbine array-based 
floatels located in deep waters. Feedback from 
SEACOR Marine during the first few months of 
operation confirms that the vessel is able to maintain 
its position, within a margin of 0.5m, in full 
deadweight conditions, whilst in a 3m sea and 
facing cross currents of 4knots and a 20knot breeze. 
SEACOR Lynx’s DP arrangement is enabled by the 
presence of four reversing waterjets, supplied by 
Hamilton, working alongside a pair of Thrustmaster 
retractable azimuth thrusters, and overseen by a 
Kongsberg control system. Should the main engine 
or thruster encounter a failure, or any compartment 
suffer a fire-or flood-resultant loss, the operator can 
deploy this system to keep the vessel on station.
The fact that the vessel is able to limit its motions 
is a particularly timely advantage, given the entry 
into force of the ILO Maritime Labour Convention 
in 2013, providing additional comfort for crew 
and passengers alike. In addition, SEACOR Lynx 
offers spacious seating for the full passenger 
complement of 150, members of which can also 
access enhanced luggage space and additional 
toilets, in comparison to the first two CrewZer 
class vessels. A snack bar and coffee-making 
facilities are also provided. The crew, meanwhile, 
are housed within a mix of officer and rating 
cabins located within the hulls, with galley and 
mess facilities concentrated in the port hull.
The upper deck wheelhouse is fitted with 
forward- and aft-facing control stations, and the 
design of this zone has been configured for 
increased visibility. Similar to the previous 
CrewZer deliveries, the cargo decks aboard 
SEACOR Lynx and SEACOR Leopard are lined with 
hardwood inserts and feature heavy duty cargo rails 
at the sides. In addition to external firefighting 
pumps and rescue boat, a landing rig for surfer 
class vessels can be fitted amidships at the 
operator’s discretion, and each vessel has the ability 
to carry 150tonnes of deck cargo.

eveloped to provide a solution for offshore crew 
transfer in a variety of sea and weather conditions, the 
24m aluminium catamaran Sea Fox, designed and built by 
France-based Navalu, highlights that builders on the 
European continent are catching up with UK yards, who, 
until recently, have dominated the market in offshore wind 
farm and oil and gas platform support vessel production. 
Sea Fox was delivered to Enviro-serve, a UK-based provider 
of wind farm crew transfer vessels, guard boats and 
workboats, in October. The vessel has been kitted out with a 
2tonne A-frame and a Guerra deck crane, the latter capable 
of lifting 2.4tonnes at 2.5m, or 0.86tonnes at 6.6m. The 
provision of the A-crane enables dive missions and/or the 
launch of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for subsea 
work – with the vessel’s 12-passenger capacity and four 
cabins enabling technicians to stay onboard for periods of 
time.  Sea Fox also boasts a fully fitted sick bay, complete with 
a casualty bed and treatment area. 
A special provision has also been made for the transfer of 
equipment and large components; the vessel’s deck area has 
been strengthened to handle 15tonnes, and features space for 
a pair of 20ft containers or three 10ft containers. A hydraulic 
capstan is also fitted on Sea Fox’s fore deck. 
Sea Fox incorporates four independent lines of propulsion 
and two bow thrusters, meaning that the vessel should be 
able to maintain operations at a speed of 20knots even in the 
event of a single mechanical failure. This type of resilience 
and consistency is becoming paramount for offshore support 
vessel operators, whose energy clients have come to demand 
constant vessel availability and projects to be turned around 
within increasingly tight timeframes. Sea Fox is equipped 
with four Doosan engines, four TwinDisc gearboxes and four 
Rolla-manufactured, five-bladed fixed pitch propellers. 
As Enviro-serve points out: “One of the biggest factors of 
lost time on wind farms is downtime due to poor weather.” 
With this in mind, Sea Fox has been designed with optimised 
sea-keeping abilities. The wave-piercing bow has a finer than 
typical entry, so that when the vessel pushes onto a wind 
turbine monopole or offshore construction vessel, any waves 
roll past the bow, rather than lifting it, thus eliminating the 
effects of excessive vessel motion on the ladder. Instead, the 
vessel pivots on the bow while the stern lifts to compensate, 
resulting in more static operations, saving time and reducing 
the likelihood of seasickness and/or fatigue for onboard 
technicians – as well as yielding obvious safety benefits when 
passengers are climbing onto the terminals in rough weather 
and deep waters.

A
ustralia-headquartered builder Strategic Marine has 
put its Vietnamese yard to good use, using the facilities 
to land its first contract with Oman’s National Ferries 
Company, the latter of which has been eager to boost 
domestic sea transport capacity within the Sultanate. 
As Reece Newbold, group business development 
manager at Strategic, put it in November 2013: “Although 
the aluminium ferry market has been depressed for a while, 
it remains a focus sector for us…we have strong pedigree in 
building these and similar types of vessels in our regional 
yards.” Specialising in aluminium construction, Strategic is 
also noted for its range of offshore wind farm support 
vessels and high-speed patrol craft. 
Constructed to a Sea Transport Solutions design, the 
45.8m x 16m ro-pax catamaran Shanna was the first of 
two ferries delivered to the Oman-based operator in 
2013, swiftly followed by its sister, Jawharat Masirah. 
Each vessel has the capability to carry up to 294 
passengers, 154 situated internally, and, vehicle-wise, up 
to 38 cars, or four trucks and 24 cars. The ferries are 
operating on a route between Shanna, on the mainland, 
and the island of Masirah. 
Shanna is equipped with four CAT C18 Acert main 
engines, delivering 357kW at 1,800rpm, subsequently 
granting a top speed of 18knots, or 15knots when 
operating at maximum load, and a range of more 
than 500nm.

T
he current trend for modern navies is to bypass the 
old formula of large, cost-intensive warships, and 
to instead concentrate on acquiring smaller, high-
speed craft, capable of fast emergency response, and 
able to swarm coastlines and trouble hotspots as 
rapidly as possible. Added to the fact that, in many 
developing countries, it can often prove far easier to 
find personnel qualified to handle small patrol craft 
than larger, more complex vessels, this trend looks set 
to continue, especially in South America and Asia, 
both of which regions have been adopting lightweight, 
small craft military and coastal surveillance strategies 
at an expanding rate, over the past three to five years.  
One such tender, placed by the Indian Navy (IN), 
has led to the development of the SM16 fast 
interceptor craft, designed by Thailand’s Albatross 
Marine Design (AMD) and built at the Solar Marine 
Lanka yard in Colombo, Sri Lanka. This latter factor 
was significant in itself, involving Solar Marine Lanka 
adopting lightweight composite infusion techniques 
for the first time, in a break from its usual production 
schedule of heavy fishing boats. The hull structure has 
been fashioned from DIAB Divinycell foam, featuring 
H130 foam on the bottom and H80 and H60 foams 
for the remaining areas. 
Designed to be fully functional at sea state 3 and 
seaworthy up to sea state 4, sea trials conducted in late 
2012 showed the vessel capable of operating in sea 
state 5, which AMD claims “exceeded expectations”. 
The SM16 has been constructed with a safe working 
deck, featuring a walk-around design. To minimise the 
potentially harmful effect of accelerations on the crew, 
the deckhouse has been situated close to the centre of 
gravity, and this area features a steering console, 
co-pilot console, four seats and two sofas. The craft 
features a watertight double bottom and is subdivided 
by four watertight bulkheads, to minimise the risk of 
sinking in the event of severe bottom damage. 
The SM16’s storage area, meanwhile, has been 
confined to a compartment adjoined to the collision 
bulkhead, enabling a clearer layout for personnel 
flow, the dedication of areas for specific functions 
and easy access to the deckhouse when carrying 
injured parties in stretchers. 
In order to select an adequate propulsion system, 
AMD undertook at least four different resistance 
prediction methods, generating resistance curves for 
the SM16 using Wolfson chine craft and high-speed 
craft methods, as well as Savitsky and Lubomirov 
methods for range of operational displacements. 
The end result, as demonstrated during late 2012 
sea trials, was a pair of Caterpillar C-18 engines 
driving Castoldi TD400HC waterjets. AMD adds 
that a total of 16 different configurations of trim 
tabs, interceptors and drive settings were tested in 
order to fine hone the finished craft for optimised 
ride control and manoeuvrability.

Z
odiac Milpro’s new Sea Rib Aluminium (SRA) 750 
concept has been designed with flexibility in mind, 
enabling military and police / coast guard customers to 
specify and modify the basic design to suit their mission-
specific purposes. The first vessel in this series, which was 
delivered to the French Navy, has been developed to 
handle the most treacherous of conditions, courtesy of a 
new, robust, marine grade aluminium hull form, 
featuring high sides, and the option for a rugged new 
D-shaped inflatable collar. 
Measuring 7.4m x 2.8m x  1.7m when fully inflated, 
the SRA 750 can be fitted with D-shaped fendering that 
sees the flat side of the D placed in direct contact with the 
surface of the aluminium hull. As a result, this 
arrangement can provide greater protective strength and 
stability than can  conventional round tube designs –
although the latter remain an SRA 750 option for 
operators who would prefer this solution.  
Additionally, the D-shaped collar provides more space 
on deck – granting a floorboard area of 8.48m² - and can 
be removed swiftly for maintenance work. Dimensions 
for the hull alone come to 6.5m x 2.2m x 1.2m. 
A particularly notable feature of the new class is the 
incorporation of integrated deck tracks, thus enabling 
crew to alter the boat’s layout for mission-specific tasks. 
For instance, removable seating means that deck space 
can be created to accommodate additional onboard loads, 
or to increase the range of shelter available for passengers 
when the RIB is operating in tempestuous weather. 
Classified by DNV to its High Speed Light Craft rule 
(HSLC R3 Patrol), the SRA 750 can be supplied as two 
types for users; corresponding to European Recreational 
Craft Directive Categories B and C respectively, these 
types can accommodate up to eight and 16 passengers, 
with Category B models featuring a maximum payload of 
2.3tonnes compared to Category C craft’s 3tonnes limit 
– adequate, Zodiac Milpro says, to accommodate the 
mounting of heavy automatic weapons. When the craft is 
fully loaded with fuel and featuring the collar, overall boat 
weight is recorded at 1.08tonnes. 
The SRA 750 comes available with a choice of either 
inboard or twin outboard engines, featuring a single shaft 
length of 635mm and a twin shaft length of 508mm. 
When kitted out with a single engine, the recommended 
maximum power output rating comes to 220kW, while 
twin engines have a cut-off limit of 110kW apiece. 
Weight restrictions limit single engines to 288kg, or two 
231kg units. 
While Zodiac Milpro identifies first responders and civil 
authorities as the SRA 750’s ideal market audience, the 
rugged nature of the craft’s design could make it useful for 
offshore support operations as well, such as wind farm 
support, or dive support operations. To facilitate the latter 
activity, the SRA 750 comes with a diver door, providing 
access through the side of the hull when the D-shaped 
collar is fitted. Should a round collar be fitted on the vessel, 
a rapid access door serves a similar function. 
As with other vessels in the Zodiac Milpro family, the 
SRA 750 features a self-draining deck, two built-in fuel 
tanks (each with 250litres capacity), integrated fuel and 
electrical lines and anchor and storage lockers.

lthough the Interceptor 48 class was originally 
launched 
by 
designer 
Frank 
Kowalski’s 
Safehaven Marine stable in 2010, it was primarily 
intended as a patrol boat. The launch and delivery 
of the 14.5m Sverri in August 2013 signifies the 
vessel’s adaption as a dedicated rescue vessel, and it 
has been put to use by the Faroe Islands Rescue 
Service, providing emergency response capabilities 
in this exposed North Atlantic region, subject to 
high sea states and heavy storms during the Winter 
months. 
Sverri differs from her predecessors in her 
propulsive arrangement; this version of the 
Interceptor 48 is the first to have been equipped 
with Volvo Penta IPS 800 drives. The IPS units 
incorporate Volvo Penta’s dynamic positioning (DP) 
system, thus enabling Sverri to hold position and 
heading whilst stopped and during rescues. 
Combined with the vessel’s Volvo Penta D11 
engines, this set-up has been proven to enable a top 
speed of 30knots, following the conclusion of sea 
trials in a full force 9 storm and 4m seas.  Onboard 
power is provided by a 3.5kW generator. 
The lifeboat’s deck is protected by a full length 
outboard safety rail, specially designed to hinge 
inwards to prevent damage to the railing when 
undertaking boardings. This is augmented with an 
inboard hand rail, incorporating a Hadrian safety 
rail. Man overboard (MOB) recovery operations 
have been made possible courtesy of a swing-out 
A-frame and Jason’s Cradle unit, stored in a recessed 
locker in the superstructure side. Waterline access is 
provided by a dive platform at the transom. 
Sverri has the capacity to carry four crew members 
and eight survivors, while onboard tanks include 
capacities for 2,000litres of fuel and 170litres of 
fresh water. The vessel is also equipped with a pair 
of 12-man RFD liferafts, provided by Survitec. 
Additionally, the boat has been fitted with a 
comprehensive 
navigation 
and 
radio 
communications suite, based on Raymarine’s E 
series 165 displays, featuring HD radar, GPS 
plotter, sonar, autopilot, Rhotheta direction finder, 
Sailor SSB radio and DCS VHF, gyroscopically 
stabilised FLIR thermal camera, CCTV cameras and 
a laptop computer, all controlled at a dedicated 
navigator’s position just aft to starboard of the 
vessel’s central main helm position. 
The rescue boat is self-righting, capable of 
recovering from a 180degs roll over, and has 
accordingly been designed with watertight features. 
Deck, hull and superstructure have been fashioned 
from GRP, for reduced overall weight and 
subsequent fuel savings.

I
t’s good to see the UK boatbuilder spirit for ingenuity 
and diversification is still alive, as CTruk’s first 
venture into military craft construction, namely last 
year’s launch of the prototype Twin Hulled Offshore 
Raider (THOR), demonstrated. 
Better known for its range of offshore wind farm crew 
transfer vessels and SWATHs, CTruk has transplanted 
design aspects garnered from these vessel types to this new 
11m x 3.45m, flexible patrol craft class. For instance, the 
builder’s patented reconfigurable deck formation enables 
rearrangement of the deck space, to free up more space for 
cargo, vital equipment and weaponry, depending on 
mission objectives. 
CTruk claims that THOR is suited to roles including: 
protection of amphibious sea lanes; beach casualty extraction; 
troop deployment; harbour protection; search and rescue 
activities; and even unmanned surface vessel operations, in 
the case of mine countermeasures or extremely dangerous 
missions. Composite materials have been incorporated into 
the THOR class’ overall bodywork, to ensure lightweight 
operations, and the vessel has a fuel capacity of 500litres. 
The debut THOR craft was born of consultations hosted 
within the CTruk Collaborative Amphibious Project (CAP) 
consortium, which brought together a number of sub-
system manufacturers keen to develop an innovative craft for 
the small warship sector. Partners in the CAP consortium 
include CA Clase, FLIR Systems, Rolls-Royce (which 
supplied THOR’s Kamewa FF310 waterjets) and Barrus, 
among others. 
This first-in-class THOR configuration has been 
designated the role of Force Protection Craft (FPC); this 
variant of the series includes Saab’s Trackfire 50Cal 
remote weapons system, controlled from within the craft, 
and would see two primary crew members (such as cox 
and commander) team up with two additional crew 
members (weapon operator and situational awareness 
operator), with the option for a fully suspended shock 
mitigating carousel in the main compartment to house 
troops and equipment. Canopies would also be provided, 
to shield both crew and sensitive equipment from the 
detrimental effects of harsh environments.
However, other THOR variants are set to include Troop 
Carrier mode, for the carriage of two crew members and 12 
troops, which would feature an option for a fully suspended 
carousel in the main compartment, for additional crew 
comfort; and the Riverine configuration, which would see 
onboard space readjusted to cater for two crew members and 
four troops, and with ballistic protection installed onboard to 
shield the coxswain, navigator and weapon operator, as well 
as the vessel’s Yanmar main engines and waterjets. In Riverine 
mode, onboard weapons would include a manually 
operated, 50-calibre weapon affixed to a ring mount and up 
to four general-purpose machine guns, two situated on 
pintle mounts and two on slide and lock pintle mounts. 
According to CTruk, rapid deployment was another 
agreed specification of the CAP consortium, and the THOR 
class has been designed to be launched from various assets, 
including a C17 aircraft or a 28m CTruk 50T multi-purpose 
catamaran, serving as a ‘mother ship’.

T
he green ship revolution is inspiring all manner 
of innovation across the boatbuilding sector, and 
the Damen-designed and built Waterspreeuw (or 
‘Dipper’ to our non-Dutch-speaking readers) is no 
exception. This ‘Damen Patrol Vessel 1304 Hybrid’ 
was tailor-made to the specific requirements of 
owner Waternet, which requested a craft to undertake 
inspections and patrols of Amsterdam’s waterways 
and canals, and especially to enforce regulations 
within these zones. It was also imperative that the 
boat produced minimal emissions, in tandem with 
the capital’s Air Quality Action Plan, and was capable 
of safely passing beneath the city’s many bridges. On 
all of these counts, Waterspreeuw manages to score. 
The hybrid boat is capable of operating entirely in 
electric mode, care of a set of 13 ES Technology-
supplied lithium polymer batteries for the vessel’s 
drive system, generating just over 130kW in total. In 
terms of range, when driving the boat’s Hydrosta 
four-bladed fixed rudder propeller, this electric 
configuration grants the vessel a range of at least six 
hours whilst operating at a service speed of 5.4knots, 
or up to nine hours, on one electrical charge, when 
operating at approximately 3.8knots. 
Although primarily intended for electric 
operation, should Waterspreeuw’s battery capacity 
begin to dwindle below the minimum level, her 
Steyr engine is ready to automatically kick in, to 
fill the power gap. When both drive systems are 
deployed, the vessel is able to attain its maximum 
speed of 8.6knots – a speed which the boat is able 
to sustain for about an hour or so when using 
batteries alone. 
The vessel’s hull has also been specially designed 
for minimised wash, so as not to disturb the many 
houseboats dotted around Amsterdam’s narrow and 
often busy canals, especially when Waterspreeuw is 
turning in tight spaces. Additional manoeuvrability 
on these waterways is granted by the rudder 
propeller and a Hydrosta 11kW bow thruster, and, 
by kitting out Waterspreeuw with a 3m spud pole, 
Damen has ensured that the hybrid vessel can moor 
in a range of different locations, even when 
conventional mooring facilities may be absent. 
The patrol boat is also equipped with a Steyr/
AMK diesel generator set, compliant with the 
European CCR3 standard for exhaust gas emissions, 
set by the Central Commission for the Navigation 
of the Rhine. Waterspreeuw has also been issued a 
Zone 3 certificate by The Netherlands’  Human 
Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT).

high-tech onboard solutions, all within a more 
compact format than its previous two 7,500dwt 
cement carrier models, which were delivered in 
1981 and 2003. 
The yard, which is perhaps better known for its 
range of container and cargo ship newbuilds, has 
equipped this smaller, 97m loa vessel with a hybrid 
cargo handling and control system, manufactured by 
Supero Seiki, which comprises three main segments:  
a 1,000tonnes/hr mechanical loading system; a 
600tonnes/hr mechanical discharging system; and a 
400tonnes/hr pneumatic discharging system. 
For enhanced manoeuvrability in narrow port 
spaces and stretches of water, Kyokuyo has also 
fitted the vessel with a bow thruster, a schilling 
rudder and a slipping clutch system, while energy-
saving fins have been applied to the build, to 
optimise propulsion efficiency. 
The carrier’s air compressor, which is utilised for 
cargo discharging operations, and shaft generator 
are both driven from power taken off from the 
front-end of the main Akasaka A38SR engine, 
which delivers a hefty 2,206kW output. Yutaka 
Maru No.8 has also been fitted with a gearbox 
featuring an omega clutch, this latter factor 
intended to enable the operator to run both the 
main generators and shaft generator simultaneously, 
regardless of the engine’s current revolution state. 
A streamlined approach to bridge electronics has 
seen a one-man bridge-type console, with ECDIS 
and GPS facilities, and a 23” monitor radar, fitted 
on the bridge, this package coming courtesy of 
Furuno. At the owner’s request, the carrier has also 
been kitted out with multiple cameras and monitors, 
enabling remote monitoring of various onboard 
spaces. According to Kyokuyo, all equipment was 
selected to comply with the unmanned standard 
(M0), so as to reduce the crew’s workload, as well as 
to bolster safer navigation.
Onboard capacities include 3,698m³ for bulk, 
1,152m³ for ballast water, 122m³ for heavy oil and 
26m³ for diesel oil. The vessel has been designed to 
accommodate eight officers and three crew 
members, all housed in cabins per man. The ship’s 
ballast control system was supplied by Amco 
Engineering Corporation.

esigned specifically for Turkish shipbuilder Sanmar, 
and representing the yard’s 100th tug delivery, Robert 
Allan Limited’s (RAL’s) first RAmparts 2400SX series 
vessel, Zeycan Y (formerly Boğaçay I), was delivered to 
Turkish owner Gemport in mid-Summer 2013, followed 
by a sister vessel, Boğaçay II, which joined Sanmar’s fleet in 
September last year. Sanmar has dubbed the RAmparts 
2400SX class the Boğaçay class (literally translating as ‘bull 
steam’), and is marketing the vessels as part of its new breed 
of tug solutions. 
The RAmparts 2400SX class builds on RAL’s previous 
RAmparts 2500W tug concept, with the hull remaining 
essentially the same as its predecessor, having been designed 
with good dead rise for improved thruster performance, 
modest side flare, a half-raised forecastle deck for good sea-
keeping and RAL’s trademark conically shaped double chine 
stern, to ensure that the tug can run astern at high speeds 
whilst retaining good stability and control. 
The remainder of the RAmparts 2400SX tug has been 
customised to suit Sanmar’s unique requirements for 
flexibility when it comes to available options and production 
efficiency. Sanmar raised a number of specifications for the 
RAL design team; one being the ability to install three 
different Z-drive sizes, in order to achieve 50tonne, 60tonne 
and 70tonne bollard pull (bp) versions of the tug, whilst 
maintaining the same shaft line and same diameter drive 
well. Additionally, Sanmar wanted the capability to fit both 
Caterpillar-manufactured CAT 3512C and 3516C engines 
on the same engine bed, to accommodate the differing 
power levels required to attain the aforementioned variations 
in bp. Other considerations requested by Sanmar included: 
the ability to fit a double drum winch, a split drum winch or 
a single drum winch on the same deck foundation; an option 
for firefighting systems capable of meeting FiFi 1 class 
notation, whether fitted with CP thrusters or half-driven by 
an independent auxiliary engine; an optional aft winch; and 
an the ability to fit both a single aperture staple and a double 
aperture staple on the same seating, to suit the three winch 
options.
For the first two vessels in this class, Sanmar selected a FiFi 
pumpset half-driven off the front of the port main engine, 
and delivering 1,200m³/hr seawater to one 1,200m³/hr 
water/foam remotely operated monitor. 
Tank capacities at 98% include: 87.3m³ for fuel oil; 
10.6m³ for potable water; 41.8m³ for water ballast; 1.6m³ 
for oily water; and 3m³ for sewage. Zeycan Y has been 
outfitted to accommodate six members of crew, with two 
double-berth cabins situated on the lower deck, and two 
officer cabins on the main deck. Ship-handling fenders at the 
bow comprise an upper row of 800mm-diameter cylindrical 
fenders and a lower course of W-fenders. 
In sea trials, Zeycan Y and Boğaçay II have achieved a bp of 
60tonnes ahead, matched with a free running speed of 
12knots. Plans are now underway to tinker with the 
RAmparts 2400SX design to ensure a bp of 75tonnes on 
future models.
