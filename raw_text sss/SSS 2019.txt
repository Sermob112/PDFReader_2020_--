D
esigned and built to fish for crab and trawl 
for demersal fish, Atlantic Titan features 
the ability to completely close the main deck 
area midships, allowing it to convert to a full 
factory processing deck for modern fish 
processing and onboard freezing.
For crab fishing, the vessel is equipped with a 
hydraulic hauler which is monitored from an 
offset helm position at the starboard side of the 
wheelhouse. The catch is released for sorting 
and then fed into two large 50,000litre-capacity 
refrigerated salt water (RSW) tanks.
Trawling for demersal fish is conducted from 
the trawl deck, located on shelter deck level 
behind the forecastle accommodation and 
wheelhouse. Trawl-related work is monitored 
from a designated position at the aft end of the 
wheelhouse, with full-height windows enabling 
the skipper to keep a constant eye on all  
fishing gear.
The Bopp-supplied trawl winches and net 
drums allow for single-net trawling with the 
catch being taken aboard aft, up a stern ramp 
and through a hydraulic cod end hatch into a 
portable hopper on the processing deck.  This 
deck can be completely closed during trawl 
operations, with deck pumps keeping the space 
dry. Once processed and frozen, the catch is 
stored in the 160m3 freezer hold.  The two RSW 
tanks can also be reconfigured, via the removal 
of large portable panels, to give an enlarged 
hold space with a total hold capacity of  
over 260m3.
The vessel is fitted with a Yanmar 6EY 17W 
main engine, rated 749kW at 1,350rpm and 
coupled to a Reintjes WAF 563 reversing 
gearbox.  This drives a 2,000mm-diameter 
nozzled, fixed pitch propeller supplied by Kort 
Propulsion. The hullform, along with a high-
lift rudder designed by Macduff Ship Design 
and a bow thruster supplied by Kort Propulsion, 
also grants Atlantic Titan a high degree of 
manoeuvrability. The vessel is also fitted with 
bilge keels for roll reduction.
The main fish hold, positioned forward, has 
the ability to either refrigerate or fully freeze 
catch, depending on the type of fish targeted 
and the duration of the voyage.  Aft of the main 
hold and roughly amidships are two large 
50tonne RSW holds – these hold crab but can 
also be fully opened, using hinged portable 
panels, to augment the fish hold capacity.  The 
entire refrigeration system was designed and 
supplied by Paumier Marine. 
Below the fish hold are two fresh water tanks 
supplying a total of 23,000litres of water for 
domestic systems.  The vessel also has four main 
fuel tanks and two service tanks, offering a total 
fuel capacity of 65,000litres, for extensive range.

B
remen is an example of Baltic Workboats’ 
Patrol 24 WP class, a 24m patrol vessel 
designed and built for German Customs needs. 
The boat’s predominant tasks include patrol 
work and at-sea inspections.
As a new model in the builder’s wave-piercing 
series, the Patrol 24 WP was developed to 
exhibit outstanding performance capabilities in 
any weather. The wave-piercing technology 
provides a longer waterline length when 
compared to a traditional hull vessel. In rough 
sea conditions, when the bow becomes 
submerged, the top surface of the bow creates 
increased downforce, which compensates for 
the buoyancy of the bow – the wave-piercing 
bow cuts through the waves and reduces 
vertical accelerations. 
The bow design reduces pitching motions and 
provides a smoother ride for the captain and crew at 
all speeds. This is useful, given that the ships (three 
in total, including Gelting and Darss) commenced 
their operations in the most demanding conditions 
the Baltic and North Seas could throw at them.
When compared to a traditional hull, a wave-
piercing hull design is estimated to provide 
40% less vertical acceleration, accompanied by 
an improvement in fuel economy of up to 30%, 
Baltic Workboats says. 
The wheelhouse offers nearly 360° visibility, 
for enhanced safety both inside the cabin and 
for the crew on deck. The captain has a centre 
position with uninterrupted views of the deck 
and boarding areas. 
All three vessels comply with Lloyd’s Register 
rules. Despite the powerful machinery installed 
on board, the boats were designed and 
assembled to enable them to produce extremely 
low levels of vibration, noise and emissions.

H
ybrid vessels aren’t just limited to the 
coastal ferry and short-sea trades; as 
Chasewell demonstrates, this greener, leaner 
technology can be applied to patrol and pilot 
boats too, helping port and river authorities, 
navies and police agencies to meet increasingly 
strict clean air standards. This can be especially 
beneficial for boats that spend a lot of time 
loitering and idling. 
Designed by Andy Page of Chartwell, the first 
entry in the Chasewell class is described as a 
flexible hybrid-electric patrol-cum-pilot boat, 
with future units in the range set to span 9-18m 
in length. As the group couldn’t achieve the 
desired level of efficiency with a conventional 
hull form, which would have required more 
batteries or bigger engines, the hull was 
developed with a deep-V forward and an  
aft featuring reduced surface area for as  
little transom immersion as possible, for 
minimal drag. 
Chartwell also focused on shaving weight off 
the vessel wherever possible, right down to the 
selection of onboard toilets, Page adds. “There’s 
not much existing data out there on how low-
speed resistance affects craft in the sub-15m 
range – or even in the sub-24m range, for that 
matter,” he told Ship & Boat International in 
late 2018, highlighting the innovative nature of 
the task in hand. 
The Chasewell is equipped with two electric 
motors – one per flywheel on the engine – fed 
by a 20kWh battery arrangement. The vessel’s 
electric power is replenished by overnight 
charging, typically using a portside power 
connection. Page estimates that the 20kWh 
battery pack would require 10 hours’ worth of 
charging to operate at 6-8knots for an 
uninterrupted period of two to three hours. In 
diesel mode, these engines would also help to 
top up the batteries. 
The Chasewell class has been developed to be 
fairly customisable, with a number of interior 
options to suit end user requirements. It was also 
deemed important to ensure that all equipment 
can be easily removed from the vessel, particularly 
the battery pack, and this consideration required 
development of an alternative to conventional 
engine room access hatches. 
As another benefit to boatbuilders, Page says, 
the Chasewell class can be manufactured and 
supplied as a CNC-cut structural kit.

S
eptember 2019 saw the launch of the debut 
unit in Dockstavarvet’s new Combat Boat 90 
(CB 90) HSM class, the first in an 18-strong 
order for the Swedish Marine Corps. 
This new class builds on the previous and 
iconic CB 90 H, which first hit the waves in 1989 
and has proven a backbone of the Swedish 
Marine Corps since the early 1990s, with 145 
units being constructed for this naval force. 
Additionally, the naval architect and builder 
estimates that it has supplied 80 units to overseas 
customers, with clients based in Greece, Norway, 
Malaysia and Mexico, not including CB 90 H 
models built overseas under licence.
The new CB 90 HSM model was developed 
partly to improve the Swedish Marine Corps, 
capabilities and to modernise the CB90 platform 
with enhanced capabilities. It was decided to 
bolster the Swedish Marine Corps in terms of 
numbers and capabilities, and this strategy 
prompted two decisions from the Swedish 
Amphibious Corps. The first was to put several 
existing CB 90 H craft through a lifetime extension 
programme, including a complete overhaul of 
their hulls, waterjets, engines, electronics and 
onboard systems. The second was the development 
of the CB 90 HSM.
The HSM designation translates from Swedish as 
“half platoon, protected, modernised”. This type 
retains the CB 90 H hull’s 20° deadrise  and 
reinforcements for “forceful landing”, but now 
combines the latest versions of the Scania V8 
engine and the Rolls‑Royce mixed-flow waterjet, 
which, Dockstavarvet says, results in increased 
power and propulsive efficiency. The CB 90 HSM 
is fitted with: Level 2 armour protection; a Saab 
Trackfire remote-controlled weapon station; and 
bespoke navigation and communication suites. 
Crew comfort and noise reduction were also 
prioritised for this new class.

F
ebruary 2019 saw shipbuilder Japan Marine 
United (JMU) complete a new GustoMSC-
designed jack-up, CP-8001, intended to boost 
Japan’s ambitions in growing its domestic offshore 
wind energy sector.  
With 30,000km of coastline at its disposal, 
Japan would appear to be an ideal territory for 
offshore wind farm development. Indeed, 
according to some analysts, the country could 
reap a potential 1,600GW of offshore wind farm 
power in total.  In November 2018, the country’s 
government passed a bill permitting wind farms 
to operate in Japanese waters for up to 30 years 
and energy majors such as Tokyo Electric Power 
Company and E.ON have not been slow in sizing 
up this Asian market. This progress ties in well 
with the Japanese Government’s stated aim of 
decarbonising its economy by 2050.
Hailed as the first and largest DP2-rated jack-up 
built in Japan for offshore wind-related projects, 
the self-propelled CP-8001, which incorporates 
GustoMSC’s four-legged GJ-3750C design, was 
tailored specifically for the requirements of its 
operator, Tokyo-based civil construction company 
Penta-Ocean Construction. The vessel’s 
construction was supervised by Japanese class 
society ClassNK and is reportedly the largest 
dynamic positioning (DP)-enhanced jack-up 
registered by ClassNK to date. 
The unit has been designed to install large-scale 
wind farm structures – for instance, 10MW-rated 
turbines – in water depths of up to 30m, with leg 
lengths of 66.7m. However, deeper waters are 
possible: CP-8001 can handle installations in 
depths of up to 50m, with leg lengths of 86m. 
GustoMSC adds: “The four legs and diagonal 
preloading capability allow for easy, fast and 
secure jacking and preloading operations, 
without tug assistance. From the start, especially 
severe earthquakes on the coast of Japan were 
significant for the design of the unit.” 
Following a round of sea trials and jacking trials 
in Japanese waters shortly after its completion, 
the rig was shown to be capable of a top speed of 
10.3knots. 
The vessel’s onboard living quarters provide 
room for up to 120 persons. The GJ-3750C class 
also incorporates a helideck into its design, to 
facilitate crew changes and for emergency response. 
The rig certifies Class NK DPS-B, a DP2-rated 
system supported by four thrusters, to enable 
optimal station-keeping even in rough weather 
conditions. According to Jan-Mark Meeuwisse, 
GustoMSC commercial director: “CP-8001’s 
unique features allow highly efficient operations 
in Japanese ocean side areas with harsh wave and 
weather conditions, while not giving in on the 
welfare of the crew. The proven technology makes 
it most suitable for various installation works 
from a safe and stable self-elevating platform.”

from Northern Lights, R.W. Fernstrum copper-
nickel Gridcoolers, and aluminium doors and 
windows built by AJR Marine Windows in Port 
Coquitlam. Two Wintech 25H-9-12 manual 
winches are placed on the forward deck of the 
vessel, to provide a solid connection between the 
tug and the barges. 
The steel hull is divided into two symmetrical 
watertight components joined by bolting 
flanges running down a centreline, non-
watertight void of the vessel that enable it to be 
disassembled into two transportable pieces. 
The aluminium deckhouse contains a settee/
galley, head and two cabins for three crew 
members. The head is outfitted with a sink and 
an electric incinerating toilet, which removed 
the requirement for a black water system. The 
deckhouse, meanwhile, is bolted to the deck on 
raised isolation pedestals and can be readily 
lifted off. The aluminium wheelhouse is 
positioned on the deckhouse to give the 
operator an unobstructed view of the forward 
tug deck and a high line of sight, unimpeded by 
the barges’ cargo during operations. The 
wheelhouse detaches as a separate module for 
transport; in total, the vessel comprises six 
truckable modules (two hull modules, a 
deckhouse module, a wheelhouse module and 
two exhaust modules). All hull and 
superstructure modules are fitted with lifting 
lugs to accommodate loading and unloading of 
the vessel modules for transportation to a 
desired work site. 
The vessel is designed to be fully assembled at 
a remote site on two flatbed trailers with limited 
resources and cranage in less then 36 hours. 
Once assembled, the vessel can be launched 
directly off the flatbed trailers with the use of a 
rudimentary boat launch.

F
unded by the EU Horizon 2020 project, the 
‘E-ferry’ Ellen constitutes the prototype of a 
next-generation, pure-electric passenger and 
vehicle ferry. In operation since August 2019, 
transporting passengers between the island  
of Ærø, in the south of Denmark, and mainland 
Denmark, calling at the ports of Søby  
and Fynshav. 
As with most standard car/passenger ferries of 
her type in the area, Ellen can carry 31 cars or 
five trucks, and between 146-199 passengers. 
Her most significant feature, however, is the fact 
that she is fully electric and can cover a range of 
22nm between charges. To accomplish this feat, 
Ellen was designed to be extremely energy-
efficient; at a speed of around 13knots, she uses 
around 1,700kWh to cover this 22nm route, 
naval architect Jens Kristensen explains. 
To accommodate a battery capacity of 4.3MWh, 
weighing in at around 60tonnes, weight-saving 
measures were implemented wherever possible, 
in terms of design and with respect to the various 
components and systems themselves. The two 
main engines, for instance, are electrical 
permanent magnet motors with an output of 700-
750kW apiece, each weighing 950kg. Similarly, 
the charging system, which delivers up to 4.4MW 
of power, is DC-based, with heavy transformers 
converting the shore AC power to DC on land, 
rather than aboard the ship. 
Everything aboard Ellen is electric, including 
the lifting arrangements for the bow visor and 
winches, as well as the generation of emergency 
power. The E-ferry incorporates a fully redundant 
power management system, with the ship 
virtually split into two independent sides. This 
consists of two independent battery rooms, each 
supplying one main engine. 
On shore, the charging system is also a first of 
its kind. Charging is conducted using a large 
male plug, connecting four independent charging 
lines to the ship’s female plug, each line supplying 
the ship with 1MW. The charging arm is placed 
on the vessel’s ramp, to accommodate changes in 
conditions caused by loading/offloading or tides.

T
he title of ‘Japan’s first all-battery-powered 
vessel’ may have been snapped up by 
e-Oshima, a double-ended ro-pax ferry completed 
by Oshima Shipbuilding in Nagasaki – a builder 
that typically specialises in the construction of 
bulk carriers and steel marine/offshore structures. 
The 35m × 10m ferry has the capacity for 50 
passengers and eight passenger cars, or four 
passenger cars and a bus. She has a depth of 3.8m, 
draws approximately 2m and will be used 
primarily to transport visitors to and from 
Oshima’s yard and the opposite shore.  
e-Oshima has been fitted with a 590.5kWh 
lithium-ion battery pack, supplied by Japanese 
manufacturer GS Yuasa Corporation. As well 
as fuelling the ferry’s propulsion, this battery 
energy will basically power everything on 
board, including all wireless, navcoms, 
lighting and HVAC systems. 
GS Yuasa would appear to have good 
pedigree in this regard: the company’s battery 
applications have previously been incorporated 
aboard deep-seagoing submarines, the Boeing 
787 Dreamliner and even the International 
Space Station. The batteries deployed aboard 
the ferry are drawn from the company’s 
LIM50EN-12 range, which are specially 
formulated for high-energy industrial systems, 
and comprise 3,360 battery cells in total. 
The manufacturer adds: “e-Oshima can be 
charged in around 2.5 hours, and the battery 
system includes management equipment that 
provides multiple layers of redundant protection 
for the batteries.” This arrangement grants the 
ferry a top speed of 10knots. 
Oshima also worked with MHI Marine 
Engineering to develop the ferry’s automatic 
navigation system, which can grant her crew a 
break while keeping ‘human-free’ tabs on 
course-keeping and speed control. The system 
is also designed to ‘watch out’ for collisions 
and groundings. 
The main propulsion system includes two sets 
of azimuth thrusters driven by electric motors 
adopted for propulsion, berthing and unberthing. 
Electric power is enough for several crossings 
and all power demands of the ferry.

I
t’s rare we feature chemical tankers in 
Significant Small Ships, but at a relatively 
modest 65m in length, Etsuzan Maru No. 8 
makes it in by virtue of being the first vessel to 
adapt a new design patented as a suitable 
structure for tankers carrying heavy liquids 
with high specific gravity. 
The ship was planned as a substitute  for 
Etsuzan Maru No. 7, the intention being to 
build a more robust ship  capable of handling 
stormy weather in the Sea of Japan. Initially, it 
was determined that, in order to meet the 
stability standard, larger tonnage than 
conventional chemical tankers, or smaller 
loads, would be required. Hongawara Ship Yard 
therefore attempted to mitigate ‘swaying’ of the 
liquid cargo by reducing the free surface of the 
liquid, since it found the larger free surface of 
the liquid with high specific gravity resulted in 
worse stability.
With a conventional rectangular tank shape, 
even when 95% liquid cargo was loaded, the 
area of the free surface remained large and the 
centre of gravity rose. However, a sloped 
topside tank installed above the cargo tank in 
the cross-section of the proposed tanker type 
suppressed the rise of gravity of the liquid 
cargo, and free surface area was minimised 
when 95% cargo was loaded, for greatly 
improved stability. By doing this, the chemical 
tanker met the stability standard without 
changing the principal dimensions, tonnage, 
loading capacity, etc. In addition, Hongawara 
Ship Yard also expects reduced damage to the 
tank’s inner wall due to suppression of the 
liquid’s swaying motions.
The operability and safety of the mooring 
ship have also been improved by the variable 
pitch-type bow thruster device and rudder, 
which enable parallel departure and arrival. 
Propulsion efficiency was improved by 
adopting Nakashima Propeller Co’s energy-
saving promotion system, NIPS. 
Furthermore, the amount of power 
consumption inside the ship was reduced by 
adopting LED lights for all lighting in 
residential areas, aisles and engine rooms. 
Onboard LAN and WiFi, meanwhile, grant the 
crew easy access to the internet.

E
-TWO was built to the specs of Damen’s ASD 
Tug 2811, the next-generation version of the 
company’s ASD Tug 2810 design. Based on that 
format, the ASD Tug 2811 features enhanced 
power and manoeuvrability, suiting it to high-
power applications, such as assisting with the 
berthing and unberthing of large vessels in major 
ports and/or restricted waterways. 
The ASD Tug 2811 has also been brought up to 
the latest standards: for instance, E-TWO is laid 
out to comply with the new stability regulations, 
initiated as Harmonised Class rules and enforced 
by IMO for adaptation in January 2020. These 
ensure that the potentially opposing trends of 
increased power and compactness in modern 
ship-handling tugs are reconciled to ensure 
maximum safety in operations. This tug class also 
incorporates a modular marine NOx reduction 
system and the Damen Digital Platform, the latter 
of which is designed to share operational data in 
real time with shore support, enabling fleet 
managers to anticipate and deal with everyday 
challenges in planning and maintenance. Damen 
explains: “This has direct benefits in increasing 
the effectiveness of the vessels through delivering 
peak efficiency and minimal downtime.”
E-TWO was delivered to EMAR Offshore 
Services of the Netherlands in March 2019, and 
comes fitted with an additional firefighting system, 
aft winch and hydraulic crane. These features are 
expected to assist EMAR in extending its presence 
in Africa, by enabling the vessel to take on a wide 
variety of roles. Her first project saw her head for 
China, where she towed a new 75m × 25m flat-top 
barge to the Middle East, for use on marine 
construction projects.

A
lbatross Marine Design’s (AMD’s) F180EC1 
design was produced by Sakun C. 
Innovation, a Thai company perhaps better 
known for its work in the automotive industry, 
and was primarily designed to function as a 
river shuttle on Bangkok’s famous Chao Phraya 
River, taking in a journey between the northern 
Phra Pinklao pier in the historic Khao San 
district all the way down to the southern 
transport hub of Sathorn Pier.
Quick construction turnaround times were the 
goal here; as AMD explains: “Due to special 
extrusions and pressed panels designed for this 
project, the boat can be built in short times, 
taking less than one month to construct the 
hull.” The rise of robotics as a time-saving 
welding methodology has also played a key role 
in reducing turnaround times. 
As AMD recounts: “One challenging task for 
the design of this boat was related to 
transportation – the boats should be 
transportable by road, including transport under 
pedestrian bridges, as the production facility is 
‘off water’.” As a result, vessel length, breadth and 
height had to be limited. One crucial limitation 
was related to vessel air draight, requiring a 
clearance of 4.5m to guarantee safe passage 
under bridges.
The engine rooms are located in the demihulls, 
accessible via flush hatches from the passenger 
saloon and the aft deck. Installation hatches bolted 
to the deck have been provided to facilitate engine 
maintenance and/or removal. The demihulls are 
of semi-planing catamaran type, with canoe sterns 
and platforms, optimised for a cruising speed of 
10-15knots with a relatively high payload.
The pilothouse was bolted on top of the roof, 
and all railings and benches on the upper deck 
were designed to be easily removable. From a 
design point of view, AMD also used its 
extensive experience in catamaran design and 
followed international safety standards such as 
the IMO HSC Code. “Water transport safety is 
not well established in Thailand, but these boats 
are probably the safest passenger transport on 
the river,” AMD says. Special attention was also 
paid to ensuring that the vessels in this series are 
safeguarded against passenger overloading, 
which has become a standard feature for AMD 
newbuilds created for Asian operations.

019 saw Turkey launch what has been billed  
as the world’s first all-electric tug, reliant 
solely on battery power for bollard pull.
The Navtek-designed Zero Emissions Electric 
Tug (ZeeTug) deploys a fully electric, battery-
powered propulsion system, and is designed for 
operations in tight spaces and restricted waters. 
The completed ZeeTug will mainly operate 
inside the Port of Istanbul, under the operation 
of GİSAŞ Shipbuilding Industry Co, which 
provides port services within this zone. The 
newbuild will also be able to conduct emissions-
free tasks in the Marmara Sea. GİSAŞ intends to 
replace four of its existing tugs with eco-friendly, 
all-electric alternatives as part of a wider 
commitment to reducing emissions in Tuzla’s 
shipbuilding/ports zone. 
As well as slashing emissions, Navtek estimates 
that oscillations at low loads can be eliminated by 
up to 50%. 
As part of the ZeeTug’s R&D, power requirement 
data for 21 different manoeuvring options was 
collected from real tugs, and net power 
measurements were made on the shaft. Corvus 
Energy supplied the vessel with two battery packs 
and a Corvus Orca energy storage system (ESS), 
the latter featuring a total energy storage capacity 
of 1,484kWh. This feeds two 968kWe Siemens 
propulsion motors turning fixed-pitch propellers. 
ABB provided the DC/DC inverter/converters 
and drive system. 
For back-up, the ZeeTug relies on a 100kW 
genset, providing sufficient power for the tug to 
return to shore in the event of an electrical system 
failure, or should the vessel need to undertake 
firefighting operations. The batteries can typically 
be recharged overnight: one charging per day, via a 
shore-side connection or the specially developed 
Quick Charge Station (QCS), will meet the tug’s 
operational needs. “The ZeeTug’s batteries can be 
fully charged in an hour and 15 minutes through 
the QCS, but can also be charged through the 
shore connection and/or genset, though this will 
take longer,” says Navtek.
The ZeeTug isn’t just good for the environment: 
it could also benefit the bottom line. Navtek 
claims that an electric tugboat incurs just 15% of 
the operating cost associated with a diesel tug of 
this size. Consequently, GİSAŞ hopes to anticipate 
savings of US$350,000 per tug if it goes ahead 
with its plans to replace the diesel-powered 
models in its fleet.

erjólfur is a passenger-car ferry featuring a 
hybrid propulsion system, delivered in 
June 2019 to Vegagerðin – also known as the 
Icelandic Road Transport Authority. The vessel 
is tasked with handling demanding courses 
between the islands of the Westman archipelago 
in Iceland, 9km from the coast of southern 
Iceland – specifically, serving the route 
between Landeyjahöfn and Vestmannaeyjar. 
The travel time on this route will be only 20 
minutes, a sail made possible by the ferry’s high 
levels of manoeuvrability and its efficient drive 
system, says CRIST. “[Its] modern design… 
allows it to operate in very difficult marine 
conditions – the southern waters of Iceland are 
dominated by long ocean waves and short local 
waves caused by the wind,” the builder and 
designer continues. “In winter, weather 
conditions include low temperatures and heavy 
rains; however, they do not pose a challenge  
for the ferry.”
Herjólfur has been designed for operation by a 
crew of 10, and can accommodate up to 390 
passengers in winter and up to 540 passengers 
during summer sailings, this difference being 
accredited to passenger access to the vessel’s main 
outside terrace. Onboard facilities include a 
cafeteria, a children’s play area, a galley and 
provision rooms. An open deck with benches and 
tables is arranged on decks 4 and 5. 
The ferry has been arranged with one main engine 
room, a single electric drive room, a single pump 
room and a separate main thruster room. The engine 
arrangement comprises a trio of non-reversible, 
4-stroke single-acting turbocharged inter-cooled 
high-speed MTU models. The vessel’s cargo spaces 
were arranged in the port side, while the ro-ro cargo 
area has been divided vertically, into two sections; 
the first, a portside fixed deck for trucks, buses and 
cars; and two decks (one fixed, one a hoistable 
mezzanine deck) for cars, located starboard.

ncat Crowther’s new Shadow Cat series of 
customisable twin-hulled, aluminium yachts 
would appear to be an ideal fit for owners with an 
abundance of tenders and toys. Featuring a 
hullform largely inspired by those of Incat’s 
previous Seacor CrewZer and Fast Crew Boat 
(FCB) lines,  this new class has been developed to 
offer “incredible amounts of deck and storage 
space”,  the designer states. 
While her interior spaces are intended to offer 
the levels of comfort you’d expect from a private 
yacht, there’s a utilitarian streak to this class, 
whose design appears to be a hybrid of the 
recreational and commercial – and perhaps 
reminiscent of some of the larger OSVs, albeit 
swapping turbine- and platform-related cargoes 
for tenders, daughter craft and mini-land vehicles.
The catamaran hullform was selected for two 
key reasons: the first being its ability to offer a 
high degree of “inherent stability”, thus reducing 
the need to purchase and fit additional gyro or 
roll stabilisers. Secondly, the designer says, the 
catamaran platform can lead to fuel savings in 
the region of 40%, effectively enabling the vessel 
to operate at her full range with 160,000litres of 
diesel fuel. 
The first-in-class HODOR offers roughly 325m2 
of space on the main deck and 250m2 of space on 
the upper deck. Her deck area can accommodate 
five tenders of varying lengths, ranging from 7m 
to 17m, as well as jet skis and quad bikes, a 
dedicated submarine garage, a helipad 
(strengthened to handle 6tonnes) and crew 
support equipment. However, for future 
Shadow  Cats, each vessel’s deck layout can be 
tailored to the owner’s requirements. 
The tenders and submarine can be launched 
from the upper and main decks. To support 
these launches, the upper deck features two 
knuckle boom cranes, while the main deck has 
a pair of beam cranes. A lifting platform is 
incorporated into the aft, enabling the launch 
of a 17m chase boat, while a portable davit on 
the fore deck can be used for additional jet ski 
storage, or to launch the vessel’s ROV. Two 
stern platforms provide an additional means of 
water access. 
HODOR’s interior features include a hospital/
treatment zone and dedicated spaces for fresh and 
frozen food storage. The vessel is also equipped 
with a  twin anchoring system, specified with the 
aim of further reducing motions when she is at 
anchor. Vessel pitching motions are reduced by 
twin Humphree active interceptors on the stern. 
The cat is powered by two MTU engines fitted 
with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) 
technology, making them compliant with IMO 
Tier III and EPA Tier 4 emission requirements.

n May 2017, MOL decided to order an LNG-
fuelled tugboat that would be operated by 
Nihon Tug-Boat Co. Built by Kanagawa 
Dockyard, the vessel incorporates dual-fuel 
Yanmar engines and runs on LNG supplied by 
Osaka Gas. Named Ishin, the vessel is Japan’s 
first tugboat built to conform to the International 
Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other 
Low-flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code). 
The tugboat’s role is to support large-size vessels 
in port and escort ships in Osaka Bay and the 
Setonaikai Inland Sea. So Ishin not only had to 
deliver optimum performance in port, but also 
high-speed operation for those escort duties. The 
vessel has a top speed of 16knots, a notably high 
speed for typical tugs in this class. “Generally, 
ship manoeuvrability and high-speed sailing tend 
to contradict each other, but this ship reconciles 
both needs,” comments MOL. 
Ishin is also equipped with not one but two 
azimuth thrusters, each of which is driven 
directly by an engine. The vessel can be freely 
moved forward and backward, port and 
starboard, by changing the engine rpm and the 
direction of the 360° rotating propellers. By 
making full use of this feature, it was expected 
that Ishin could more effectively assist large-
size vessels in berthing/unberthing. 
Her LNG fuel tank is positioned on the rear 
deck and is a removable structure. Normally, the 
tank is not removed, but it can be: for example, 
when Ishin is docked for regular maintenance. 
To achieve this configuration, the LNG fuel-gas 
supply system is integrated with the tank to 
create a very compact structure. As a result, the 
risk of a liquid spill is significantly reduced 
because the design minimises the area where 
onboard leaks might occur during operation. 
Additionally, the piping from the intake port to 
the tank has been shortened, to minimise the 
effect of heat load on the piping when bunkering 
the vessel from an external source. 
The LNG fuel tank has a vacuum-insulated, 
double-hull structure, which MOL likens to a 
“large thermos bottle”. It can maintain the 
temperature inside the tank longer than general 
ocean-going LNG carriers because the heat 
load is small and pressure can be contained 
inside the tank.
Ishin has adopted dual-fuel engines, which 
can be operated in both ‘Gas Mode’ (running 
on LNG) and ‘Diesel Mode’ (running on heavy 
fuel oil A). The LNG is gasified using exhaust 
heat from the engine, and supplied to the 
engine. The gas is mixed with air and ignited 
with an extremely small amount of heavy fuel 
oil A to create the combustion that produces 
power in the cylinders.

B
illed as a versatile “bring-to-work” and high-
speed cargo-carrying solution, MO5 is a 
semi-small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) 
crew transfer vessel developed to bring more 
flexibility to the offshore wind farm sector. 
One of its notable features is its ability to 
conduct transfers in conditions with wave heights 
exceeding 2m Hs. The vessel is also capable of 
carrying a payload of 70tonnes, partly thanks to a 
spacious aft deck, and can be used to undertake 
survey or ROV operations, thus widening her 
operational window. 
In addition to the above, MO5 can conduct dive 
support operations, courtesy of a four-point 
anchoring system and a full dive suite. According to 
her operator, Mainprize Offshore: “The combination 
of unsurpassed seagoing, together with the ability to 
operate impressively in wave heights of over 2m, 
means that the vessel is also ideally suited to fast 
ferry, survey, pilotage and search and rescue duties.”
The 25.4m × 11m vessel was developed by Bob 
Mainprize, managing director of Mainprize 
Offshore, in conjunction with James Walker of 
Southampton, UK-based Walker Marine Design. 
The two had previously collaborated on the 
designs of Mainprize Offshore’s former deliveries, 
MO3 and MO4 (see Significant Small Ships of 
2017). MO5 was ordered on speculation and 
constructed in a 12-month timeframe, following 
a period of extensive tank testing, and at a cost of 
more than £3.5 million (US$4.6 million).

ora B comprises what’s been described as an 
“advanced version” of Neptune Marine’s 
shallow-draught EuroTug 3515 design, specially 
customised for Basque-based offshore service 
provider Zumaia Offshore and intended for a 
wide range of offshore and nearshore duties. 
The vessel was designed with close input from 
Zumaia Offshore, to ensure that she could meet 
the needs of the current market. 
One of Nora B’s key features is her spacious aft 
deck, spanning some 250m2 in total. This area is 
sheathed in wood and can be utilised as a 
platform for ROV and diving support operations, 
as well as geotechnical surveys, cable-laying and 
recovery operations and mass flow excavation, 
for example. The deck is equipped with anchor-
handling, towing and tugger winches, plus pins 
and shark-jaws, and also features a built-in open 
stern with roller. 
On the deck, one also finds features such as a 
moon pool and a heavy-duty knuckle boom 
crane with integrated winch and hydraulically 
abatable A-frame. The vessel also deploys a DP 
system and a four-point mooring system as 
back-up, should her work take her a significant 
distance offshore. 
As has become increasingly common with 
craft of this size, Nora B makes use of a diesel-
electric hybrid propulsion system, consisting of 
twin 192kW electric drives operating in 
conjunction with a pair of 970kW diesels. This 
set-up should permit minimal fuel consumption 
when the vessel is in DP mode, or provide  
extra kick and increased bollard pull when in 
towing mode. 
Neptune Marine explains: “A user-configurable 
power management system offers different work 
modes – such as diesel, hybrid or full-electric – 
in DP1 or DP2 to match client requirements 
with the weather and sea state, at an optimum 
combination of performance and fuel 
consumption…as an added bonus, the e-drives 
can also work as shaft generators for the  
ship’s systems when it is free sailing, or  
while mobilising.”

T
he 15.8m loa PILOT-1 is the first entry in a 
series of pilot boat designs produced by 
UK-based Camarc Ltd to provide fast and 
efficient running at transit speeds, combined 
with excellent seakeeping. As priorities, 
attention was continually paid to weight 
control and detailed design, resulting in a 
robust and sea-kindly craft fit for the 
demanding role of a pilot boat. 
In view of the operational requirements, weight 
refinement was not taken to the minimum limits 
allowed by classification rules, but was carefully 
considered to combine robust construction with 
efficient operation. The vessel is designed to be 
user-friendly and easy to maintain, and has a life 
cycle of around 18 to 20 years. 
The double-chine hull was developed to grant 
the crew enhanced all-round seakeeping. The 
vessel is class-approved with a steel hull and 
deck and an aluminium superstructure. 
Propulsion is provided by two high-speed, 
electrically controlled diesel main engines, 
coupled to suitable reverse/reduction gear 
boxes. These turn a pair of fixed-pitch 
propellers, each with five blades, via stainless 
steel shafts, to provide a speed in the region of 
20-22knots. 
This particular pilot boat was built by Sanmar 
for Mersin International Port (MIP) in 
southern Turkey, and delivered in March 2019. 
As an additional concession to crew welfare, 
Sanmar arranged for the vessel to feature a high 
standard of interior finish, with special 
attention paid to noise and vibration reduction.

ntegrated to deal with various emergency 
scenarios, Red Dolphin was jointly developed by 
UK-headquartered 
naval 
architect 
BMT 
Specialised Ship Design (formally BMT Nigel Gee) 
and Singaporean boatbuilder and aluminium 
specialist Penguin Shipyard International. 
This 35m marine rescue vessel (MRV) concept 
offers what BMT describes as “an advanced, 
external firefighting capability that goes above and 
beyond standard FiFi Class 1 requirements”, 
enabling her crew to not only tackle blazes at sea 
but also rescue a significant number of casualties 
from the water and respond to major incidents in 
potentially contaminated areas.
For instance, the MRV’s firefighting system is 
designed to be fully redundant with three monitors 
and three pumps independently connected with a 
total flow rate of 4,800m3/hr. This latter feature 
means that the MRV could also assist larger-scale 
landside firefighting operations. 
The vessel also has the capability to throw foam 
with a total stored capacity of 6,000litres. The ship 
is built upon an aluminium structure with 
comprehensive self-spray protection capabilities.
Another unique feature of the MRV design is a 
superstructure designed as a citadel to protect 
those within from the potential dangers of a 
chemical, biological and/or radiological (CBR) 
release in the outside environment. The CBR 
system is provided with 100% redundancy on 
filtration and air-conditioning equipment.
In addition to the CBR system, Red Dolphin is 
fitted with a decontamination room, with a 
fully automatic decontamination system and 
two airlocks providing access to the citadel. 
The citadel area can accommodate the vessel’s 
four-man crew, plus up to eight firefighters and 
30 survivors. 
Although Red Dolphin possesses such large 
integrated systems for her operations, she can 
achieve speeds of up to 31knots. This high-
speed capability allows the vessel to enter 
disaster areas faster than many craft fit with the 
same (or less) equipment on board. 
Other key points of interest include a 5.4m 
high-speed rescue boat onboard, supplied by 
Palfinger and with man riding launching, plus 
significant storage capacity for firefighting 
equipment and a first aid room.

A
t the time of Red Kestrel’s launch, conducted 
in April 2019, Tony Graham, Cammell 
Laird chief operating officer, commented: 
“Shipbuilding is back in a serious way on the 
Mersey…it is tremendous to see more 
shipowners and ferry operators choosing to 
build in the UK.” Spearheading this optimism, 
Red Kestrel is a dedicated ro-ro freight ferry for 
Isle of Wight (IoW) operator Red Funnel, tasked 
with providing a link between East Cowes on 
the IoW and Southampton on the UK mainland 
– a trip with a typical crossing time of an hour, 
or just under. 
Red Kestrel has a length of 74.3m and 265 lane 
metres of ro-ro freight capacity – the latter capable 
of accommodating up to 12 HGVs, Red Funnel 
says. As a freight vessel, she is restricted to 12 
passengers and will operate with a crew of six or 
seven. She is powered by dual IMO Tier III-
compliant Cummins QSK38 diesel engines, 
feeding a pair of Rolls-Royce US 155FP azimuth 
thrusters, and can achieve a speed of 12.5knots at 
85% MCR. When travelling at this speed, the vessel 
enjoys a range of just over 970nm. Cummins also 
supplied Red Kestrel’s twin 6B-CP gensets, rated 
80kW apiece. 
Onboard capacities include 38.6tonnes of fuel 
and 9tonnes of water. Cammell Laird estimates 
that the £10 million (US$13.1 million) vessel 
generated 3,000 man-hours of work for its 
in-house team of apprentices and created work 
for about 410 people, including apprentices and 
subcontractors.

M
ay 2019 saw the Italian company deliver the 
tug C.871 РИМ-MОСКВА (Rome-Moscow) 
to the Russian Federation Navy. The tug is set to 
dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines 
in the Barents Sea as part of the Aspect Konversia 
Project. The €8 million vessel was commissioned 
in 2016 by the Italian Ministry of Economic 
Development (MISE) as part of a collaboration 
between the Italian and Russian governments, 
related to the safe disposal of radioactive waste. 
For the Adria-based shipyard, Rome-Moscow 
represents the second delivery of an ASD 
(azimuth stern drive) tug – the first being 
Cap de Fer, which was delivered to the Harbour 
Authority in Skikda, in Algeria (see Significant 
Small Ships of 2018). Rome-Moscow has been 
designed and built to work at temperatures of 
-10°C, and to ensure heating within the crew 
accommodation areas in temperatures as low as 
-34°C, while moored in harbour over winter.
The tug has been built and checked in 
accordance with the regulations of the Russian 
Maritime Register of Shipping (RS). It also meets 
regulations for onboard living and bathroom 
conditions for boats flying the Russian Federation 
flag, and has been classified ICE2.
The tug has a bollard pull capacity of 65tonnes 
and a dynamic pull of 54tonnes, and can reach a 
speed of 12.5knots care of the fast diesel engines 
linked to twin azimuth drives with variable-
pitch propellers. The tug is designed to 
undertake technical services such as towing, 
pushing and escorting in ports or open sea, as 
well as guiding third parties during docking 
manoeuvres and assisting with vessel recovery 
in the event of failure. 
The shape of the hull was designed for optimal 
flow of water to the propellers, for enhanced speed, 
towing stability and course-keeping, Vittoria adds. 
“With its compact structure, which includes two 
orders of superstructures and a single deck, this 
tugboat is designed to perform at its best the most 
complex technical and recovery operations, even 
in extreme weather conditions,” the builder states.

S
abah is a 42m × 12m fisheries surveillance 
patrol vessel intended to provide support to 
the Marine Surveillance Department of Kuwait. 
Her main duties include patrolling the local sea 
to spot illegal fishery activity, giving support to 
other small patrol boats and carrying out search 
and rescue missions. 
The boat is capable of sailing at speeds in 
excess of 30knots, courtesy of a pair of 2,880kW 
engines and fixed-pitch propellers. Seakeeping 
capabilities are expected to be enhanced via the 
adoption of a double-chine hull design. She will 
accommodate 16 crew members and a 7m RIB, 
the latter located aft. 
The RIB was manufactured by Narwhal Boats 
and is able to accommodate four persons and to 
reach a speed of approximately 30knots. It is 
equipped with a 220hp (164kW) Volvo inboard 
diesel engine and MJP Ultrajet propulsion, and its 
200litre-capacity, under-deck fuel tank allows for 
a wide navigation range, depending upon sea 
conditions. The RIB’s deep-V hull allows smooth 
sailing and enhanced manoeuvrability, whilst its 
reinforced structure offers endurance and 
durability. Its non-slip deck is made of fibreglass-
reinforced marine plywood.
Sabah’s hull has been built in light high-tensile 
steel, and the superstructure module is 
constructed in extruded aluminum panels joined 
together by stir friction welding. This particular 
configuration provides very low weight and 
allows for unrestricted navigation while sailing at 
up to 30knots at 100% MCR. 
The patrol vessel is fitted with a gyrostabiliser 
which operates at any speed, including active  
roll dumping at zero speed when the vessel is  
at anchor.

eaCat Ships launched the 29m high-speed ferry 
Sea Express II at Ocean Marina Yacht Club in 
Pattaya and delivered the vessel to its owner/
operator, Aquatic Rentals, in January 2019.
The sleek aluminium catamaran achieved 
over 30knots during sea trials, and will operate 
in and around the US and British-flagged 
islands in the Caribbean. It is reportedly the 
first ferry of its type built in Thailand for US 
operations. “The islands the ferry is servicing 
were severely hit by Hurricane Irma in 2017, 
and with the rebuilding of the island comes the 
rebuilding and reinvention of the tourist 
industry…this vessel will allow its patrons fast 
and cost effective ferry service between the 
islands,” SeaCat Ships explains. 
Built in accordance with Lloyd’s Register SSC 
Code for hull and also USCG Subchapter K 
requirements, she is suitable for 149 passengers 
internationally and up to 300 passengers for 
domestic coastal services. Twin 1,230kW 
Baudouin V12 engines enable the vessel to 
achieve speeds in excess of 30knots. The newly 
developed deep-V hull includes a double bottom 
to meet IMO High-Speed Craft (HSC) raking 
damage criteria.
Sea Express II’s engine and exhaust systems 
have been produced to comply with IMO Tier 3 
standard and US EPA 4. The exhaust is fitted 
with an SCR system to ensure exhaust emissions 
are as low as possible. This is reportedly the first 
vessel fitted with this exhaust scrubber system for 
these particular engines. Propulsion is via 
conventional prop/shaft, fixed-pitch propellers 
and mini keels, which protect the props. 
The lower deck has 195 economy-style seats 
from Seaborn, plus sunken lounge seating in the 
foredeck area. The upper deck has 36 leather VIP 
business-class seats inside and 58 all-weather 
seats outside. The main cabin also includes a 
small servery. The cabins are fully air-conditioned 
with built in redundancy, to ensure operation 
even if there is a unit failure. Sea Express II has 
four toilets, three of which are on the lower deck 
(including one larger, wheelchair-accessible 
toilet) and one located on the upper deck.
The helm features 360° vision for the captain 
and three additional control stations for docking 
purposes (port, starboard and aft). The main 
control station features the latest touchscreen 
electronic navigation systems as well as 
monitoring and control systems, CCTV, music/
TV, WiFi and intercom systems. The navigation 
system used on board is primarily based around a 
Simrad NSO system and incorporates the new 
Halo radar with Velocity Track Doppler radar 
software, which changes the colour of 
approaching and diverging radar targets.

T
he Claasen-built, 23m chase boat Stargazer 
was developed to serve as a tender for a 
superyacht, and represents the 27th newbuild 
project on which Claasen and Hoek Design 
have jointly collaborated. Hoek Design handled 
all of the vessel’s naval architecture, structural 
engineering and exterior/interior design. 
As well as providing a means of getting the yacht’s 
owner and guests from shore to the yacht in a 
comfortable manner, Stargazer was designed to 
fulfil several other roles. She can be utilised as a 
diving platform, capable of entering small lagoons 
and shallow waters, for instance: a large swim 
platform built into the stern forms steps that plunge 
underwater when deployed, enabling guests to enter 
and exit the water in a straightforward manner. The 
tender can also be used to accommodate extra 
stores, and/or extra crew members or guests, 
complementing the yacht’s three cabins. 
Claasen recalls: “The owner wanted the boat 
to have a Pacific range, meaning she is able to 
be powered by engines underway for 900 miles 
at cruising speed.” As such, Stargazer 
incorporates two Scania engines driving fixed 
propellers for a cruising speed of 16knots and a 
top speed of 24knots.
The lightweight aluminium hull was built in the 
Netherlands and all technical installations and joinery 
work were executed by Claasen and its sister company 
Vitters. According to Claasen: “This was the first time 
we built a new yacht together with Vitters.”

ailed as one of the world’s “most modern 
research vessels” at the time of her delivery, 
SVEA was designed to generate as little radiated 
noise as possible, for the benefit of marine wildlife 
and fauna and for the comfort of her onboard 
complement. This has been achieved via a low-
noise propeller, double elastically mounted prime 
electrical movers and gensets, and floating floors. 
The vessel was also designed to produce 
“minimal bubble formation”, thanks partly to the 
specially designed shape of her bow. This is 
intended to make the vessel ideal for research 
assignments involving exploratory fishing and 
hydroacoustic surveys. SVEA comes fully equipped 
for fishing, bottom sampling and oceanographic 
studies, and can carry, deploy and retrieve a broad 
array of specialised scientific equipment: for 
instance, the vessel has sampling equipment for 
plankton, fish egg/larvae and sediments, plus a 
hydroacoustic current meter (ADCP) that 
continuously measures the speed and direction of 
the ocean currents, from the surface to the bottom. 
The ship has been fitted with customised labs for 
fish-handling, water analysis and data management, 
and an advanced weather station. There are also 
provisions for ROVs and removable containers. 
For environmental sustainability, SVEA is 
powered by hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVOs) 
and comes fitted with particulate filters to prevent 
harmful emissions.

/V Tazlina is one of two Alaska-class ferries, 
alongside Hubbard, operated by Alaska 
Marine Highway System (AMHS). Tazlina 
operates in the waters of Lynn Canal between the 
Alaskan cities of Juneau, Haines and Skagway, 
providing daily ferry service to these communities. 
The vessels were designed by Elliott Bay Design 
Group of Seattle, Washington and built by Vigor 
Shipyard in Ketchikan, Alaska.
The Alaska class is intended to be a prototype for 
the next generation of ferries for AMHS, ultimately 
replacing its aging fleet. Tazlina features twin side 
casings with walk-on passenger access and drive-
through vehicle loading and unloading. Vessel 
propulsion is a twin-screw arrangement powered 
by two EMD 12-710 engines, enabling the vessels 
to have a service speed of 16knots at 85% of MCR. 
The vessel is equipped with controllable-pitch 
propellers and bow thrusters for enhanced 
manoeuvrability through the pristine Southeast 
Alaskan waterways. 
The vessel has the capacity for 300 passengers and 
53 standard vehicles. Onboard amenities include an 
observation lounge, covered and heated solarium, 
cafeteria-style restaurant, children's play area and a 
quiet room.  The vessel derives her name from the 
Tazlina Glacier located 43 miles north of Valdez. 
The vessel design for the Alaska Class Ferries had 
to overcome the challenges of Alaska’s heavy seas, 
high winds and freezing spray. Testing was 
performed on the hullform in a wave tank at Force 
Technology Denmark, enabling the designer to 
optimise performance in heavy seas and improve 
passenger comfort. Advanced computer analysis 
was also performed at the design stage to optimise 
hull shape and efficiency.

A
s the first IMO Tier III exhaust standard-
compliant tug in Canada, Tsimshian Warrior 
has captured attention in terms of both 
performance and environmental stewardship. 
The Robert Allan-designed, Turkey-built tug was 
designed to primarily serve AltaGas’ new Ridley 
Island Propane Export Terminal in Prince 
Rupert, BC, Canada, with capabilities carefully 
identified and verified by multiple real-time full 
mission bridge simulations in collaboration with 
British Columbia Coast Pilots, Pacific Maritime 
Institute, Towing Solutions Inc, Lantec Marine 
Inc and SST Canada.  
Tsimshian Warrior is fully capable of safely 
escorting project gas carriers in ocean conditions, 
assisting them into and out of the terminal berth, 
as well as firefighting and rescue towing. 
Additionally, the tug has several unique features 
that were integrated into the design to elevate 
safety when operating alongside the terminal and 
project gas carriers, most notably: a fixed gas 
detection and alarm system; explosion-proof 
deck machinery; remotely operable ventilation 
louvres; and automatic shut-down functionality 
for non-essential equipment. 
The active bow escort winch was specifically 
tailored to meet the requirements of escorting 
in seas outside of the harbour and out to the 
pilot station. These powering requirements 
were analysed and established via simulation 
tools to ensure that the winch has adequate 
power and haul-in/pay-out speeds for the tug 
to maintain its maximum escort forces of up to 
120tonnes at 10knots, even in dynamic seas.  
Robert Allan Ltd explains: “This active haul-in/
pay-out capability dampens snatch loads and 
normalises towline tension, thus reducing the 
potential for towline breakage as the tug 
responds to waves.”
Crew members have been given comfortable 
single cabins, all with ensuite wet units, and 
Uzmar’s mission included reducing noise 
across the vessel, especially in the 
accommodation area.

esigned to meet the challenges of handling 
and escorting large merchant ships in the Port 
of Luleå, the 36m tug Vilja was developed by 
Vancouver-based Robert Allan Ltd (RAL) and is 
distinguished by its combination of diesel main 
engines, shaft motor/generators and battery bank. 
Using diesel engines alone, Vilja’s ahead 
bollard pull (bp) capacity is 85tonnes, but this 
can be boosted to nearly 100tonnes by engaging 
electrical boost power. This has won the vessel 
the plaudit of being the most powerful 
icebreaking escort tug to incorporate hybrid 
propulsion to date. 
The vessel runs on two 8-cylinder Wärtsilä L26-
series diesel engines, each driving a Kongsberg 
(formerly Rolls-Royce) US355 controllable-pitch, 
azimuthing thruster, capable of absorbing 
3,100kW of power. Twin 1,000kW, in-line shaft 
generators-cum-electric motors  and batteries 
provide extra boost.  The configuration means 
the tug can run on batteries alone, or utilise a 
single main engine in hybrid diesel-electric 
mode, or use both engines in diesel-mechanical 
drive with the option of boost power. 
The ‘green mode’ capability draws solely on the 
batteries for power, and results in zero emissions 
and reduced noise. The system’s characteristics 
also feature a ‘smokeless’ phase, where no smoke 
is produced during start-up of the main engines. 
Vilja has been accredited with Lloyd’s Register’s 
1A Super ice class notation, and can break 
1m-thick ice while maintaining a speed of 3knots. 
A 300kW Brunvoll rim-driven tunnel thruster 
is installed in the forward part of the skeg for 
enhanced manoeuvrability, while Navis supplied 
the vessel’s dynamic positioning (DP) control 
system. An Ibercisa forward escort winch and 
conventional winch on the aft deck, fitted with 
tow pins and roller aft, are used for towing.

ittoriosa, the first RAstar 3000-W class 
LNG terminal escort tug, was delivered to 
Tug Malta, a subsidiary of the Rimorchiatori 
Riuniti Group, Italy. The vessel, which was 
constructed by Turkey’s Med Marine Shipyards, 
has since been deployed at the Delimara LNG 
terminal in Malta. 
The RAstar-series tugs are designed with 
sponsoned hullforms, for enhanced escort 
towing and seakeeping performance. Roll 
motions and accelerations are reportedly less 
than half those of comparably sized ‘standard’ 
tug hulls, says RAL. 
The RAstar 3000-W design for Tug Malta 
boasts numerous other features for LNG 
terminal support. For instance, the bow 
fendering system is designed for a low contact 
pressure requirement of 20tonnes per m². A gas 
detection system has been fitted to warn the 
crew of potential hazardous atmospheres, and 
the vessel features ventilation dampers that can 
be remotely closed. All essential electrical 
equipment on deck is certified for use in a 
Zone  2 LNG environment, while all non-
essential electrical equipment can be 
electrically isolated. FiFi 1 capability with 
water spray is also provided, along with a large 
firefighting foam capacity. 
The RAstar 3000-W was designed with a  
low profile for operation under the flare of 
assisted ships. The wheelhouse provides 360° 
visibility from the operator’s position and 
unhindered lines of sight to the fore and aft 
working decks. 
These decks can be fitted with various 
machinery options. Tug Malta elected to use a 
Rolls-Royce double drum winch with dual 
aperture escort staple on the fore deck, and a 
towing hook on the aft deck, with a future 
option for an aft towing winch. The bow winch 
is driven by two high-pressure hydraulic PTO 
pump units off the front of the main engines. 
First-layer pull on low speed is 102tonnes at 
9m/min, and high-speed pull is 12tonnes  
at 57m/min. Rendering is 145tonnes at 14m/
min (low speed) and 24tonnes at 51m/min 
(high speed). 
Vittoriosa’s accommodations are outfitted to 
MLC-compliant standards, with private en 
suite washrooms, for up to eight persons. The 
master and chief engineer cabins are located on 
the main deck, with three double crew cabins 
located in the lower accommodations.
On trials, Vittoriosa demonstrated nearly 
equal ahead and astern performance: bollard 
pulls of 81.5tonnes ahead and 81tonnes astern 
were recorded, as were free running speeds of 
13.8knots ahead and 13.7knots astern.

long with her sister, Zanzibar 1 should fulfil 
some speedy crossings if her sea trial results 
are anything to go by; according to designer 
CoCo Yachts, her official speed was clocked at 
more than 37knots when travelling with a trial 
load of 45tonnes. The designer partly credits this 
capability to an extensive round of high-
performance computing analysis when designing 
the ferry’s hull, citing the use of NUMECA  
FINE/Marine CFD software. 
The aluminium ferry (known as the Coastal 
Cruiser 448 class) was designed and built for new 
Tanzanian operator Zan Fast Ferries in 
accordance with Bureau Veritas’ classification 
requirements and the terms of IMO High Speed 
Craft Code 2000. Features include “fresh and 
light” interior design, with big side windows 
specified to result in decent outside views. 
Zanzibar 1 is also furnished with West Mekan 
seats with leather upholstery; passengers in gold 
or platinum class can also take advantage of 
reclining seats with built-in USB charge points. 
Additional outdoor seating is arranged on the 
upper aft deck and main deck fore. 
Vessel access is enabled by six electrical winch-
operated ramps: four for passengers and two 
dedicated to luggage trolleys. The ferry has an 
independent luggage space which can fit 12 
luggage trolleys. 
Zanzibar 1 is equipped with an automatic ride 
control system, supplied by Humphree, which 
was specified to keep the trim at the optimum 
point, for reduced fuel consumption. This system 
is also intended to reduce motions in harsh wave 
conditions. CoCo Yachts elaborates: “Trials in 
waves up to 3m confirmed the presence of the 
Humphree system in combination with the hull, 
where accelerations were less than expected [<1g] 
and the speed maintained at 35+knots, sailing 
against the waves.”
Her sister, Zanzibar 2, is scheduled to enter 
service in Q1 2020.
