AFAI08: fast ferry first for China 
With 
a fully laden trial speed of 48.2 
knots. Afiri OS is Lhe first high-speed 
passenger/car ferry to be constructed in 
China and certainly rates amongst the 
fastest Asian-built commercial craft. Built 
at Afiai Southern Shipyard (Panyu), the 
vessel is the first in the K50 Class. 
developed us a joint venture by Australian 
yard [neat Tasmania, Alai Ships of Hong 
Kong and Advanced Multi-Hull Designs 
(AMD), also of Australia. 
Designed to carry 450 passengers and 
S9 ears, the K50 exceeds the quality 
standards established hy international 
classification societies and strong claims 
arc made for its economy. Use of four 
medium speed Ruston I6RK 270 diesel 
engines, of around 5.500kW each, keep 
running costs low and reliability high. Two 
K series vessels operating worldwide, built 
by Encat Australia, have reportedly proven 
extremely reliable since operation started 
in 1995. 
Ajiii 08 has two slender 5m alloy hulls. 
measuring 72.3m on the water!inc. 
supporting an alloy superstructure on anti-
vibration mounts. Each has eight vented, 
watertight sub-divisions comprising lore 
peak, two voids, pump compartment, 
engine room and waterjet space. All 
compartments are divided by transverse 
bulkheads. 
Each hull is fitted with two Kamewa 80 
Sll vvalerjet units. All jets are configured 
for steering and reversing and have ;i 
separate hydraulic system in each hull, 
together with two electric motors driving 
separate pumps. 
The K50 is designed for the stern 
loading of cars on the main deck and has 
space on the aft deck for carrying larger 
heavy loads such as buses or freight. Duty-
free shopping and passenger amenities are 
centrally located on the main deck, with 
the second deck devoted to seating for up 
lo 450 passengers. A liil is installed for 
disabled passengers. 
The wheelhouse. on the tipper deck just 
alt of amidships, is accessed by stairs from 
the passenger area or externally via a rear 
door. Offering 360-degree visibility to 
enhance safety of manoeuvring operations, 
all-round windows have demisters and 
independently operated and controlled 
Wynn straight line and pantograph wipers. 
The ihree forward central windows have 
solar blinds. Forward facing seats are filtei! 
around a centreline navigation console but 
the main helmsman sits at the forward era! 
of the wheelhouse. just off centreline to 
starboard. 
Navigation equipment is extensive and 
includes: Magnuvox MX DGPS. Kelvin 
Hughes radars. Skipper DGSIOI echo 
sounder. Walker speed/distance log and 
wind speed/direction finder, C-P!ath 
autopilot, gyro compass and magnetic 
compass. Onboard communications 
systems for machinery, mooring and 
passenger spaces are controlled from the 
wheel house. 
A comfortable ride is ensured by the 
installation of a Maritime Dynamics active 
ride control system with hydraulically 
operated trim tabs hinged at the after end 
of each hull. Each hull aiso has a special 
abutment to lake optional, forward bolt-
on T-foils and is fitted with an emergency 
trim tab lifting device, which is activated 
in the event of complete hydraulic Failure.

AMBULU: first 
of five for Asia 
AmimVu, the first-of-class FPF 62-
010 from German megayacht builder 
Lursscn Wcrfl. is the first of five such 
ferries ordered by Indonesian operator 
ASDP. 
Constructed in lightweight aluminium, 
shaped for minimal air resistance and 
propelled by four giant waterjets, the 
design owes much to the aircraft industry. 
Similarities also exist internally with 
'class' based passenger categories and 
forward facing seats. 
The ship's lines owe much (o extensive 
and systematic research, model and 
seakeeping tank tests which were carried 
out in the Hamburg ship model basin 
(HSVA). The lines were optimised with 
various test models of different sizes. 
resulting in course stability with excellent 
seakeeping and low resistance. 
The selected hull type is a deep-vee 
monohull with a parallel wedge shaped 
stern and sprayrail. At a Froude number 
of 0.79. the semi-displacement ship can 
maintain its high speed and stability up to 
moderate wave heights and at reduced 
speed, good behaviour is reported owing 
to a Vosper Thoniycrofl active stabiliser 
system. 
To meet the new IMC) Code for High 
Speed Craft. Ambulu has two separate 
engine compartments each serving one 
steerable water jet and one booster jet. 
Power for the Kamewa jets is supplied by 
four MTU type 16V595 TIE 70L diese! 
engines, developing 3805kW at 1,825 rev/ 
mill. 
Improved docking, easy maintenance 
and collision avoidance measures have 
been given special consideration, A bow 
thruster has been incorporated to aid 
manoeuvrability and engine and ventilation 
casings 
arranged 
to 
enable 
unit 
replacement within a 24-hour time span. 
As Ihe FPF's area of operation is 
frequented by fleets of fishing vessels, 
Collision avoidance by means ol a short 
stopping distance has been ensured -
distance from jet reverse to stop is just 
Oilier features include a continuously 
running separator system for efficient 
cleaning of polluted fuels and shaft systems 
of fibre-reinforced plastics. To reduce

2: sister cats on 
standby airport rescue 
After a nine-month build period, two 
catamaran rescue command vessels 
CB I and CB 2 were handed over to the 
Hong Kong Airport Authority in April '98 
by builder. Greenbay Marine of Singapore. 
Each is ready for deployment from special 
rescue berths at either end of (be new Click 
Lap Kok Airport. 
The vessels arc based on an [neat hull 
with major modifications above the 
walcrline made by Vancouver-based naval 
architect, Robert Allan to suit (heir fire-
lighting, 
search and rescue roles. 
Measuring 35.30m x 
12.00m. the 
catamarans have a maximum speed of 28 
knots and are designed to withstand 60-
knot winds and five-metre waves and to 
operate in shallow water. 
The extensive array of rescue and fire-
righting systems aboard each vessel 
necessitated an intensive familiarisation 
programme for crews, each of nine men. 
who will man the craft. Equipment 
includes two RIBs. life raits with a carrying 
capacity of 300 persons, four inflatable 
rescue ramps, hydraulic cranes and lift 
platforms, four Jason's Cradles, specialisl 
detection items such as sonar, thermal 
imaging and underwater cameras and two 
Skum FJM tlre-fighting monitors. Capable 
of discharging 4.000 [itres/min, the 
monitors are mounted on diametrically 
opposite corners of the main deck. 
Floodlights to illuminate the rescue zone 
are carried at the head ofa telescopic mast. 
Power is provided by two MTU I2V 
39d TB74L diesels. each developing 
l,455kW at 2,000 rev/min, driving 
Kamevva 71SII waterjets via ZF BW465 
gearboxes. A pair of l55kW Caterpillar 
3306B driven generator sets supplies the 
electrical power. 
Each boat lias a rescue capacity of 600 
people with onboard accommodation for 
up lo 300 and sufficient inflatable rafts 
to hold 300 more. In excess of 240 
survivors and a minimum of 40 
stretchers can be housed in the cabin on 
main deck and five patients tended in 
the separate hospital all. It is not the 
intention lo station doctors on the vessel 
bul the crews have been trained in first 
aid and. if necessary, the helicopter 
winching platform could be used lo bring 
medical teams aboard. 
At the commissioning ceremony The 
Airport Aulhorily (AA) chairman. Wong 
Pu-yan. commented: "The airport is 
designed and buill to operate to the 
highest standards of safety. With these 
boats we are now much belter equipped 
to conduct rescue and fire-fighting 
operations on the sea surrounding the 
airport island. Our safety, of course, is 
guaranteed also by placing these well-
designed vessels in the capable hands 
of the highly professional crew from the 
Airport Fire Services." 
Raymond Ton, managing director of 
Gree ubay M 
ari ne, w 
h i eh won an 
international tender from the Hong Kong 
Marine Department to build the vessels, 
said modern communications played a 
key role in the shipbuilding project. "In 
view of the lime constraints and crucial 
performance requirements, without 
modern 
information 
and 
communications, success would not have 
been possible. Extensive and precise 
cross-country project management was 
needed to achieve optimal design."

CABLE & WIRELESS 
ADVENTURER: 
trophy-winning trimaran 
Anew 
entrant in die record hooks for 
'98 was the dramatically styled 35m 
\ 14.10m trimaran, Cable & Wireless 
Adventurer. Designed hy UK based naval 
architect 
Nigel 
hens, 
the 
vessel 
circumnavigated the globe in 74 days. 20 
hours and 58 minutes, stealing the record 
from the nuclear submarine USS Triton, 
which finished iis journey on the 84"' day 
back in I960. 
Adventurer's 26.000 mile voyage began 
and ended in Gibraltar and was the first 
attempt to elaim a new trophy funded by 
Cable & Wireless and awarded by the UIM 
(the governing body of power boating) for 
Ihe fastest time around the world. The 
trimaran took a mainly equatorial route, 
with stopovers at Monte Carlo. Port Said. 
Singapore. Hong Kong. Yokohama. San 
Diego, Kingston. Miami and New York. 
Constructed in lightweight wood epo\y 
and FRP composite, the record-breaking 
design has a slender central hull and small 
outer hulls for transverse stability. 
Important aspects of the design included 
displacement/length ratio of the main hulls 
and the position, dimensions and geometry 
of the other hulls. A high level ot' 
redundancy for systems and machinery was 
included lo ensure that the vessel could 
continue in operation in all but the most 
severe systems' failures. 
Power is supplied by twin Cummins 
6CTA8.3M 
diesel 
engines, 
each 
developing 261 kW 
;tt 2,500 rev/min. These 
drive Teiguhiidge 26-inch I'our-bladed 
propellers via Twin Disc MG-5I11SC 
gearboxes for a maximum speed of 22 
knots. Fuel capacity is 15,700 litres, giving 
the vessel a range of 2.3(X)um. To protect 
the stern gear, propellers are positioned 
under the central hull and filled with full 
skegs. Scawaler-eooled charge air coolers. 
manufactured by Serck Heal Transfer, in 
marine-compatible 
materials, 
were 
incorporated lo reduce the temperature of 
the charge air as it enters the engine's 
induction system. This increased the mass 
and density of the 
air, 
improving 
combustion and thereby raising power 
output and reducing emission levels. 
Accommodation for a crew of 16 is 
situated on the main deck with eighl two-
berth cabins, captain's cabin. VIP cabin 
and mess. A central stairway gives access 
to ihe horseshoe shaped low-profile bridge 
and the flybridge. Onboard navigational 
equipment has been supplied largely by 
Raytheon and includes two radars. 
Inmarsat VI and C and gyro compass. A 
McLennan Vislar night vision system is 
also fitted. 
Adventurer, now designated as the first 
in ihe iLan 35 series, was built over a 
ten-month period. June "97-Mareh "98. 
with hull and superstructure ready by 
January '98. Vosper Thornycroft, UK. 
constructed the vessel with structural 
engineering assistance from High 
Modulus (Europe) Ltd. The concept al 
35m is considered ideal for passenger-
earrying in exposed waters. A 25m 
design is being developed Cor patrol 
duties and a 50m version is under 
consideration as a fast cargo carrier.

CATLINK V: trans-Atlantic 
record breaker 
In July 1998 Catlink V, the second of 
two 91 in wave piercing catamarans built 
by [neat Australia, entered the record books 
as the current holder of the Blue Riband 
and Hales Trophy for the fastest trans-
Allantic crossing. 
Catlbtk V broke the two world records 
set just a month earlier by another [neat 
ship Catalonia and clocked an average 
voyage speed of 40.28 knots, marginally 
lower than its proven 43-knot service 
speed. 
Along with sister terry Cat/ink IV, the 
record-holder was ordered by Seandlines 
Cat-Link A/S oi' Denmark to replace three 
fas! femes previously servicing the route 
between Arlms and Kalundhorg. Carrying 
up to 800 passengers and 220 cars, each 
vessel completes the 42nm crossing in 
around 75 minutes and. fo further save 
time, has been fitted with a special loading 
arrangement. 
This 
comprises 
the 
traditional stem access, together witii a 
forward door on the porf side allowing all 
220 cars lo be unloaded in around eight 
minutes. 
Although larger in size, the vessel design 
has evolved from a number of successful 
Incat car ferries, especially those in the 
74m to K6m range. Both Cat-Link vessels 
were built at the Incal shipyard in Mobart. 
Tasmania to the requirements of DNV 
High Speed Light Craft Rules (classed 
+ 1AI HSLC Rl Car Ferry "A" EO) and 
the IMO High Speed Craft Code. 
Attention has been paid not only to 
enhanced loading systems but also to 
extensive fire prevention and extinguishing 
systems, enhanced ride characteristics and 
fuel economy. 
Catlink V is conventionally powered by 
four Ruston 20 RK270 medium speed 
diesels. each developing 7.080k\V 
(9.500hp), driving Lips waterjels through 
Renk reduction gearboxes. A custom 
designed Lipstronic jet control system 
provides, apart from steering and reversing, 
the option of thrust vectoring and autopilot 
control. According to Incal, at full 
displacement with speeds of about 35 
knots, fuel savings of 25 per cent can be 
achieved. 
Two 230k\V Caterpillar generators in 
each hull feed associated independent 
main switchboards, which are capable 
Significant Small Craft of 1998 
13 

of disconnection in an emergency. Built-
in redundancy provides a high level of 
security Tor operation of safely services. 
In the event of the loss of one machinery 
space or switchboard a bus lie can be 
nipped to provide complete isolation of 
the main switchboard or to ensure the 
machinery space on the opposite side is 
unaffected. 
Comfort has been addressed by 
installation of a Maritime Dynamics ride 
control system, now installed on a total of 
24 [ncal car ferries. Comprising an active 
trim tab mounted at the transom of each 
hull lo provide trim and motion 
dampening, it can be used lo adjust the 
gain on pilch, roll ami heave motions 
to optimise vessel performance to suit 
sea conditions, wave direction and 
speed. 
Ride has also been improved by 
increasing the waierlinc Jenglh of the 
fecry by approximately 34 percent over 
the Ineal 74m vessels of the early 
1990s, 
thus 
ensuring 
a 
more 
comfortable ride. 
Advanced 
lightweight 
fire 
protection fittings, developed by 
Colbeck & Gunlon of Tasmania, have 
been used throughout. These include 
single-leafed hinged fire doors, 
single and double sliding tire doors, 
guillotine fire dampers, engine room 
fire dampers, fire hatches and smoke 
baffles. A Thorn Solid State Fire 
Detection system which monitors a 
combination of smoke, break glass 
and heat detectors has also been 
installed. 
Evacuation systems, supplied by 
Liferal't Syslems Australia, cater for 
900 people and comprise four slides 
and a series of lifcrafts. 
Catlink V has one further notable 
feature: an uncluttered wheelhouse. 
Despite central and wing control 
positions to aid docking manoeuvres, 
space is maximised as many electronic 
devices arc separately housed in an air-
conditioned electronics room, which is 
accessed via a private stairwell leading from 
the bridge or vehicle deck.

CHRISTIAN IGROTINUM: 
breaking new ground for export 
Delivery of the 74.5m seiner/trawler 
Christian I Gfdtinum to (he Faroese 
Operator of the same name represented a 
major export coup for Chilean yard Asenav 
as the first vessel it has ever built for a 
European country. 
Ordered to fish for pelagic species in 
the North Sea and North Atlantic, the 
vessel is almost identical to El Cazador 
built by Asenav in September '97 for a 
Chilean company, bin has increased power 
and hold capacity. 
Norwegian designer Vik Sandvik has 
created a round bilge hull form with a U-
lype transom and bulbous bow. The ship 
lias tip profile frames, a double bottom and 
an aluminium wheelhouse. 
With accommodation for 20. the trawler 
has two continuous decks as well as 
forecastle, bridge and boat decks. Noise 
insulated cabins are located aft of 
amidships. 
The engine room, located aft. houses 
a single Caterpillar 3616 series A 
lurbocbarged main engine, developing 
?,420k\V at 1,0(1!) rev/min, This drives 
a i'our-bhided 3,800mm diameter, nickel-
bronze Volda CP propeller through Volda

FAR SENIOR: refined 
and powerful 
All four Ulstein UT 722 vessels bought 
by Norwegian operator Farsiad 
Shipping over the pasl five years have 
progressively benefited from extra 
refinements and modifications, The fifth 
to join the licet. Far Senior, proves to be 
no exception. 
Constructed by Langslen Slip & 
Batbyggeri, the anchor-hand 
I ing lug supply 
vessel has an impressive array of lowing 
and anchor-handling equipment and a 189-
tonne continuous bollard pull. Most 
intriguing amongst its machinery, however, 
is a retractable hydraulic crane, which folds 
into the deck on the starboard side aft. The 
purpose of the crane, which has a 
horizontal pull of six tonnes, is to handle 
the increasingly heavy connections and 
shackles in Ihe Kami Fork area, h is 
probably the first lime a crane of this type 
lias been used aboard an AHTS. Capable 
of full remote control by the deck crew, 
the crane is expected lo offer a greater level 
of safety and ease of working. 
Traditional equipment is less innovative 
but nonetheless formidable. Main anchor-
handling and lowing winches have a 
maximum brake holding capacity of 550 
tonnes, with a line pull of 400 tonnes at 
Mm/miu. The capacity of each winch drum 
is 6,300m of 76mm diameter SWR or 
4,600m of 90mm diameter SWR, The main 
low wire -
1,300m of 83mm SWR 
- can be 
readily removed and stowed on a powered 
reel lo enable the full capacity of both 
winch drums to be used. Two lugger 
winches each have a 20-lonne line pull and 
house 600m of 76mm SWR. 
Four Karm towing pins, with a safe 
working load of 240 tonnes, are installed 
forward of the stem roller, with two Kami 
forks rated at 650 tonnes. 
Far Senior is powered by four Ulsiein 
Bergen diesels producing a total of 
16,800hp. These drive two controllable 
pilch propellers, rotating in fixed nozzles. 
Twn shaft generators of 2.800kVA each are 
coupled lo the main propulsion twin inpul/ 
single output gearboxes and a pair of 
Ulstein high lifi rudders and a l.200hp 
transverse stern thrusler are installed. A 
similar transverse ihrusler is Titled in the 
bow in addition to a retractable fully 
a/.imuthing ihrusler powered by a separate 
[,200bhp engine. 
Whilst the maximum bollard pull is, as 
stated, 189 tonnes, a pull of around 165 
tonnes is achievable with all tbrusiers 
operating at SO per cent capacity. The 
vessel has a maximum speed of 17 knots 
and an economical cruising speed of 12 
knots. 
In addition to Us powerful machinery. 
Far Senior has a deck cargo area of 585m3 
with a maximum load of 900 tonnes, 
internal tanks for liquid storage and a dry 
bulk cargo area of 10.000ft \ High capacity 
discharge systems are provided for all dry 
bulk and liquid cargoes. Four integral chain 
lockers, located amidships, have a total 
capacity of 546m3 of riÂ» mooring chain. 
The wheclhouse features an array of 
navigational 
and 
communications 
equipment including an Anscbutz Pilolslar

IRIS 6.1: fast cat with 
modular benefits 
Now 
operating as a shuttle vessel in 
the Caribbean, Ms 6J is as unusual 
in appearance as il is versatile in concept. 
Built in GRP by the French company Iris 
Catamarans and acquired by TMCA, a 
Caribbean maritime transport company, 
the vessel can carry passengers and/or 
freight in removable, easily dismantled 
modules. 
Measuring 42.77m x 13.5m, the vessel 
has narrow hulls which are linked forward 
by a bulbous 'command head'. The 
passenger compartments, also of GRP 
sandwich construction, are located in-line 
astern and can easily be replaced by 
containers of freight. The modules arc 
mounted on vibration absorbing supports 
behind the futuristic bridge/bow section 
and can accommodate 240 passengers. 
Principal 
criteria 
behind 
the 
development of the new style catamaran 
were seaworthiness, low wake and high 
performance and a variety of configurations 
were tested by ihe builder back in 1995 ai 
the Matin facility in Holland to ascertain 
the optimum solutions. Tank testing was 
carried out in '96 on l/10'h scale models 
and the 
first-of-class 
launched 
in 
November 1997. 
The result has striking lines and a higher 
than average built-in safely factor, 
according to the company. The concept of 
'containerising' the passenger spaces away 
from machinery and fuel storage areas is a 
big safety bonus, further augmented by the 
extensive use of non-combusiible coatings 
and flame-proof partitions, panelling and 
floor coverings. 
Power is provided by a pair of MTU 12V 
400 M70 diesels with an output of 
l,740k\V. driving model LJ 76 DL Lips 
waterjets. Wilh seven tonnes of fuel and a 
full complement of passengers this gives 
the vessel a cruising speed of 29.9 tonnes, 
range often hours and maximum speed of 
34.2 knots. 
As an alternative to the 6.1, Iris 
Catamarans offers the 6.2, an enhanced 
version able to carry 398 passengers on 
(he same basic size and hull configuration 
by the simple expedient of a double layer 
of passenger modules. Using I he 16V 
version of the MTU engines, a slightly 
increased service speed is forecast and the 
maximum speed is expected lo be 
improved by a little over four knots. The 
bigger version has a larger bow pod to 
allow rearward visibility from the bridge,

JADE EXPRESS: 
testing the Caribbean market 
With 
a speed of 40 knots and capacity 
Tor ten cars and 330 passengers. 
Austat's first mid size Fast ferry in the 
proven Auto Express range of vehicle-
passenger catamarans, entered service in 
the French Caribbean in April/May '98. 
Delivered to L'Express des lies -
the 
fast ferry operation of French Maritime 
Group. Compagnie Chambon, the 48m 
ship was seen as an economical menus 
to test market demand for car carrying, 
with minimal sacrifice to passenger 
capacity. In addition, as it is built to HSC 
Code, the vehicle deck can also be 
utilised For cargo carrying. 
As a 30-miiuiie turnaround in port was 
specified, the car deck has been specially 
designed 
For 
swift 
loading 
and 
unloading. Cars enter and exit the vessel 
via a hydraulic-ally operated 3m port side 
ramp located all on the main deck. This 
system allows the vessels to berth ill 
existing facilities on the island of 
Martinique with only simple shore based 
ramps required to reach die height ol' the 
car deck. Vehicle deck height is 2.1m 
and structural fire protection and 
drencher systems Feature throughout. 
Forward of the ten parking bays is an 
18m: area designated For baggage and 
cargo space. 
Jade Express is fitted with four MTU 
16V 396TFJ4L engines and the Austal 
Ocean Leveller ride control system, 
which features T-foils forward and 
interceptors all on the transom of each 
hull. With a trial deadweight of 49 
tonnes, the vessel achieved a maximum 
speed of 40 knots and a service speed 
(90 per cent MCR) of 38 knots. 
Although operating with two bridge 
crew, four helm chairs are installed in 
Ihe well-equipped wheelliouse. The 
bridge features external wing stations 
wilh Kamcwa controls for precise 
manoeuvring and docking. Olher 
equipment includes an MTU MCS5 
monitoring system. Auslal Ocean 
Leveller control station and NavMastcr 
Electronic Chart Display. As well as 
providing navigalion data for the crew, 
the NavMaster system is linked lo the 
passenger accommodation television 
units ihus acting as an information 
system. 
Passenger 
saloons 
have 
been 
comfortably outfitted wilh an emphasis on 
the use of low maintenance materials. A 
combination of airline style sealing and 
table/chair arrangemenls is used for the 
330 passengers: 196 on Ihe main deck, 54 
in the Upper deck saloon and SO in ihe 
covered aft sundeck. which features 
acrylic-canvas covered 'deck-chairs'. 
On board features include a bar/kiosk 
located aft of the main deck seating area, 
hosless station, television units throughout 
and overhead baggage racks along the main 
deck aisle scats and forward bulkhead on 
the upper deck. Quarters for tlie nine crew 
are located forward on ihe main deck and 
amenities include cooking facilities, 
shower and toilet, television and lounge 
area, 
Safely equipment includes Viking 5m 
evacuation mini-slides situated in three 
stations: amidships, port; starboard on the 
main deck; and aft on the upper deck. In 
tests 128 passengers and five crew were 
evacuated in 13 minutes and 46 seconds, 
almost four minutes under the designated 
time set by the French Hag authorities.

MKL2201: fast RIB 
fashioned for Finland 
In the early 1980s UK boalbuilder Delta 
Marine Services introduced the first of 
an entirely new range of rigid inflatable 
boat. Featuring a high bow sheer, constant 
deep V hull and broad beam, the design 
found ready acceptance with rescue, police, 
patrol and diving authorities around the 
world. In 198-1.approval was received from 
the UK Department of Transport (DTpl 
for fast rescue craft use in the North Sea 
oilfields, thus setting even stricter 
manufacturing standards. 
A highlight for 1997/98 was completion 
of an 11.5m fast daughter craft RIB for the 
Finnish Southwestern Maritime District. 
Although based on the II? or Super X 
Delta range, which is around 60cm wider 
than the 5-5rn-6.5ni Delta Dash range of 
rescue boats, MKL 2201 was closely 
tailored to the authority's specific needs. 
Powered by a single 3406E 7000hp 
commercially rated Caterpillar diesel 
driving a Kamewa FF375S waterjet via a 
Twin Disc type MG5114A gearbox, the 
craft achieved a speed in excess of 45 
knots. 
High speed was a particular requirement 
for the broad range of duties and extensive 
geographical operating area assigned to the 
vessel. Ordered in an administrative 
capacity for fast patrol and pilot duties in 
the provinces of Turku, Pori and Aland, 
its nntlti-role capabilities are put to the test 
in helping to promote good navigation and 
safeguard shipping 
in 
a 
particularly busy stretch of 
water. The district includes 
over 3.800km of marked 
fairways and approximately 
5.000 aids to navigation with 
five pilot stations and an 
international radio station. 
Around 7.500 acts of pilotage 
occur 
annually 
covering 
400,000km. The authority is 
also responsible for vessel 
surveys and inspections and 
the upkeep and development of 
regularly 
scheduled 
archipelago traffic. 
Comfort was deemed as 
important as speed. A fully 
enclosed 
aluminium 
wliculhoLise. derived from die 
proven 95 daughter craft series in offshore 
operation but shortened to suit the 
authority's needs, is fitted with six KAB 
seats, galley and toilet. The interior has 
been laid out for best ergonomics with the 
latest electronic and navigation aids 
including radar, echo sounder. DGPS and

NEUWERK: marine 
disaster prevention in the 
North sea 
Equipped for i! number of roles but 
With strong emphasis on that of iruiri ne 
pollution control, 78.91m x 18.63m 
Neuwerk is now in operalion from its home 
port of Cuxhavcn, servicing the North Sea. 
Described as 
'a 
marine disaster 
prevention ship'. Neuwerk was planned, 
designed, specified and supervised in build 
by 
the 
Watcrerat'l 
Department of 
Germany's 
Federal 
Waterways 
Engineering & Research Institute (BAW) 
and built by the German yard of Volkswerft 
Stralsund. The lines of the .ship are based 
<in conventional designs optimised by the 
Hamburg Ship Model Basin. 
Reinforced to comply with GL Ice Class 
E3, the hull has a stem which tails off 
beneath the vessel into a box-shaped keel. 
This, together with two keel elements 
above the propellers, improves ice-
breaking action and helps clear broken ice 
away from the propellers. The hull is 
divided 
into 
seven 
watertight 
compartments by vertical bulkheads and 
contains stainless steel cargo tanks, which 
are positioned lengthways and completely 
isolated from the sides and bottom by 
cofferdams. There are four in-hull decks 
and four superstructure decks plus a 
helicopter winch deck aft. 
Power is provided by four main diesel 
generator units working in parallel. To 
allow the power generated to match 
demand and thus avoid the low-load 
problems associated with diesel engines, 
three MTU 16V 595 TC50 units, each 
developing 3,00UkW at 1,500 rev/min and 
one MTU I2V 396 TC54 developing 
96()kW, at the same speed, are installed 
side-by-side, just forward of amidships. A 
pair of 2,900kW Schottel Rudder-
propellers with FP propellers, inside 
nozzles, is fitted at the stern and a 2.6()0k\V 
Schottel pump-jet at the bow. On trials, 
the vessel achieved a bollard pull of 113.5 
tonnes and speed of 14.9 knots. A fourth 
generator set of 300kW is provided for 
harbour use. 
Wilh built-in skimming devices and a 
citadel-type interior to protect against toxic 
or explosive external atmospheres, the 
main role of Neuwerk is undoubtedly 
marine pollution control. 
The gas protection system 
extends to all interior 
living and working areas 
including bridge, crew 
quarters 
and 
engine 
rooms. Entrance and exit 
to and from 'the citadel' 
is via gas locks and the 
interior is supplied with 
decontaminated 
air. 
purified through modular 
filter stations, each fitted 
with sub-micron and 
activated carbon fillers. 
Pressure is maintained 
above outside atmospheric pressure to 
prevent the possibility of polluted air 
entering 
the 
citadel 
and constant 
monitoring and failsafe systems arc in 
place. The engines are cooled by a closed 
circuit freshwater system to avoid the risk 
of contamination. 
Neuwerk is equipped with a pair of 
built-in independent sweeping arm 
skimmers for oil spill duties. Developed 
by Jastram Forseluing of Hamburg, each 
measures 15m in length and can be 
deployed at angles of 35 to 65 degrees 
to the ship's side whilst the vessel 
proceeds at under 2.5 knots. Floating 
subsianecs are thus forced by the ship's 
forward movement towards an integrated 
suction pipe and pumped lo gravity

of 
dangerous 
substances. 
Other roles for (lie vessel include 
emergency lowing, buoy lending, fire-
fighting, ice-breaking and policing. For 
ETV operations the ship is equipped 
with a Hatlapa lowing winch of 2,000kN 
brake holding power with 1,000m of 
towrope. Two tugger winches and 
retractable towing pins are also fitted 
and a CCTV system enables all lowing 
equipment to be bridge controlled 
although the NMF deck crane shields 
some of Ihc view. The crane, with 
telescopic jib, is for buoy handling and 
salvaging cargo lost overboard by 
casualties. A retractable sonar, installed 
at ihe base of the foreship, 
can he used In locale sunken 
objects. 
For fire-fighting operations, 
two monitors are carried, each 
with a range of 120ni and a 
throwing height of 45m. One 
monitor is mounted on a 
telescopic mast, which can be 
raised liydraulically to a point 
35m above the waterline. In 
addition, two 370m'' water/ 
foam 
monitors 
and 
a 
].480m7h sprinkler system 
arc installed. The latter system 
can also be used for decontamination 
purposes during gas protected operation. 
Remotely controlled from within the 
bridge, the fire-lighting and lire protection 
systems comply with GL 
classification l;iFi 
f. 
All accommodation is contained within 
the superstructure above main deck level 
and provides lor a normal complement of 
16 plus up to 34 additional personnel. 
Immediately below the bridge, adjacent to 
the captain's cabin, is a large conference 
room spanning the full width of the 
accommodation forward. The bridge itself 
is spacious with a main control console, 
supplied and equipped by STN Atlas, 
positioned right forward, Equipment 
includes ARPA. HCDIS. full GMDSS for

NEW /WE/?: radical 
docking module 
A 
radically different alternative to the 
traditional berthing tug started work 
early in '9S with owners Hvide Marine in 
Port Everglades, Florida. New River, a 90ft 
x 50ft Ship Docking Module (SDM). built 
at Halter's Lockport yard, has impressive 
manoeuvrability and the ability to generate 
a very high proportion of its power in any 
direction 
-
forward, backwards or 
sideways. 
The brainchild of Eric Hvide and 
designed in detail by Seattle based Elliott 
Bay Design Group, the vessel has two 
Ulstein model I65QH fixed pilch Z-Drives 
mounted forward and aft and diagonally 
offset some 2m from the centre-line of the 
hull. Caterpillar 3516BTA engines, 
developing 2,000hp at 1.600 rev/min. are 
positioned at each end of the vessel, leaving 
ample space in the engine room for two 
75kW Delroil Diesel 4-71 generator sets. 
Although later vessels in the series have 
internal ladder arrangements to the 
whcelhouse. New River -
designed for 
operation in a warm climate by a two-man 
crew -
has exterior bridge access with 
cabins opening directly onto the aft deck. 
Visibility from the bridge is excellent via 
halt' height windows forward and lull 
height windows aft. Two island consoles, 
each with main engine and thruster control, 
are positioned at the forward end. 
As New River manoeuvres in all 
directions, the entire 'circumference' of 
its Hat bottomed hull has been protected 
by Schiiyler cut-tyre fendering. It has 
also been equipped with a unique extra 
type of protection, although in this 
instance for ecological reasons - manatee 
guards have been fitted lo the type 19a 
Kurt nozzles which surround the 
2,184mm four-bladed stainless steel, 
fixed pilch propellers. Designed by 
Ulstein Maritime in Vancouver io 
prevent propeller strikes on these 
e n d a n g e re d 
c re a t u r e s, 
the 
g u a rd s 
incorporate hydrodynamicaily contoured 
foil shaped spokes spanning the inlet to 
the nozzles to ensure a smooth water 
flow. 
Deck machinery comprises a Markcy 
DYSF-39 hawser winch with capacity for 
500ft of soflline. This is fitted with a 30hp 
hydraulic power unil. hydraulic drum 
brake, an instrumentation system for 
monitoring tension and single station 
pilothouse controls. A remotely operated 
3.000 galis/rnin Skum fire monitor is 
mounted on lop of the wheelhouse. 
Although the SDM was ABS approved 
at lOV.OOOlbs pull, peaks of around 
ll4,000lbs were achieved when the 
vessel entered service. Slight problems 
were, however, caused 
with 
the 
diagonally opposed and offset thruslcrs 
creating a slight lift as water Hows across 
each adjacent skeg. This elTecl is 
doubled as the bow tends lo go one way 
and the stern the other. In open water on 
a long warp, as required for the bollard 
pull lest, this is sufficient to cause the 
vessel to turn off-line which the 
helmsman naturally corrects by adjusting 
the angle of the Ihruslers. This reduces 
the achievable test bollard pull. 
Slots have been incorporated in the 
skegs of the subsequent deliveries 5/ Johns 
and Esmmbia to solve the problem.

PACIFICAT 1000: superferry for 
Canadian commuters 
North America's newest and largest fast 
ferry, Pacificat IOO(K was clocked by 
the Canadian Coast Guard at speeds 
exceeding 44 knots during builder sea trials 
tiff the coast of British Columbia in 
November '98. Such results For the twin-
hulled wave piercing ro-ro catamaran have. 
according to lead builder Catamaran 
Ferries International (Cl-'I) exceeded the 
expectations of customer, British Columbia 
Femes Corporation (BCFC). 
Vancouver-based naval architect. Roberl 
Allan, designed the mechanical outfitting 
of the giant ferry whilst Philip Hercus of 
Incat Designs in Sydney, Australia. 
produced the basic layout. A consortium 
of Vancouver shipbuilders, headed up by 
CFI -
a subsidiary of BCFC -
has been 
responsible for its construction. 
Measuring 122.5m x 25.8m, the world's 
second largest ferry can carry up to 250 
cars and 1.1)00 passengers on a journey 
between North Vancouver's Horseshoe 
Bay and Nanaimo on Vancouver island. 
Travel time will he 65 minutes at a service 
speed of 37 knots, a reduction of 35 
minutes on the current travel time. 
To 
avoid 
changes 
to 
docking 
configurations and facilities. Pacificat 
I(H)0 has a special drawbridge enclosing 
its lower car deck, which lowers in the 
shape of a monohull after docking. Two 
car decks, both with eight lanes, are each 
designed fora straight drive-through, with 
two lanes on each deck discharging 
simultaneously. 
Two accommodation levels offer a mix 
of airline and restaurant-style seating and 
a variety of entertainment and amenity 
spaces. 
Power is provided by lour MTU 20V 
1163 diesel engines (two in each hull) with 
a total output of 33,500hp <26.00Ok\V). 
These each drive a Kamewa type 112 SI 1 
waterjet via a Renk ASL53 gearbox with 
integral clutch and carbon-fibre shafts. 
Facilities exist within the vessel's 
switchboard computer to automatically 
engage a power management system that 
will compensate power amongst three 
engines should one unit lag. In addition, 
the Kamewa computerised control systems 
allow the steering of each jet to be 
independent, operate in pairs or al! 
together. 
Such propulsion control is coupled with 
computerised navigation and vessel 
management systems positioned in the 
wheelhouse and custom designed by Prime 
Mover Controls and BC Femes' electrical 
engineer, Glen Darling. 
Wiih 1.000 passengers plus crew to 
protect, safety is of prime importance and 
a Dunlop-Beaufort evacuation system. 
comprising two sets of chutes, platforms 
and four 150-person liferafts are located 
on each side of the vessel. The ship is also 
equipped with two approved Zodiac M-742 
rescue boats and passenger areas, ear decks 
and machinery spaces protected by a Hi-
Fop system.

PORTUNUS: first 
of three for ABP 
A new lypc of pilot vessel, developed 
xVby naval architect David Cannell and 
built 
by 
Southampton-based 
yard 
Halinaiic. entered service in the Associated 
British Port (ABP) fleet last year. Lead 
vessel Portunus, the first of ihrec craft to 
be ordered as a modern alternative to 
ABP's traditional favourite - the l-lalmntie 
Nelson - offers higher speeds and a drier 
ride. 
ABP's need to upgrade arose in pan 
because of changes in 
pilot 
boal 
regulations, which had increased the 
displacement of the Nelsons leading to a 
'wet' ride with excess spray on windscreen 
and deck. The new generation solution, 
based on an PRCV (Fast Round Chine 
Vessel) hull form offered an ideal 
alternative. 
The FRCV incorporates a single chine 
nf optimum angle for lift and dryness. well 
rounded topsides above the chine aft, 
warped bottom and reduced deadrise 
towards the transom. According to the 
designer, the hull oilers seakeeping with 
even lower acceleration forces than a semi-
displacement hull form of lower speed 
range. 
"To achieve this, the hull shape has been 
developed with very line entry for excellent 
head sea performance, maintaining the 
centre of lalcral urea of the hull well aft, 
to give superb down sen performance." 
says Cannell, To maintain u dry foredeck 
in heavier seas, a high reserve of buoyancy 
is incorporated into the forward sections 
above the chine. 
The performance is further enhanced by 
highly de\e!oped tunnelling to the 
propellers, which results in lower draft. 
less keel depth and reduced power 
requirements. 
Built in accordance with the MSA Code 
of Practice for Workboals & Pilot Boats. 
Portunus (named for the Roman god of 
harbours) 
operates 
within 
ABP's 
Compulsory Pilotage Area -
a 2S-mile 
stretch of water from Southampton to the 
Nab Channel. Like the third in the series, 
Portuniis has sealing for coxswain, 
crewman and six pilots. The second vessel. 
Prospect, has been designed for a 
combined patrol/pilotage/VIP carrying role 
and seats six with a full si?.c chart table. 
A lop speed of 26 knots - six knots faster 
than the Nelson average -
is derived from 
two V-drive mounted Scania DS1 14 diesel 
engines, developing 52Ohp at 1800 rev/ 
tain. These drive two four-bladed 
propellers via a Twin Disc MG51I4RV

Signihcam Small Craft of 

RPC1150: 
pilot/patrol craft with 
competitive streak 
Versatility and competitive pricing 
were key require incuts set out by 
French yard Raidco Marine Inlernaiional 
when commissioning UK based naval 
architect Alastair Cameron to design a 
pilot/patrol vessel for its commercial cral'l 
portfolio. The first-of-class vessel, 
purchased by West African owners, boasts 
innovative features and was fully 
customised at minimal extra cost. 
Developed from a range of proven 
Camarc multi-chine hull designs, the GRP 
boat has a deep V huli which enables it to 
maintain speed in adverse conditions 
whilst remaining stable at slower speeds. 
A major extra feature is an all-round 
reinforced PU/foam fender system, 
developed by Raidco for maximum 
protection. The system is modular, 
enabling damaged sections to be swiftly 
repaired when necessary and creates an 
easier, safer boarding platform for pilots 
and Other personnel. 
A simple internal layout can easily be 
amended to suit customer requirements 
and a number of superstructure options are 
also offered. For the first vessel a steeply 
raked whcclhouse was selected with 
seating for six pilots or crew plus a 
helmsman and navigator. A small cabin. 
WC and galley is incorporated forward. 
The iowerdeek level comprises a small 
forepcak area divided by a watertight 
bulkhead from the forward void space/store 
and fuel lank space aft. 
The hull can accommodate twin 
propulsion units if required and outdrive 
or conventional propeller installations are 
available. The West African owners opted 
for a single Cummins 6CTA 400hp diesel 
engine driving a Hamilton 291 waterjet -
a package which is reported to give a 2K 
knot cruising speed and exceptional fuel 
economy. With twin engine options the 
vessel should achieve speeds of up to 40 
knots. 
Raidco is marketing the design for 
international authorities seeking a capable 
and cost-effective craft for coastal and 
harbour operations. Delivery of !he first 
vessel led to yet another contract from West 
Africa. Application this time, fora smaller 
10m long version, is fisheries protection 
and three open console vessels were 
selected. Each benefits from (lie special 
foam fender arrangement and has single 
diesels driving waterjets.

RAM 
24: tough RIB on 
proven hull form 
Aluminium hoat builders. SeaArk 
Marine of Arkansas, USA, extended 
iis 
portfolio in early "98 with the 
introduction of a rigid inflatable patrol 
boat Designated [he Ram Class, the new 
concept combines proven hulls from the 
Commander and Dauntless classes with a 
specially designed heavy-duty Lube system 
which can be air or foam filled. 
Deep 21 degree V hulls, developed live 
years ago by C Raymond Hunt & 
Associates, have been selected for their 
performance in rough seas. The following 
advantages are cited; smooth ride in choppy 
waters because of a sharp 45 degree bow 
entry; dry ride due to multiple lift strakes. 
wide chines and highly flared bows; and 
excellent stability, both al rest and 
underway, caused by wide chines afl and 
wide waterline beams. In following or 
quartering seas. Hunt hulls are said to have 
less tendency to yaw or become buried in 
steep sea conditions. 
The Ram collar enhances performance 
in surf or Whitewater conditions by 
providing considerable levels of extra 
buoyancy. In high banking turns, the collar 
contacts the water, reducing roll, and 
stability is enhanced when large numbers 
of people are working over the side. 
Attached to the hull by means of a boll 
rope system on a continuously welded 
track, 
the 
collar 
is 
mounted 
approximately six inches above the load 
waterline. A number of advantages arc 
claimed over conventional RIBs where 
tubes are frequently partially submerged: 
marine growth on the tube surfaces is 
eliminated; the hullfurm. with its wide 
chines, is more efficient al higher speeds 
because tubes are noi dragged through 
the water; the collar is "D" shaped, 
providing greater interior working room, 
working side decks, and foot holding low 
room under the gunwales; and the tubes 
are less .subject to damage from floating 
debris, ice or the caustic effect of oil and 
chemical spills. 
Although introduced as a 24ft model, 
Ram boats range from 21 to 28 feet in 
length and can be powered by outboards. 
stern drives in both gas and diesel 
configuration arid single outboards. The 
latter should have a 30 inch shaft length 
as this will keep the motor's powerliead 
well above the waterline when the boat is 
operated at displacement speeds, such as 
during lowing. When dual outboards are 
selected. 25 inch shaft lengths are 
recommended. 
Engine comparlmenls. sized for the 
largest V-8 gas engine and the longesl 
six-cylinder diesel, are sealed so thai 
oily water cannot leak into the forward 
sections or into the foam flanking the 
engine 
compartment. A welded 
coaming surrounds the engine opening 
to prevent cockpit water from entering. 
With twin 15()hp outboard engines, the 
Ram is able to attain speeds of over 
45mph and can plane up to 30inph on 
a single engine. 
A number of interior arrangement are 
available, with a standard centre console 
an ideal option that maximises working 
space, both fore and aft. Where additional 
weather protection is required, a pilot 
house version provides 360 degree 
gunwale access and year-round protection 
from wind blast. Features comprise a front 
windshield of safety glass liiat opens for

SCOTIA: multi-role fisheries 
research ship 
In March 
1998 
the 
Agriculture, 
Environment and Fisheries Department 
of the Scottish Office accepted a new 
flagship fishery research vessel, (he fourth 
of iis type to bear the name Scotia. Built 
at a cost of Â£21 million, the vessel has 
mulli-role capabilities suited to worldwide 
service and an impressive list of innovative 
fen in res. 
Built by Ferguson Shipbuilders of Port 
Glasgow and designed by Norwegian naval 
architects. 
Skipsleknisk A/S as 
a 
hydrographic research ship. Scotia is also 
well equipped as a fully operational pelagic 
and demersal trawler. Additional tasks 
such as plankton sampling, lowed body 
operations. ROV deployment and acoustic 
research are well within its capabilities. 
Notable features include a retractable 
keel unit housing an array of acoustic 
transducers 
for 
echosounding and 
measuring ocean currents, fibre-optic 
connections linking a broad range of 
sensors and a system of containerised 
laboratories which can be outfitted on shore 
before loading on board. Special attention 
has been paid to the reduction of noise and 
vibration to avoid disturbing scientific 
equipment. 
Propulsion is by means of a iliesel 
electric syslcm comprising three WjirLsila 
9L20/Ansaldo alternator sets, arranged 
amidships. Each unit produce l,485kW 
(l,750kVA) at 1JXX) rev/min and feeds a 
660V. three-phase, 50Hz AC air-breaker 
switchboard. 
Two 
1.500kW 
DC 
propulsion motors, mounted in tandem on 
a common drive shaft, turn a Lips 360mm 
five-bladed FP NAB propeller which is 
designed for silent running at 11 knots 
and is capable of producing 30 lonnes a( 
live knots whilst trawling. An integrated, 
self-lubricated thrust tearing, turning gear 
and torsion meter are incorporated, For 
harbour and emergency use, generators of 
258kW and 315kW output are housed in a 
separate compartment on tlie boat deck 
(three levels up). 
With liiis configuration the vessel lias a 
maximum speed of I? knots and a service 
Significant Small Crait of 
45 

speed of 13 knots, hut for extra economy 
when travelling between survey positions. 
li .speed of 11 knots can be maintained 
using just one out of the three Wartsilii/ 
Ansaldo generators. 
Tcntjord electro-hydraulic spherical 
rotary vane steering gear turns an 8.90m-1 
Ulslein high-lift rudder with active flap 
blade. To further enhance manoeuvrability, 
a 380kW, I375nan diameter transverse 
thtusler is installed below the propulsion 
shafl and a 7(H)kw Elliot omni-directional 
thrusler 
is 
Titled 
at 
the 
bow. 
A 
gyroscopieally controlled Intering twin-
lank roll stabiliser, with resifiently 
mounted air ducts and pneumatic valves, 
is fined amidships. Tanks are incorporated 
fur 275 tonnes of fuel, 77 tonnes of potable 
waler. 24 tonnes of lube oil and 480 tonnes 
of water ballast. 
Considered to be amongst the most 
radical aspects of the ship is the principal 
containerised laboratory store in which four 
20ft wet/dry laboratories are located. 
Positioned in the centre section of the main 
deck, the laboratories can be adapted and 
equipped on shore and loaded in a 
combination that is tailored to each voyage, 
hull services are provided to each 
laboratory when In position by an umbilical 
and (he containers are handled within the 
vessel by a Buitendijk Tcclinik ten-tonne 
overhead travelling crane. 
A sonar laboratory, hospital and small 
mess room are located at liie forward end 
of the main deck whilst the aft section has 
a stern ramp with side gantries and 
recessed trawl doors, open working deck 
and wet fish laboratory. A 'scientific 
hangar', located immediately all of the 
laboratory store, has access to the port side 
via a large roller shutter and is equipped 
with extending arm crane for sample 
recovery. A hydraidiually-operated 
retractable platform deck can be extended 
out over the stern ramp lor operations such 
as buoy handling. 
Galley and communal accommodation 
areas make up the forward end of the 
boat deck whilst the aft end is dominated 
by machinery. A tola] of ten Brattvaag 
winches, a net drum, a series of Aukra 
eltx-iro-hydraulic cranes for container 
manipulation, plankton sampling and 
towed body/cod end handling and an 
Otiim custom-built six-tonne gamma 
frame are positioned. The single funnel 
is offset to port abaft of which are located 
a 5.3m, 25-knot Norsafe waterjel 
propelled workboat and a 3.8m 25hp 
outboard powered Avon RIB. Five 15-
person life rafts are carried immediately 
forward of the 
wheelhouse with 
launching davits on both sides. 
The 
large, 
irregularly 
shaped 
wheelhouse is well glazed and equipped 
with Wynn wipers. Poureousoles. installed 
for control of propulsion equipment and 
manoeuvring, feature a GPS linked 
joystick-controlled Sinirad dynamic 
positioning system interfacing with rudder, 
propeller and both ihrusiers. 
A separate navigation console features 
Ririmo X and S band radars, Dceea 
Navigator and Loran C receiver systems, 
two differential OPSs. two video radar 
plotters, a Simrad Robertson gyro and 
Lillic &. Gilley magnetic compass. 
Communications equipment also merits its 
own console, supplied and fined by UK 
company Ships Illectronics Services. This 
includes 
a 
full 
GMDSS area A3 
installation comprising Inmarsat B and C 
terminals. MF/HF 250 transmitter/ 
receiver, MF/HF Sailor R502 walehkeeper 
and KB DP radio telex.
