S
pecifically designed and built to meet the
requirements of Tahitian ferry company Aremiti
Cruise, the Austal Auto Express 56 catamaran Aremiti
5 is a vessel well equipped to handle the demanding
challenges of providing a vital ferry service between
the French Polynesian islands of Papeete, Morea, and
Bora Bora.
The new ship is the fourth ferry in the Aremiti fleet
and joins two other Austal-built cruise yachts in
Tahitian waters, Tu Moana and Tia Moana. Austal's
existing relationship with Bora Bora Cruises, it
believes, was a significant factor in securing the order
for the new fast ferry, a vessel for which the customer
required a tailored fit-out of a similarly high quality
despite its very different role.
With capacity for up to 700 passengers and 30 cars
Aremiti 5 offers a speed of 35knots at 90% maximum
continuous rating. It is powered by four MTU 16V
4000 M70 diesel engines, each providing a maximum
power output of 2320kW at 2000rev/min. Each
engine drives a Kamewa 71 SII waterjet through a
Reintjes VLJ 930 gearbox.
The interior has been developed by Austal in
conjunction with Tillberg Design and Aremiti Cruise.
The focus in the interior has been to produce a level of
fit-out that is both economical and sensible for the
ferry's role, while also providing passengers with a
comfortable travelling experience. Passenger facilities
on the air-conditioned vessel include a licensed café,
television and video monitors, and a mixture of table
and chair arrangements and aircraft style seating.
The vehicle space on Aremiti 5 is located aft and can
accommodate up to 30 cars. To cater for Aremiti
Cruises' shore side arrangements the ship is
configured for a fast and efficient turnaround via
ramps over the stern and port side of the vessel. On
each side outboard of the stern ramp there are
pedestrian walk-ways for foot passengers. The walk-
way on the port side is sufficiently wide for wheelchair
access.
Throughout the vessel floors are covered with high
quality materials for the wide walkways and other high
traffic areas. Similarly prudent choices have been made
in selecting the ceilings and aluminium honeycomb
panelling.
Passenger seating is located on three decks. On the
upper deck stylish Ocean Tourist aircraft style seating
is provided for 346 passengers in the forward and
midships lounges. Each seat comes complete with
fold-down tables and information pockets and the use
of light tan covers helps to create a comforting
environment. Views ahead of the ship are always an
attraction and passengers in the forward lounge can
relax in comfort while enjoying views around the
horizon.
Separating those two lounges is an amenities block
that also houses a crew room featuring comfortable
sofa seating around two tables, food preparation
equipment and colour TV monitor with VCR.
In the aft lounge, where seating is provided for 156
passengers, a licensed café serves beverages and hot
and cold snacks. Although enclosed this area has an
outdoor feel accentuated by Ocean Outdoor deck
chair style seating. Outboard of the main dining area,
alongside the windows, are rows of three aircraft style
seats.
Below, on the main deck, a lounge with aircraft style
seating for 128 passengers has been provided forward
of the vehicle deck. Like the main lounge above, the
seating is upholstered in a light tan fabric, designed for
easy cleaning. Four aisles separate the seating blocks,
which provide for seating configurations of three
across the entire lounge.
Passenger entertainment and communication is
catered for through a public address system that can
be operated from both the café and the bridge,
incorporating entertainment audio distribution and
general alarm.

his vessel was developed from requirements
given by the Italian Ministry of the Environment,
for surface operations in specific coastal areas,
specifically for removing rubbish and floating debris
from environmentally protected areas.
A short response time was also requested, leading
to a minimum speed requirement of 20knots. The
hull is Gull-shaped, as a balanced compromise
between the large deck area of a catamaran and the
seaworthiness of a monohull.
The vessel is equipped with twin Volvo Penta
stern drives, each delivering a 110kW output.
During tests, it achieved a top speed of
over
25knots. As required, the engines are emission
compliant according to 2003/44/CE (RCD). Diesel
fuel capacity is 600litres in two separate tanks. The
engine room is accessible through a hinged cover,
wide enough to easily remove the engines.
The wheelhouse was carefully designed in order to
comply - where possible - with distances, angles, and
minimum heights required by IMO MSC/Circ.982
and UNI ISO-8468.
The main steering position
includes, in addition to standard engine instruments,
folding crane and forward basket remote controls.
This was required so each deck could have a local-
and a remote-control system.
Deck equipment includes a small folding crane, a
20m3 rubbish tank and a movable basket positioned
forward. Refuse and debris are collected in the tank
which is made of AISI 316 stainless steel and is
positioned between the engine compartment and
the collision bulkhead.
It is removable for
maintenance or rubbish transportation.
Refuse are hauled in through different means:
using hand equipment; using an electro-hydraulic
operated stainless steel basket positioned forward;
or using of a small folding marine crane (for loads
up to 280kg).
A forward basket is made of a stainless steel frame
supporting a wire netting allowing for water
drainage during rescue lifting. This basket remains
folded during high-speed navigation, in order to
reduce wave impact and ensure full maneuverability.
The folding mechanism was developed specifically
for this purpose and this vessel, and is covered by a
patent. Once deployed, the basket remains about
0.20m below design water line, in order to collect,
during navigation at reduced speed, all the floating
debris encountered.
Two electrical bilge pumps are dedicated to the
engine compartment and the rubbish tank
compartment. An emergency mechanical pump can
be actuated by the port engine, and works as bilge
pump or fire pump.
Auxiliary equipment include also a 260litre fresh
water system and a 240litre black water system
collecting bilge drainage. Electrical system includes
a 12V-DC for onboard equipment and a 220V-AC
for shore connection and battery charging.
Firefighting equipment is made up of three hand-
held extinguishers and an automatic powder system
in the engine room. The automatic system can also
be manually actuated from the steering position.

lack Tor II is based on the Series 7, 9.0m hull
commercially developed by RTK Marine and in
use with the UK Ministry of Defence and MCA. The
hull incorporates a high level of
rigid foam
buoyancy, enabling the craft to remain afloat and
upright if swamped. The vessel will also withstand
taking the ground and drying out, remaining stable in
all situations, with no stern gear damage.
The hull is of asymmetric catamaran form with a
wide centre tunnel particularly suitable for twin
waterjet installation with turbulence channelled
down the tunnel. Low deadrise hulls give both a soft
ride and excellent load carrying capability. The hull
is a one-piece moulding of GRP.
The vessel is fully compliant with requirements of
the Maritime and Coastguard Agency for a Class V
and Class VI Passenger Ship operating between
Padstow and Rock across the River Camel.
The machinery and propulsion package consist of
two naturally aspirated marine diesel engines, each
coupled via marine gearboxes and carden shafts to
waterjets. Two Mermaid six cylinder naturally
aspirated 'Manta II' marine diesel engines are set to
the continuous rating of 160hp (119kW).
Each engine drives a close coupled Twin Disc 5050
reverse/reduction gearbox with a ratio of 1.23:1.
The gearbox permits 'back flushing' of the jets in the
event of a blockage.
Two alternator have been installed on Black Tor II
which are engine mounted with a 12DC/55amp
output fitted on each engine.
In addition, four
resilient engine mountings per engine/gearbox unit
have been fitted 
Engine power is transmitted via the close-coupled
gearbox and carden shaft to the drive flange of the
waterjets.
Black Tor II has been installed with two
Hamilton H292 waterjet propulsion system complete
with steering and reverse control components. The
steering system is hand hydraulic.
A hydraulically operated bow ramp forward for
embarkation of passengers, wheelchairs, or bicycles.
Power operated bow ramp using hydraulic rams,
controlled either locally or from the bridge. Engine
driven pump for normal operation (one on each
engine, selectable using a valve). Manual hydraulic
pumps are supplied for emergency use. Freestanding
stainless steel handrails are fitted to the bow ramp
with two lifebuoys.
A GRP moulded cabin is fitted forward of the
wheelhouse which contains passenger seating and a
WC compartment. In the forward section of the
cabin there are doors which are removable for
summer operation. Seating has been installed for 16
passengers int his area, and 48 in the well deck.
There are also two passenger cabins.
Two liferafts have been fitted to Black Tor II.
These were supplied by RFD and are of Ferryman
type. They are stored in GRP containers aft of the
wheelhouse, complete with hydrostatic releases.

T
he Airbus corporation in Toulouse has developed
a new type of aircraft, the A-380. The various
parts of the aircraft are fabricated all over Europe
and the assembly and test facilities are in Toulouse.
Airbus was faced with a logistic challenge of how to
get the various parts to Toulouse. In the past, a
specially built aircraft was used, but this was too small
for the A-380's parts.
A solution of transporting the aircraft parts from
Hamburg, Mostyn, St Nazaire and Cadiz to Pauillac at
the entrance of the river Gironde, by a seagoing ro/ro
ship, was decided upon. From Pauillac a special river
craft would bring the parts to Langon.
Airbus ordered two river vessels, one as back-up. At
times the river Garonne can be very rough, with the
river outside its beddings and with a very high current,
up to 8knots. In case of delay due to adverse
conditions, two ships will be able to work around
delays in shipment. On request from Socatra, the ship
is also able to sail along the coast of Europe. The
vessel can also load road trucks and semi trailers.
The midship section consists of the hold with the
two movable cargo platforms and wing tanks for
changing the draught from 1.3m-2.6m, depending on
the water-level of the river. The cabling from forward
to aft is led in a separated watertight and ventilated
duct from the engine room forward to the propulsion
room aft on starboard and port sides.
The fore ship has been specially designed for a
possible collision with the Bridge Pont de Pierre. The
cargo and the ship could not under any circumstances
be allowed to damage the bridge. Therefore, the cargo
had to be lowered as much as possible. The fore ship
is fuller and more spoon shaped than required with
respect to speed and wash criteria.
There are two hoistable platforms, each of 8.4m x
25.1m. The hoisting mechanism consists of a jigger
winch mounted inside of the platform within the
600mm depth of the beams supporting the structure
of the hoistable platform. In each corner there is a
guide wheel rolling along vertical profiles. Each
hoistable platform can move independently of the
other.
Airbus is very sensitive to environmental criteria
and the ship has been designed for minimal noise
(60dB at 100m at 100% MCR) and wash (16cm at
25m at 8knots). The ship has a very short stopping
distance and a tight turning circle. The antifouling
paint is also environmental friendly.
This 
75m 
vessel 
has 
a 
length 
between
perpendiculars of 73.80m, and a moulded breadth of
13.80m. She has been classified by Bureau Veritas as
a Class 1 Deck Ship for coastal areas.
Three Caterpillar 3508B DI-TA main engines, with
an output of 800kW ensured a trial speed of
11.65knots. Caterpillar also supplied three alternators
to Breuil.
The vessel has been installed with both a bow and
two stern thrusters. The bow thruster has an output
of 400kW and is a Veth omni-directional thruster.
The 735kW stern thrusters have been supplied by
Aquamaster and are type azimuthing 901.

S
panish shipyard Zamakona this year delivered the
first of
two unique emergency rescue and
response vessels to Esvagt A/S in Denmark. Esvagt
Corona started work in the North Sea in late
September, followed a month later by her sister
vessel, Esvagt Capella.
These diesel electric vessels were designed by
Esvagt in cooperation with Zamakona Shipyard, and
with Ole Steen Knudsen acting as consultant, and are
intended to have an operating life of 20 years or
more.
At 44.03m overall, Esvagt Corona and her sistership
are propelled by a pair of electrically-driven 715kW
HRP 5000 L drive azimuthing thrusters, each with
four 1650mm diameter NiAL bronze blades. The
engine features a frequency converter which means
there is low NOx emission and fulfils all IMO
regulations.
The vessels have been classed by Bureau Veritas as
#1 #SDS ~AUT-UMS ~SYS NEQ. They have also
been approved by the Danish Maritime Authorities as
standby rescue for 140 survivors;
and fulfils
Norwegian regulations of 16.10.1991 No 853 as
standby rescue for 236 survivors and UK class B
standby approved for 300 survivors.
The high redundancy engine room design for the
diesel electric engines is capable of maintaining
service with two of four gensets or wit one of four
gensets. The vessel has been optimised for low noise
- to Comfort Class 2.
A bridge-operated 'push button control mode'
features an emergency and rescue mode, a manoeuvre
mode, and standby mode and a harbour mode. The
bridge has a Transas electronic plotter system
including 
search 
and 
rescue 
facilities 
and
documentation of vessel traffic, for example. Remote
fire fighting is also controlled from the bridge area,
and the vessels are supplied with sprinkler systems
throughout.
Depending on operating mode and tasks, the
vessels can be manned with six to 12 man crew - all
accommodated in single cabins with their own baths
and toilets. The rescue zone midship is designed and
calculated in such a way that it will fulfil all the
different requirements for standby ships in the
Danish, Norwegian, and UK sectors of the North
Sea.
The ship's fast rescue craft (FRC) are of two
different types - one being Esvagt's own design, the
well-tested Esvagt Rescue FRC 15 B, with two
specially designed outboard diesel engines, and the
other one being a Norsafe Mako 655, driven by
waterjets, and specifically tested in this role by
Esvagt.
Other special features on the vessels include black
lights in addition to powerful searchlights, for search
and rescue operations, an additional drop zone, two
FRC, and a Dacon scoop. A treatment room includes
a supply of instruments, medicines, and clothing.

he St Petersburg-based shipyard Pella Leningrad
Shipyard JSC has for a number of years been
specialising in small ships production, as well as
GRP craft building. For the first time in Russia, it is
claimed, this yard has started to produce the latest
modern tugs.
Flagman is intended for any berthing and docking
operations, including those in heavy ice conditions,
as well as for operations in the open sea and out of
the harbour area. The tug was actually built for the
Makhachkala Port, located in Russia. With a length
overall of 25.4m, beam of 8.8m, draught of 3.2m,
Flagman carries 93dwt tonnes.
The vessel is equipped with twin Steerprop SP 10
units. Two Volvo Penta engine are rated at 520kW
each, and the tug has a maximum speed of 12knots,
and a bollard pull of 22tonnes. This tug features easy
steering, and enhanced manoeuvrability due to the
azimuthing thrusters.
The powerful propulsion plant has an output of
520kW from two main engines, and tugging power
from 20tonnes to 55tonnes which allows towing
ships with a displacement of up to 140,000tonnes.
The tug has been constructed to the Russian
Register of
Shipping ice class LU3 and all
international rules and conventions. Flagman is fitted
with Rolls-Royce swinging propellers, modern
auxiliary equipment, as well as with the necessary
navigation and communications equipment.
Worth approximately US$3 million, this project
90600 azimuth rescue-tug was the first shipbuilding
experience of the aviation-oriented Moscow-based
JSC Financial Leasing Company (FLC). It was also
the first 'newbuilding under leasing experience' for
Pella.
After successful trials, which began in September
2003, the all-steel tug sailed to the port of
Mahachkala, and in December 2003 she began work
in the Caspian Sea region. The tug has been designed
for out of the harbour canting, berthing, and
piloting operations. Pella now also has a number of
orders for the same class of ships.

T
his Z-Tech design was conceived and developed
by Robert Allan Ltd in response to the
challenges posed by PSA Marine for a new and
versatile class of tugboat for major port operations
worldwide. The objective was to create a distinctive
new design that would represent a breakthrough in
tug technology, at the same time avoiding any
gimmicks that did not offer a real improvement in
performance and safety.
Robert Allan senior staff met with crews and
managers to gain an understanding of the complete
operation and specific tug requirements in
Singapore. What emerged was a clear understanding
that some crews had a distinct preference for the
tractor style of tugs, while others favoured the ASD
type.
Z-drive tractor tugs were generally favoured when
working under large flares of
container ships,
especially when inbound.
ASD tugs however were
favoured because of the overall layout and handling
advantages, especially the obvious feature with the
working deck directly in front of the tug operator.
In addition, the ASD layout offers the distinct
advantage in both construction and maintenance of
fitting the drive units where they can be installed
later in the build process and withdrawn later if
necessary.
One major disadvantage of some ASD designs is 
the strong sheer of the fore deck, which is also the
primary working deck. If significant bow height is
required, then in some cases the foredeck areas can
be unsafe if too steeply sloped.
Also, many ASD designs push the house well
forward in order to accommodate an aft winch,
which may seldom be used. This creates a crowded
and potentially unsafe working area. It also puts the
wheelhouse very close to the side of a ship, and at
risk of damage, especially if working under flares.
Robert Allan proposed that the different
operational advantages of both design types could
be incorporated in one modified style of ASD tug.
The resulting mandate was to develop a single design
that would incorporate the best features of both
types. Only one winch is needed for both harbour
and towing operation by the unique deck
configuration.
The Z-Tech design concept offers a number of
advantages, namely the forward deck has a low sheer,
creating a spacious, relatively flat and safe working
deck, and the aft deck provides just sufficient space
to install or withdraw the Z-drive units.
A small
anchor winch is fitted on this deck.
For sea-going operations, the Z-Tech works astern
in tractor mode, so this part of the hull is more
rounded than typically seen in ASD designs. There
is no appreciable loss of bollard pull or speed in this
direction. Only one winch is required for both
harbour and coastal towing operations.
When
towing long distances, the Z-Tech will simply tow in
tractor mode going astern.
The low sheer forward, coupled with the aft bias of
the deckhouse and wheelhouse enable the design to
work under large overhanging ship flares. The vessel
is a true 'omni-directional' ship-handling tug,
obviously best suited for harbour towage, but
certainly capable of coastal towing duties as well.
The vessel has a length of 24m, a length between
perpendiculars of 25.1m, the beam is 11.5m and she
has a depth of 5.0m. The 325gt Indee is classified by
Lloyd's Register and is fitted with two Caterpillar
3516B-HD engines with an output of 1865kW each.
Two Schottel FP propellers are nozzled, and have a
diameter of 2.4m.

A
ustal has designed, constructed and delivered three
22m patrol boats to the Kuwait Coast Guard
(KCG). In addition to three crew, Kassir, Dastoor, and
Mahroos, can each carry 41 people and will be used
primarily for the transport of KCG crew and personnel
to outlying islands at speeds of approximately 25knots.
The vessels were launched three months ahead of
schedule and met all performance criteria on sea trials
in Australian waters prior to being shipped to the Gulf
region. They arrived on schedule in March this year and
their entry into service was quickly expedited after they
successfully completed acceptance sea trials off the
Kuwait coast.
In addition to the vessels' performance and low
maintenance requirements of
their aluminium
structure, Austal's ability to design and construct
customised vessels within the budgetary parameters set
out by the Kuwait Ministry of Interior was also
instrumental in securing the order.
The interior fit out matches all the specifications for
this application, combining practicality with comfort
and safety. Aircraft style seating for personnel in transit
is located forward on the lower deck where there is also
ample storage space for their effects in overhead
lockers and a forward store.
The wheelhouse sits atop the raised forecastle deck
and contains a spacious bridge ahead of an amenities
area. This area has a galley with food store, fridge,
freezer, and cooker on the portside and a head and
general compartment on the starboard side.
The bridge has the standard arrangement for three
person operations and features forward raked windows
to maximise volume while minimising heat and glare
from the sun.
During the design stage Austal had to take into
account the severe climactic conditions of the Arabian
Gulf. It was a contractual obligation that the vessels
were capable of all weather operation in sea conditions
up to Beaufort 6. Austal was successful in making the
vessels highly effective and versatile in these conditions,
whilst also incorporating reliability and low-
maintenance.
The vessels are powered by two MTU diesel engines
producing a total of
1470kW, driving two FP
propellers. This generates a maximum speed of
25knots, with a range of up to 325nm with a 10% fuel
reserve.

T
he new Austal Auto Express 58 catamaran Lake
Express secured its place in history on 1 June when it
became the first fast ferry to carry vehicles and
passengers in commercial service within the United
States, creating a marine freeway across Lake Michigan in
the process.
Under the Jones Act, US Federal law requires that only
American-built ships can carry passengers between US
ports and in recent times no ferries have been built to
serve the Great Lakes. For the past 10 years the only ferry
service operating across Lake Michigan has been that
between Manitowoc,
Wisconsin and Ludington,
Michigan, operated by a slow-speed coal-fired ship.
Operating between the cities of Milwaukee, Wisconsin
and Muskegon, Michigan, Lake Express provides a
crossing time of two and a half hours.
The establishment of the Austal USA shipyard in
Mobile, Alabama in 1999 facilitated the supply of
advanced fast ferry technology to American transport
planners and operators. This in turn is leading to renewed
interest in the use of high speed vessels for vehicle ferry
operations and other short sea shipping initiatives. Lake
Express is the seventh vessel launched at Austal's USA-
based shipyard and holds the distinction of also being
the largest built at that facility to date.
The new fast ferry offers capacity for 248 passengers
and 46 cars. Every aspect of its design and construction
has been tailored around the specific needs of Lake
Express and its new service. The interior fit-out of the
vessel combines functionality and aesthetic appeal,
featuring seating upholstered in a fabric, designed for
easy cleaning. The floors are a combination of Amtico
and carpet with wide aisles providing ample space for
ease of access to the kiosk, toilets, and other amenities
onboard.
In the main passenger lounge four aisles separate the
seating areas which provide for triple seating at the
extremities and group configurations of four around
centrepiece tables in the centre. Some 200 Beurteaux
Ocean Contour chairs, designed and installed strictly in
accordance with the requirements of the US Coast
Guard, ensure comfort for passengers on the lake
crossing.
Aft of the main lounge is a business class lounge
equipped with wide Beurteaux Ocean Club chairs for 50
VIPs. This facility is also available for business groups
wishing to try something a little different by holding their
conference at sea.
Passenger entertainment and communication is
provided through a public address system that can be
operated from both the kiosk and the bridge,
incorporating entertainment audio distribution and
general alarm. Video and TV-stations are distributed
through the passenger saloon via 14 colour monitors and
audio is distributed via ceiling mounted speakers from
the VCR, compact disc player, cassette player and
AM/FM tuner, which are all operated from an
entertainment rack mounted in the kiosk.
Immediately forward of the service kiosk and toilets is
the crew mess. The latter features upright seating for six
crew, bench type seating around a table, sink with hot and
cold water built into a counter top with cupboards below,
an urn, microwave oven and TV. Crew lockers are also
provided and the area has direct access through to the
bridge.
The bridge onboard Lake Express is fully equipped with
the latest in marine technology including two radars,
DGPS, echo sounder, gyro compass, and overhead
magnetic compass.
The vehicle deck, designed to suit the requirements
of the customer, has the capacity to carry 46 cars.
Catering for the larger cars found on American roads
vehicle lanes onboard are larger than normal with bay
sizes of 5.2m by 2.5m. The inner two lanes offer a
clear height of 2.9m while the outer lanes are 2.6m
high. The maximum axle load is up to 3.5tonnes. The
2.9m high forward door slides open to facilitate drive-
through loading, thus keeping turnaround times to a
minimum.
Access to and from the passenger cabin from the
vehicle deck is easy and for those who may require
assistance, a lift, compliant with all relevant ADA
requirements, is provided. Foot passengers access the
vessel through shell doors port and starboard on the
forward end of the vehicle deck.
The catamaran is powered by four MTU 16V 4000
M70 diesel engines, each producing 2320kW at
2000rev/min, which is sufficient for service speeds of
34knots at 90% MCR.
During speed trials Lake
Express reached a maximum speed of 39knots.
A state-of-the-art motion control system uses
hydraulically actuated interceptors fitted aft to provide
motion damping as well as control of running trim.
The interceptors are controlled by commands from a
central unit which receives motion data from an array
of onboard sensors, computes the required damping
forces and then issues the command signals.

C
ottrell Contracting Corp, a dredging contractor
based in the USA, added a new medium-sized
cutter suction dredger to its fleet of dredgers at the
end of the summer. Vosta LMG designed this
dredger, named Lexington. The vessel was built in
cooperation with Cottrell Contracting Corp at the
Tidewater Skanska Inc shipyard in the USA.
The 457mm cutter suction dredger is the US
equivalent of a CSD500, but has accommodation for
25 people onboard and is built to work in a variety of
conditions. The current fleet of Cottrell Contracting
needed to be extended due to an increase in workload
in the US.
The ship was designed in close
cooperation with the owners, who also supervised the
building at the local yard together with a senior
engineer of Vosta Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Vosta LMG.
Vosta LMG's contact included the engineering of
this dredger and the supply of major components
such as dredge pump diesels and gearbox, generators,
spud carrier, spuds and spud hoisting system,
winches, and a cutter ladder including a SC10
cutterhead. The dredger now carries out maintenance
dredging in the USA.
Lexington can work at a maximum depth of 18m,
and has a length overall of 61m, a breadth of 12m,
and a draught of 1.6m. The dredger can also work in
wide cuts using its long and heavy anchor booms, its
200kN hydraulically driven side wire winches and its
hydraulically driven spud carriage with 25m long
spuds.
The cutter unit, with a maximum available cutter
power of 223kW (300hp), was designed and supplied
by Vosta LMG. This cutter is designed to work in
sand, clay, and cemented soils suitable for 300hp. The
cutting performance can be optimized at dredging
depths of between 6m and 18m below the waterline,
using the variable cutting power.
The vessel has a 457mm suction pipe diameter. The
1194kW (1600hp) Fairbanks Morse-driven inboard
dredge pump can be assisted by a submersible,
electrically driven 600kW (800hp) dredge pump on
the cutter ladder. The combination of both pumps
makes the dredge capable of long distance pumping
and dredging up to 18.28m.
For safety reasons, the pump room has been
separated from the engineroom by a watertight
bulkhead. The optimum layout and use of watertight
doors combines an easily accessible engine room with
high stability and safety.
Two 910kW generator sets are installed to supply
the board net, hydraulic power packs, and ladder
pump. The generator system has been designed to
run separately as well as in parallel. In order to keep
the electrical and instrumentation power net clean,
the power supply systems have been equipped with
the appropriate filters and drive systems. The ladder
pump is direct electric driven by e-motor and variable
frequency drive.
Lexington has accommodation for 24 crew, including
an office, a kitchen/mess room and sanitary facilities.
In order to minimise noise levels, the accommodation
has been furnished with anti-vibration mounts and is,
as much as physically possible, disconnected from the
engine room.
A spacious operating cabin ensures maximum view
on deck and on the working environment. A U-
shaped control desk with conveniently arranged
controls and instrumentation provides an efficient
working environment.
For maximum dredging
efficiency,
state-of-the-art instrumentation and
controls are installed, such as a dredger profile
computer and positioning system. A Vosta LMG
automation system, including velocity and density
management and system and dredging monitoring -
powered by Dredgepack - has also been installed.
After commissioning, trials, and hand over, the
dredger began her first project for Cottrell
Contracting Co. Lexington is being used to accomplish
a US$4.7 million beach nourishment project for the
Philadelphia District, USt Army Corps of Engineers.
Approximately 200,000yards3 of sand will be dredged
from an offshore borrow area and pumped on a badly
eroded adjacent beachfront. Work began in October.

T
he 69.7m anchor handling tug supply vessel, Luzolo,
was delivered to French offshore operator SURF for
duties in the offshore oil fields off the west coast of Africa
at the beginning of this year. This all-steel AHTS, built by
French yard Chantiers Piriou, was designed by Rolls-Royce
Marine.
The vessel has been specially equipped for general
requirements of the deep water offshore industry, and is
capable of standby for rescue, has an oil hose maintenance
system, and can perform ROV and subsea services. Luzolo
has also been equipped for deep water anchor-handling and
towing with two drums as main winches, one drum as a
secondary winch, and one drum as a bow windlass/towing
winch
Main propulsion engines were supplied by Rolls-Royce
Bergen, and are rated 2650kW at 750rev/min. They drive 4-
bladed CP propellers, in 3.8m diameter nozzles. Two bow
thrusters have been fitted on this offshore vessel, one is
800hp, and electrically driven with a thrust of 8.80tonnes
and the other is 1200hp, azimuthing/retractable and diesel
driven with a thrust of 13.20tonnes. An 800hp stern
thruster is electrically driven and delivers 8.80tonnes of
thrust. Bollard pull was specified as 170tonnes.
Five generators: shaft (2 x 2200kVA), emergency (1 x
215kVA), and auxiliary (2 x 312kVA) are provided, two are
powered by Caterpillar 3406 engines, while the third
(emergency) genset has been supplied by Cummins. Two
high lift flap type rudders have also been installed onboard
Luzolo.
The vessel's dynamic positioning system is class II, which
allows: automatic tracking, dynamic positioning, automatic
speed control, and submarine (ROV) auto-tracking. The
system has mixed manual and auto-mode joystick control.
The tug has been classed by BV 1+HULL+MACH as a
supply vessel (unrestricted navigation), tug (fire fighting
ship) and standby rescue vessel (150 survivors Guinea Gulf).
The vessel naturally contains a great deal of emergency
lifesaving equipment, including a fast rescue boat, a rescue
zone with rescue nets on both sides, a helicopter winching
area, benches, sun protection, and sanitary facilities for
survivors, and a morgue for 15 corpses.

A
t the start of December 2004 Rodriquez Cantieri
Navali Spa formally handed over a new 40m all-
aluminium catamaran, Maria Celeste Lauro, to the Lauro
Shipping Company, also of Italy. The ceremony took place
in the port of Fiumicino, Italy, due west of Rome. This
location was chosen as it will serve as the departure point
for the new high speed service to the Ponza Island.
This new vessel and her sisters are needed due to a
partnership with the Italian airline Alitalia to provide
transportation to the Italian islands, including Capri and
Ischia, as well as to Sorrento and the Amalfi coast, for the
airline's passengers flying into Naples. The ships will replace
the old Kolkida class hydrofoils currently serving these
routes.
Maria Celeste Lauro is a CityCat 40 catamaran, yard
number 341. She has a length overall of 40m, a 10.5m
beam, and can carry 320 passengers. She achieved more
than 35knotsspeed during sea trials from her two Caterpillar
3516B diesel engines. A 32knot cruising speed is provided
by two 2000kW diesel engines, coupled to two Kamewa
waterjets.
The vessel is built to RINa class 100 - A - 1.1 - HSC A;
TP and is fully HSC 2000 compliant.
The vessel is fitted with anti-pitch T-Foils located well
forward to maximise their effectiveness and to minimise
the pitching motion. There are also the well-proven
Intruders fitted to the transom to provide for longitudinal
adjustment of the trim whilst greatly reducing resistance
increasing reaction time compared to traditional systems.
Some 300 passengers are distributed on two decks, with
the main deck set aside for economy class guests, which
number 210, and the upper being a more upmarket
business class area, for 90 passengers. There is a snack bar
located on the main deck. The upper and main deck have
reclining aircraft type seating, from Mafos, and some of
these also have tables.
All internal areas are fully temperature controlled with
television monitors throughout and a complete sound
system to add to passenger comfort.
As is typical for such vessels operating in the
Mediterranean, loading is primarily via two aft ramps that
have been designed to be quickly and easily deployed. There
is also a small bow door for the rare occasions that a bow
loading will be necessary.
Maria Celeste Lauro will be followed next year by two
further catamarans presently under construction at
Rodriquez shipyard.

T
he IC 16 M, NB 534, is a new 16m patrol craft
from Dockstavarvet. This vessel is special version
of a similar craft adapted for security operations on the
inland waterways of Russia. The IC 16 M has been
developed from the multi-purpose combat boat 90 H
with an accumulated operating time worldwide of
more than 400,000 hours.
The technical systems
installed on the IC 16 M are based on proven combat
boat 90 H solutions developed for and together with
the Swedish Navy.
The IC 16 M is available in different layouts. The
prototype Enforcer II was designed as a patrol craft and
arranged with a crew accommodation.
The IC 16 M is made in all aluminium with a 
lightweight of less than 19tonnes. The boat is designed,
built, and equipped to meet the requirements of Lloyd's
Register's Special Service Craft Rules for Area G3.
Length between perpendiculars is 15.90m, moulded
breadth is 3.80m, and the displacement is 22.0tonnes.
The draught is 0.9m making the craft suitable for
shallow water operations.
Another key characteristic is the bow ramp for rapid
deployment of reconnaissance units or goods, taken
directly from the Combat Boat 90 H.
The craft can accommodate a crew of six or a crew of
four together with seating for a small boarding party of
10 troops, or as a pure troop transport with seating for
18 troops.
The aft position of the wheelhouse provides excellent
all-around visibility and enhanced crew comfort. The
wheelhouse is also sound-insulated, and the mast is
foldable via a remote control from the helmsman
position.
IC 16 M is powered by two MAN diesel engines, type
2842 LE 410 with an output each of 820kW at
2100rev/min. The propulsion system is two Rolls-
Royce FF 410 waterjets, operated via hydraulic clutches
and flexible shaft couplings, giving the boat excellent
manoeuvring capabilities with a cruising speed of
40knots and a sprint speed exceeding 50knots. Two
Bosch alternators have an output of 120A (24V) each,
and two KHR 320 Stromag gearboxes have also been
installed. This unit is customised with a 3.4m RIB
stowed in a launch ramp on the aft deck.

T
his twin screw steel WB18 workboat, named
Prince Rock, was developed by UK-based VT
Halmatic as a robust, hardworking, and versatile
workboat, capable of carrying out a wide range of
duties for its owner, the Cattewater Harbour
Commission,
located 
in 
Plymouth,
UK.
Responsibilities of
this vessel include towing,
pushing,
dredging,
offshore 
support,
civil
engineering support, cargo carrying, buoy handling,
salvage, and other general workboat duties.
The WB18 was developed as the largest in
Halmatic's range of workboats and incorporates
significant bollard pull (of 19.0tonnes), a good load
carrying capability, a moderate draught (2.5m), and
high stability and manoeuvrability.
The WB series hull form was designed from the
keel up, to incorporate a wide conventional bow
which offers good pushing abilities and a double
chine hull for good seakeeping and stability.
The vessel is 18.87m long, has a beam of 6.56m,
a displacement of
100tonnes, and a moulded
breadth of 6.56m. Maximum speed is 12knots, and
Prince Rock's service speed is 10knots. Maximum

n March 2004, the Minister of Transport, Public
Works, and Water Management, Mrs K M H
Peijs, inaugurated the new foot/bicycle ferries
Prinses Máxima and Prins Willem-Alexander.
The
contract for these ferries was signed almost exactly
two years previously. The two ships were built in
the 'back yard' of their area of operation, at the
Royal Schelde in Vlissingen, a subsidiary of the
Damen Shipyards Group.
The ships, which are identical, are SWATH vessels
(small waterplane area twin hull). In SWATH
vessels, the part of the vessel that is visible above
the water surface 'flies' over the water, with the
upward force generated by two parallel torpedo-like
hulls located deep under the water surface.
These torpedoes are attached to the above-water
part that houses the accommodation by means of
thin streamlined struts, which pierce the water
surface. Because these struts are so slim, waves have
a very small effect on the ship's motions.
In
practical terms, this means that even at wind forces
of around 9 on the Beaufort scale and wave heights
of 2.5m, passengers and crew will experience a
comfortable crossing. At 37.71m in length, the
vessels have a vertical acceleration of 1m/s2 (SSA).
Two 26in flat screen monitors, as part of a DVD
entertainment system, have been installed onboard.
Royal Schelde was chosen to build these ships as
this yard is a specialist in designing and building
light steel hulls. The high-tech nature of the ships
and the possibility of maintaining the ships and if
necessary, carrying out repairs meant that an
authority in this type of vessel was necessary.
The two ships are owned by the Province of
Zeeland and will be operated by the BBA, a
subsidiary of the Connex Group. They made their
maiden voyages in April 2004.

F
jellstrand AS delivered the first FerryCat 120, Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, to Istanbul Deniz Otobusleri Sanayi
Ve Ticaret AS (IDO) at the very end of 2003. The
second FerryCat, Fatih Sultan Memet I, followed in
February 2004. The new FerryCats operate between
Kartal and Yalova in Istanbul, a route that takes
approximately 30 minutes.
This Norwegian builder introduced the FerryCat 120
in 2003. The concept is a double ended, medium speed
car and passenger ferry based on a catamaran hull. In
most cases, it is claimed, one Ferrycat can replace two
traditional ferries.
Length of the vessels is 80.8m, and the beam is
20.8m. Gross tonnage is 2942gt and the design
deadweight is 280tonnes.
The vessels have been classified by Det Norske
Veritas to DNV + 1A1, LC, R4, Car Ferry TÜR, E0.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Fatih Sultan Memet I will be
sailing with a Turkish flag.
The vessels are installed with four MTU 396 TE 74 L
main engines which have an output of 1500kW. Usual
types of double-ended ferry require the majority of
power to be applied at the stern, which can lead to
comlicated transmission systems or non-optimum
engine loadings. However, on these ferries, the
combination of the Rolls-Royce Azipull thrusters and
the catamaran hull allows all four FerryCat engines to
be run at the most efficient part of their fuel
consumption curve, with a 60/40 aft/forward power
division the ideal. In addition, the low structural weight
compared with typical double-ended ferries allows
brisker acceleration and deceleration, so that a given
berth to berth time can be maintained with a lower
service speed and hence reduced power and fuel
consumption.
Four azimuth thrusters are placed one at each corner
of the vessel and hydrodynamically integrated with the
bulbous ends of the catamaran hulls. Each thruster is
driven by a direct coupled high speed diesel engine. A
total power of about 4 x 1340kW is used to maintain
22knots. Since each propulsor is steerable through
360degs 
and 
has 
a 
CP 
pulling 
propeller,
manoeuvrability is good.
On trials, the FerryCat could stop in two ship lengths
from 24knots using reverse pitch alone. Normally, the
vessel will be steered by means of a new programmable
joystick system developed by Rolls-Royce, but forward
and aft pairs of thrusters can also be controlled by
levers if the navigator wishes.
Two alternators from MTU, type 6R 183 TE 52, and
from Stanford MCH 434H, which have outputs of
1500rev/min have also been included onboard.
The vessels have a capacity of 584 passengers. There
is a crew of 10, and four cabins have been installed.
Capacity for cars is 112, or a mix of cars and trucks, all
on one vehicle deck.
A 180deg rotatable wheelhouse onboard Recep Tayyip
Erdogan and Fatih Sultan Memet I ensures a high degree
of safety. The MOB boat davit has been supplied by
Vestdavitand is of type PLA-850.
Bridge electronic included on these Turkish
sisterships includes two Furuno FR - 2115B radars, a
Simrad AP9 MK-3 autopilot, a Furuno FM 8500
GMDSS, and a Furuno GP 90 GPS.
Engine
monitoring and fire detection systems have been

n May this year, Shipyard De Hoop, based in The
Netherlands, delivered the day passenger ship
RheinEnergie
(yard 
number 
404) 
to 
Köln-
Düsseldorfer German Rhine Line (KD), which
currently uses it as a theater vessel. However, KD
also uses the ship in its normal scheduled service
between Cologne and Mainz.
This new flagship vessel is named after the
company's partner GEW RheinEnergie AG, which
supplies the whole of the Rhine area with electricity
and water. The catamaran will operate 12 months a
year, being used in winter mainly for the numerous
carnival events in the Cologne area.
This vessel, thought to be unique in Europe, was
designed by Shipyard De Hoop, with Groendijk
Design responsible for the extraordinary exterior
and interior styling. The construction was designed
in accordance with Lloyd's Register Special Service
Craft Code with a significant wave height of 1.2m.
RheinEnergie measures 90m in length and is 19m
wide with three decks and a generous sundeck. At
the centre of the ship is a 9m x 5m stage, with an
area of 35m2, and a height clearance of 5.90m which
has its own artistes' changing-room and entrance. In
able to create this space, as well as space for the
spectators, a catamaran hull concept was selected by
the designers.
Passengers are seated on two decks,
both
overlooking the stage. A deck height of 6m ensures
a very spacious feel. The sundeck has an area of
1200m2 and includes a children's playground with
slide, paddling pool, rocking horses, climbing frames,
and carousel rides. In total 1000 passengers can be
seated inside, but the ship can carry up to 1650
passengers.
Three bars on the main and upper decks and
another on the sundeck add to the theatre
atmosphere.
Naturally,
RheinEnergie
features a
sophisticated sound and lighting system as well as
having equipment installed to support modern
methods of presentation including monitors, video
screens, etc.
Extensive seating and large windows will give a
great number of passengers the chance to sit 'on the
balcony'. There is also a panorama lounge at the fore
end of
RheinEnergie. There is access for the
handicapped, with a lift to all decks. A number of
cycle racks have also been provided.
The lower deck is taken up mainly by the ship's
kitchen, which will of course be fitted with the latest
technology. The galley is in fact located under the
stage in the bridge between the two hulls. There are
22 twin-bedded cabins on the lower deck for the
nautical and catering staff. There are a total of 30
members of staff onboard.
The ship is fitted with two Deutz TBD620V8 main
engines of 860kW at 1800rev/min. Each engine
drives a Schottel rudder propeller. RheinEnergie is
also fitted with a Gerlien - Van Tiem bow thruster in
each hull. These thrusters are each driven by a MAN
B&W diesel engine of 250kW.
For power generation, the ship is fitted with two
MAN B&W diesel generators of 443kW each, and
two Leroy Somer alternators of 414kW each. One
MAN B&W diesel generator of 95kW driving a
Leroy Somer alternator of 80kW is also fitted as
emergency generator set.

M
yklebust Verft in Norway has delivered a
multipurpose field supply vessel of a new design
to DOF Rederi AS. Skandi Captain is a 74.3m long ship
of 3330dwt, with diesel electric propulsion and a
maximum speed of 14.5knots, designed to carry all the
liquid, powder, and dry supplies needed offshore.
To meet the owner's requirements, Marin Teknikk
developed a new design, type named MT 6009, and the
building contract was placed with Myklebust Verft, a
shipyard in the Kleven Maritime group. Hull steelwork
was fabricated at Severnav Shipyard in Poland and the
vessel was then taken to Norway to be fitted out.
Marin Teknikk has created a hullform with sleek lines,
a bulbous bow, and azimuthing thrusters under
streamlined headboxes. There was a recognised need in
the market for a smaller supply vessel than the MT6000
with diesel electric propulsion to give operating
flexibility. Discussions with DOF led to the MT6009 and
Skandi Captain. Apart from supply work, the MT6009 is
also a good platform for lighter ROV operations.
Skandi Captain is built to a high standard with DNV
class notation +1A1, EO, SF, DK(+), HL(2.5), AUT
(DP), LFL*, CLEAN, COMF V(3), confirming that
close attention has been paid to achieving low levels of
noise and vibration.
Four Mitsubishi S12R-MPTA engines running at
1800rev/min are coupled to generators each providing
1270kVA at 690V. The generators, like the rest of the
electrical system, were supplied by Siemens and the two
F3D 1 frequency converters feed the two 1470kW
propulsion motors. These in turn drive a pair of Ulstein
Aquamaster US205 azimuth thrusters with contra-
rotating propellers for main propulsion.
For manoeuvring, and in conjunction with the
Kongsberg Simrad dynamic positioning system and
joystick, thrusters at the stern are assisted by two 800kW
tunnel thrusters from Rolls-Royce located at the bow.
Engine cooling requirements are handled by Boksma
boxcoolers.
High plated bulwarks enclose the 51m by 13.4m cargo
deck, on which up to 600tonnes can be carried. Two
tugger winches are located at the forward end under
shelter, with two deck cranes from Effer and ABAS
above. Ten openings each side give access to the
alleyways. At the stern the inner rail is vertical, but the
transom is extended to provide space for deck stores, a
walkway and the two aft mooring capstans.
Apart from the 684m2 cargo deck, Skandi Captain can
transport liquid and bulk cargoes in extensive tankage,
including 612m3 of fresh water, 1,151m3 of fuel, 1,078m3
of liquid mud, 422m3 of brine, 910m3 of drillwater,
270m3 of base oil, and 210m3 of methanol. Water ballast
capacity totals 910m3, and altogether 320m3 of cement
can be carried in the bulkhandling system, which has five
tanks along the vessel's centreline flanked by the liquid
mud and ballast/drillwater/brine tankage.
The Allweiler cargo pumps are mainly located at the
forward end of the compartment. Rolls-Royce supplied
the bulk handling system as part of an equipment
package that in addition to the thruster outfit also
included the deck machinery.
Comfortable accommodation is provided in the
forecastle and superstructure for a total of 22 people; 14
crew plus 8 passengers, with full facilities including a
trim room and conference room/office. There are 12
single cabins including suites for the senior officers,
three twin berth cabins and one four berth, all with
showers and toilets attached. Accommodation is
arranged on three deck levels, access from deck to deck
being by spiral staircases each making half a turn
between decks.
Control consoles are positioned forward and aft in the
wheelhouse. The forward set used mainly in transit
comprise a wide U-shaped console with the main
screens, and an overhead panel incorporating compass,
thruster status and other information. A chair slides on
rails running side to side. The aft-facing working station
has a chair between two consoles. To give a clear view to
the side from the consoles the radio station, positioned
at the starboard side of the bridge, is placed down three
steps at a lower level.
A Viking 470 GRP man-overboard boat can be
deployed from a Polardavit davit system, and the
lifesaving outfit includes four Viking rafts.

T
he first of the entirely new Spirit class of fast
passenger ferries has proven to be a reliable
workhorse for her new owners. Spirit of Skye entered
service with West Highland Seaways on 2 June 2004,
with the keel laid in early January of the same year.
The vessel’s requirements were to carry 36 passengers
and two or three crew on a twice daily return journey
from Gairloch to Portree on the Isle of Skye, a distance
of 27miles. The time required to complete the journey
was an hour and a half, requiring an average minimum
speed fully loaded of 18knots.
The vessel was required to carry 25 passengers plus
one wheelchair user in a sheltered cabin with good
visibility of the local scenery. The remaining 10
passengers were to be seated on the aft deck.
Spirit of Skye has a length overall of 14.80m and a
length between perpendiculars of 12.00m.
Her
moulded breadth is 3.95m and moulded depth is 1.40m.
The vessel has a gross tonnage of
12.9gt and
displacement is 12.9tonnes. Lightweight is 8.6tonnes.
Fuel consumption was to be kept as low as possible,
combined with good motion characteristics. Spirit of
Skye actually consumes 55litres per hour when the
engine is running at 85% MCR. Ace Marine Ltd chose
to employ a narrow planning monohull of deep V
form, supporting six rows of reconditioned airline
seats, providing comfortable and lightweight seating for
the cabin forward.
The hull form was designed as an optimum
compromise between meeting the requirements for
static intact and damage stability, and a minimum GM
for dynamic comfort.
The vessel was also required to comply with the new
EU Passenger Ship Safety Regulations, the Workboat
Code of Practice, and local MCA requirements. This
allows the design to be marketed across the European
Union. The vessel did not require classification.
Draught restrictions at low water in Portree Harbour
required careful selection of the propulsion system. The
performance of the chosen Ultrajet305 units, which are
coupled directly to the Cummins 6BTA5.9M engines, is
better than expected, pushing the vessel to over 30knots
lightly loaded. This saves on weight and running costs
and complications of the gearbox. The vessel cruises
comfortably at between 18knots and 20knots at 85%
MCR fully loaded.
The build time was extremely quick from Sandy
Morrison Engineering, located on Uig, Isle of Skye.
This company's investment in state-of-the-art CNC
plate cutting machinery, coupled with parts generation
directly from the computer model in Maxsurf meant
parts could be designed, e-mailed, nested, cut, built, and
fitted within hours if required.

A
grant from the UK Department of Transport to
Robert Wynn & Sons covered 99% of the costs
of building the 80m multi purpose pontoon, Terra
Marique.
This vessel will transport the largest and
heaviest abnormal indivisible loads by commercial
waterways and short-sea routes.
Terra Marique is registered in the UK in the Port of
Newport Gwent, and meets requirements from the
Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Flag
Authority for a Class XI (A) vessel (unmanned at sea).
The vessel has been constructed under special survey
in accordance with the rules and regulations of Lloyd's
Register +100AT Barge UK Coastal Service,
occasional voyages on the North Sea below line
Petershead to Kristiansand in reasonable weather, LA,
strengthened for loading/unloading aground, ES
(+20% shell and deck plate) * LMC (Limited
Manoeuvring Capacity).
The vessel is fitted with three hydraulically-operated
roadway systems, each capable of lifting a payload of
400tonnes, a watertight stern door and inbuilt stern
arrangement, watertight hatch covers, two deck cranes,
and a power gantry system. A four point mooring
system, and two spud poles are also provided.
A semi-automatic computerised ballast and loading
system is also installed, which links into the vessel's
AMS (alarm and monitoring system). The ballast
capability is provided by six 680m3/hour pumps. All
equipment is certified by Lloyd's Register, including
the roadways, power gantry, and skid systems, which
are certified under Lloyd's Lifting Appliances
regulations.
Whilst at sea, Terra Marique is towed as unmanned -
'dead' - tow, but an alarm system is fitted that indicated
if she is taking in water.
This is indicated by a
masthead light.
When in MCC Category D and above waters, it is
possible to manoeuvre the vessel using her own
propulsion system. A pair of 670kW Caterpillar
diesel drives, outputting 630ekW, provide the power
to four pumpjets (each 200kW).
Terra Marique will provide a system that can access
inland 
locations 
such 
as 
Leeds,
Windsor,
Nottingham, Rotherham, Worcester, and York,
carrying up to 300tonne single piece loads, or single
pieces or multitudes to 400tonnes.
Some inland
locations in North West Europe can also be
accessed.
This is reliant of the fact that Terra
Marique can be semi-submerged and docked for
seagoing voyages.
The vessel can also operate within the rivers and
estuaries, and larger inland waterways of the UK
and North West Europe. Terra Marique can beach
land to enable direct delivery of
abnormal
indivisible loads to a number of costal sites, both
existing and unprepared.

T
he offshore vessel Viking Avant, was designed
by Norwegian company Vik-Sandvik, built by
Aker Langsten, and classed by Det Norske Veritas.
This new type of platform supply vessel - new
because like an oil tanker the bridge and
accommodation areas have been positioned at the
aft of the ship - has been designed to carry out
regular supply and cargo transport functions in the
oil industry. Once delivered, the vessel entered a
five-year charter to Statoil for operation in the
Barents Sea on the Snøhvit development.
With a length overall of 92.17m, and a length
between perpendiculars of 84.8m, the design of this
vessel ensures a safe bridge layout due to fewer
consoles, reduced noise and movement, a less
complicated cargo space, improved hull lines, and
safe loading and discharging. In addition, Viking
Avant had a reduced building cost compared with
similar types of vessel.
The vessel's depth to the first deck is 9m, and she
has a summer draught of 7.5m. With a deadweight
of approximately 5850tonnes and a deck load of
about 4200tonnes the vessel can carry significantly
more cargo than most of the supply vessels available
at the moment.
The accommodation area is located aft to reduce
movement and noise; crew comfort was the original
reason for this different superstructure location, due
to high crew turnover levels.
DNV's noise and
vibration department concluded that this design
reduces noise in all operating conditions and by as
much as 10dB while using the dynamic positioning
system. As the working deck is located forward, only
one main control position is required, against the
normal requirement of two full sets. This greatly
reduces the possibility of human error.
Power supply is via four Caterpillar 3516B diesel
engines, each with an output of
1800kW at
1800rev/min, supplied by Pay & Brinck Motor,
which is linked to a generator with an output of
690V. This company also supplied the emergency
generator type Caterpillar C9 of
250kW, and
Aargilon SCR for cleaning of the exhaust gases.
This SCR system is for the cleaning of exhaust gases,
for the reduction of NOx emissions. The owners
have calculated that NOx savings will be
approximately 77tonnes per year.
The power systems are connected to a pair of ABB
steerable pod propulsors with FP, four-bladed
propellers turning at a variable rev/min. These
contra-rotating propellers have an output of
3000kW each. The propellers have a diameter of
3300mm. Mooring and anchoring are assisted by
two stockless anchors,
each controlled by
windlasses/mooring winches. There is also a double
mooring winch located aft. Viking Avant has been
installed with two (1000kW each) Brunvoll bow
thrusters, and one retractable azimuth type AR-63 of
880kW.
The design of this vessel means that only one
manoeuvring position is necessary. Thus fewer
bridge consoles are required, and the risk of human
and system errors are reduced. There is 360deg
visibility from bridge console. The bridge solution is
in accordance with DNV's Naut Bridge. The
electronic bridge installations were supplied by
Kongsberg Maritime.
De-icing ability was essential on Viking Avant. The
vessel can heat the forecastle, bow area, railing, and
gangway and has been classed with the notation
DeIce-C, one of the first vessels with this particular
notation.
To ease cargo handling in harbour areas, a ro-ro
tunnel cuts through the superstructure. This design
has a slipway in the tunnel so the vessel can also lift
lifeboats. Emergency lifesaving equipment includes
a Norsafe man-overboard rescue boat, a telescopic
launch/retrieval system, and other essential life-
saving appliances according to SOLAS.
Accommodation consists of two two-berth cabins
as well as 16 one-man cabins with separate
bathrooms, along with a galley, mess, and two
dayrooms. There is an office, lobby, changing room,
a health/fitness room, a hospital, deck stores, deck
workshop, and a refuse handling room.

W
haling City Express is a 29m long catamaran
ferry which was designed in Australia, by
Crowther Designs, and was built in three different
shipyards to speed its completion, for the owner
New England Fast Ferry Co (NEFFCO). The vessel
was christened in May, eventually delivered in June
2004, and she began service the same month.
This catamaran vessel makes a number of round
trips everyday, and throughout the year from New
Bedford to Martha's Vineyard, in the USA, and will
cater for tourists, local residents, and commuters.
NEFFCO will operate Whaling City Express under
contract from the Woods Hole Martha's Vineyard
and Nantucket Steamship authority year-round in
passenger and dolly freight service from New
Bedford to Martha's Vineyard. Her crossing time is
less than one hour.
Employing an accelerated construction program
by subcontracting the hull construction to Kvichak
Marine Industries of Seattle, Washington, Derecktor
Shipyards completed construction in only eight
months. Derecktor has started construction of a
second NEFFCO vessel, which is scheduled for
delivery in the spring of 2005. This second ferry will
be constructed completely by Derecktor Shipyards.
The all-aluminium Whaling City Express is powered
by two Detroit Diesel 16V2000 engines with an
output of 1050kW (1410hp). These drive two
Henley Tiger 40in FP open propellers which provide
a service speed of 29knots with a full load of 150
passengers. The vessel achieved a top speed in excess
of 31knots during sea trials. She has been classified
by the US Coast Guard to Subchapter 'T'.
Passenger accommodation is with aircraft quality
seats on two decks with 126 passengers seated in a 2-
4-4-2 arrangement on the main deck and 28 seated in
a 2-2-2 configuration on the upper deck. Exterior
seating is also provided on the upper deck for 38
passengers, to allow the option of open-air travel.
The lower deck has access for handicapped
passengers. Crew number a total of three.
Whaling City Express features a large bar on the
main deck, which conforms to the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines and is equipped
with a four-season HVAC system. A computer-
actuated dynamic ride control system, supplied by
Maritime Dynamics,
provides stability and a
comfortable ride whilst sailing. Contracted sound
levels on the main and upper decks and bridge were
met or exceeded.
Whaling City Express boasts ample storage space in
the passenger cabin for luggage and 16 bicycles.
Storage carts will allow the crew to quickly load and
unload over 4000pounds of luggage and dolly
freight.
The pilothouse is equipped with the latest and
most up-to-date navigational equipment, including
three steering stations and a full compliment of
Furuno electronics. A flat-screen monitor on each
deck shows the vessel's location, speed, and
remaining travel time. This monitor can also list air
and water temperature.
