T
he Marine Ambulance 941, built by Dockstavarvet
for the Royal Swedish Navy, encompasses speed,
patient comfort, and security. The new vessel has the
same facilities as the most modern road ambulance,
and the boat is fitted with armour protection
withstanding 7.62 Nato Ball and collective NBC-
protection.
The craft was delivered to the navy and will undergo
evaluation and tests for about a year within the
amphibious forces, but positive comments have been
received from a number of Swedish authorities, as well
as from representatives in other countries.
The new vessel is based on the CB 90 H platform
and can carry up to four patients on stretchers. The
three-man crew is supplemented by four medical
orderlies.
The troop transport compartment is converted to a
medical treatment accommodation and the original
passenger seats have been replaced with four stretchers
and extensive equipment including a fixed oxygen
system.
The interior has been designed with care for easy
cleaning and maintaining an antiseptic environment. A
monitoring system is fitted detecting high oxygen levels
onboard, and is connected to automatic fans. The
patients are taken onboard the vessel through the aft
hatch or via the bow ramp enabling access to
unprepared beaches. The bow ramp also provides a
useful platform when retrieving patients from the
water.
Designed by the Swedish Defence Material
Administration, 941 has a length overall of 14.9m, a
waterline length of 13.0m, and a moulded beam of
3.80m. With a deadweight of 3tonnes, the vessel has a
sprint speed of 40knots, and a cruising speed of
35knots. 941 has not been classified, but was designed
to Det Norske Veritas HSLC.
The vessel has been installed with two Scania DSI14
engines, giving an output of 497kW each. In addition,
two Bosch alternators each give an output of 120A,
24V, and a pair of Rolls-Royce waterjets, model FF410,
have also been fitted.

S
trategic Marine launched the first of four 40m crew
boats in August 2005, with three more to follow.
These vessels are fast, sea kindly, and state-of-the-art.
Two of the four vessels being built have been sold to the
Malaysian Ship Operator, Syarikat Borcos Shipping Sdn
Bhd. The vessels primary use will be to transport rig and
production crew and equipment to and between oil and
gas platforms and rigs.
Borcus Firdaus 1 is powered by two Cummins 1350 HP
KTA 38 and one Cummins 1800 HP KTA 50 diesel
engines driving three propellers through Twin Disc MG
6690SC reverse reduction gearboxes. It has a top speed
of 30knots and a partial loaded operating speed of
25knots.
The main cabin is passenger ferry standard with
reclining seating for 80 people, and is fitted with tropical
standard air-conditioning and a video and audio
entertainment 
system.
The 
bridge,
with 
two
manoeuvring stations, is on the upper level, with air-
conditioned crew accommodation for 10, a galley, and
bathroom below decks.
Care for the environment has been a major factor in
the design and outfitting that include an oily water
separator and sewage treatment system.
The crew boat has two control stations - one, as
expected, facing forward with the second, smaller station
facing aft. The aft control station is used when the boat
is operating from the stern and/or manoeuvring in and
around the platforms. Loading and offloading of crew
and gear is traditionally done with the boat stern-to and
the transom is left open for this purpose.
The entire vessel is constructed out of aluminium,
whereas seawater piping is all stainless steel. The cargo
deck is covered with a protective layer of thick pine
planks which protect the structure from shock loads
during cargo handling and minimises the possibility of
cargo sliding. The planking can be easily removed to gain
access to the engine room located in the centre of the
vessel. Cargo deck capacity is 2tonnes/m2 and the total
deck capacity is 50tonnes.
The crew boats were designed by Southerly
Designs/Strategic Marine and constructed by Strategic
Marine. Strategic Marine supplied the cut plate package
and equipment from their Henderson facility, in Western
Australia, and constructed the vessel from its Jurong
Facility, located in Singapore.

moulded of 3.53m. Capt Rudy has a gross tonnage of
498gt itc/92grt and a net tonnage of 163nt. Design
draught is 2.9m, and design deadweight 625tonnes.
The vessel, classified to the American Bureau of
Shipping and Loadline USCG Certificate of inspection
under subchapter L, ITC tonnage certification under
500gt, is powered by two Cummins KTA 38MO diesel
engines. Two open propellers, made from NiAl Bronze,
have been manufactured by ST. The vessel has also
been equipped with a bow thruster, supplied by
Schottel, which has an output of 270bhp, driven by
Cummins N 14 through a Twin Disc gear.
The substantial cargo deck on this mini supply vessel
measures 33.52m by 9.14m, and this deck has a capacity
of 498tonnes. Other capacities include: liquid mud -
1230 barrels; methanol - 44,600 US gallons; and fuel -
57,200 US gallons.
A dynamic positioning system, from Beir IVCS has
been fitted to Capt Rudy.

esco Sakhalin has been designed to perform a dual
role as icebreaker and supply vessel.
She will
support the Exxon/Mobil Orlan platform, working in
the Sakhalin sector of the Russian Far East oil fields,
where ice rubble build-up against the platform base is
a continuing hazard in winter.
The 'double-acting' concept allows a ship's fore body
to be developed conventionally for open water sailing,
without icebreaking restraints, leaving the aft body lines
to be optimised for running astern into thick ice.
Additionally, with the pods operating in the tractor
mode, the propellers wash ice off aft underwater
surfaces, thereby reducing resistance. Incorporating
these features (but retaining a traditional ice-breaker
stem) into the design of Fesco Sakhalin is, therefore,
expected to greatly improve the vessel's capability for
dealing with ice ridges up to 20m deep and 4m
consolidation, and level ice up to 1.5m thick. To meet
these requirements whilst working in temperatures
reaching -40OC, Det Norske Veritas Ice-10 standards
have been complied with.
The now standard supply vessel profile has been
adopted for this large and versatile vessel which
features a typically bulky forward superstructure,
incorporating an open-plan wheelhouse with forward
and aft control positions. The substantial open working
deck is timber sheathed and served by a 10tonne crane,
used also for workboat and oil-spill equipment
handling.
Major interest in the design, however, lies in the
machinery installation, centred on a diesel-electric
package put together by ABB, co-developer with
Kvaerner Masa (now Aker Finnyards) of the double-
acting principle. Primary power is generated by three
Trieste-built Wärtsilä 8L38B medium-speed engines,
each developing 5800kW and each coupled to a
6847kVA ABB alternator.
As well as satisfying domestic needs, these supply a
pair of Azipod V16 6500kW, FP propulsion units,
capable of rotating through 360deg but particularly
through 180deg as described above, to drive the ship
forward in open water, or astern in ice. Two Rolls-
Royce 1100kW thrusters are installed forward. For
harbour and emergency use, a 1080kW alternator is
provided and the whole arrangement is monitored and
controlled by CAE Valmet equipment. A Kongsberg
bridge control system is installed, and one-man
operation is included.
In support vessel mode, Fesco Sakhalin is equipped to
supply bulk liquids, powders and fuel to the Orlan
platform, and six dry bulk storage tanks supplied by
Rolls-Royce are fitted aft of the machinery space for
this purpose. Other items installed for this role include
brine, oil base mud, base oil, and cargo oil pumps,
whilst for dealing with oil spills a full outfit of Lamor
skimming and collecting equipment is also provided.

T
he 75m towing/salvage tug Fairmount Sherpa has
been built for MPC Scheepsfounds Fairmount
Sherpa BV and Fairmount Marine BV for worldwide
long distance deep-sea ocean towing. Built by Niigata
Shipbuilding & Repair, in Japan, the vessel can also
operate as an anchor handling tug with high
manoeuvrability serving offshore rigs and FPSOs. The
first job for this tug was the towing of a semi-
submersible barge, Ocean Orc, from Japan to El
Salvador.
This 3239gt vessel has been installed with four main
engines (of
3000kW each with approximately
200tonnes bollard pull) and two propeller (CP with colt
nozzle) systems which it is hoped will radically reduce
the number of accident and incident levels. All tugs in
this series of four will be powered by a complete
Wärtsilä propulsion system, comprising four Wärtsilä
32 engines, Wärtsilä gearboxes, Lips CP propellers, Lips
high efficiency nozzles, and a Lipstronic integrated
control and manoeuvring system. For economical fuel
consumption over the long distances that the tug will be
working, Fairmount Sherpa operates on heavy fuel, which
is much cheaper.
Navigation equipment is adopted for GMDSS area 3.
For wheelhouse operation, ie, towing, salvage, and
anchor-handling, there is an uninterrupted 360deg view,
especially requested by the shipowner. Accommodation
has been provided for 12 crew and 24 passengers.
Two sets of remote controlled dual foam/water
monitor (1200m3/hr each) have been installed, with the
class notation 'Fire Fighting Ship I'. An oil dispersant
system has been installed for oil pollution control.
Able to tow for 40 continuous days, the tug has not
only been classed by Lloyd's Register to +100Al Tug,
Fire-Fighting Ship 1 (2400m3/hr) with water spray,
SCM+LMC, Panama, but has certification from other

G
rampian Commander is the first of a series of seven
standby emergency response and rescue vessels to
be built by Spanish shipyard Balenciaga for owner
North Star Shipping Ltd, based in Aberdeen, Scotland.
This vessel, which is already in service, was named on
7th of September 2005. This first of series vessel was
delivered a month in advance of the contracted
delivery date.
In line with most of North Star's fleet this vessel will
be engaged in standby and emergency response and
rescue duties, primarily supporting oil rigs in the
northern sector of the North Sea, where she will spend
28 days of every month, only returning to port for crew
changes, loading fuel, stores, and spares. She is a Group
B standby rescue vessel, designed and outfitted to
rescue up to 300 people in the UK sector.
The concept design work was carried out by IMT, in
close cooperation with the ship owner's technical staff.
Grampian Commander has high freeboard and full lines
above the water line forward, for confronting heavy
weather conditions that the vessel will be subjected to in
the North Sea in winter time. The forward facing full
breadth deckhouse front on the forecastle deck offers a
large wall to shield the wheelhouse, which is located
quite far aft, from the green water in heavy sea
conditions.
As a standby vessel a crew capacity for up to 16 in
single cabins in the accommodation lay out, together
with the dedicated survivor accommodation and
treatment areas have been incorporated. To house all of
the crew, and potentially up to 300 recovered people,
the superstructure sides have been taken to the full
beam in all accommodation decks. This arrangement
has contributed to provide the crew members with
greater comfort.
Below decks the vessel is subdivided into the bow
thruster/genset compartment aft of the fore peak,
separated from the engine control room compartment
by means of a watertight remote operated hydraulic
door, the engine room aft and a engineer's workshop,
just forward of the aft peak. All of the above spaces are
flanked by wing tanks effectively forming a double hull
throughout the length of the vessel.
The vessel is driven by a single MaK 8M20 main
engine developing 1520kW whilst turning at
1000rev/min. The engine drives a Scana Volda CP
propulsion system in open water, through a flexible
coupling. Command of the engine and propeller is by
means of controls, comfortably placed on both the fore
and aft consoles in the wheelhouse, at easy reach from
the helmsman's seat.
Forward in the vessel is a Schottel SRP 170-ZSV
retractable azimuth propulsion unit, of 280kW, which
can be driven separately by a dedicated control both
forward and aft control stations, or in conjunction with
the main propeller and steering system by means of a
single joystick lever. This retractable unit provides the
vessel with a redundant means of propulsion in the
event that the main engine should suffer a serious
failure, since it can be driven by the generating sets.
When on standby duties in fair weather this retractable
thruster will be used for loitering, with the main engine
shut down. This will provide the ship with reduced fuel
consumption.
The single propeller when combined with the high lift
rudder together with the electrically driven azimuthing
bow thruster, give the ship excellent maneuverability
and necessary control for station keeping and tracking,
when centrally controlled by the Schottel 'Masterstick'
joystick system. All propulsion units can be operated by
means of their individual controls from the fore and aft
stations in the wheelhouse, as well as from the
independent joystick system provided, which has three
fixed control panels, one each on the bridge wings and
in the aft control console of the wheelhouse.
Dreggen supplied the hydraulic knuckle boom crane,
with a capacity of 2tonnes at 15m outreach. The
function of the crane as well as for the usual loading of
spares and stores and handling equipment in port, is the
deployment of the scoop over the vessel's side when
performing rescue operations.

A
new Norwegian Coastguard multi-role vessel Harstad,
built by Aker's Søviknes yard, in western Norway,
based on steelwork from Aker Tulcea in Romania was
designed by Rolls-Royce. The vessel is owned by Remøy
Shipping, who operate it on long term charter to
Kystvakten.
Harstad undertakes a variety of coastguard and EEZ
(Exclusive Economic Zone) management roles. These
include offshore standby and rescue, firefighting, salvage,
general law enforcement operations, and fishery control.
One important duty is pollution prevention. There is
concern over the rapidly increasing oil tanker traffic from
Russian ports along the coastline of northern Norway,
with the risk of a disabled vessel grounding and causing
an oil spill. Harstad is therefore fitted for emergency
towing of tankers up to about 200,000dwt and spill clean-
up. The vessel will be manned, as are other Norwegian
coastguard vessels, by a combined military and civilian
crew.
A new Rolls-Royce design, the 83m long UT512, was
developed to meet the challenging requirements. A bollard
pull of about 110tonnes is combined with a speed of
about 18.5knots to enable the vessel to reach the scene of
an incident quickly and then tow a stricken vessel to safety.
Operation along the full length of Norway's coastline
and throughout the country's exclusive economic zone
will involve much time spent in the Barent's Sea, so ICE
1B class has been specified, along with anti-icing measures
such as heated shelters for the two MOB/boarding boats.
For towing and emergency work, this UT 512 design
has TUG notation and includes an optimally located
towing winch, a reinforced pushbow, FiFi 1 firefighting
capability, a hospital, and extensive equipment including
line throwing gear, a harpoon system for attaching the tow
wire to stricken vessels, oil spill booms and skimmers, and
1000m³ of tankage for recovered oil. For its patrol boat
role it has a foredeck mounted gun and it is equipped with
fast rescue/boarding boats and a full military and civilian
communications system.
As well as the design, Rolls-Royce has provided a
complete package of equipment. The main propulsion
engines will be two 8-cylinder Bergen B32:40L diesels,
each developing 4000kW, turning Kamewa Ulstein CP
propellers in nozzles. Independent Tenfjord steering gears
operate the high lift rudders, and there are two electrically
driven thrusters at the bow. One is a 736kW Kamewa
Ulstein tunnel thruster and the other is an Ulstein
Aquamaster swing-up azimuth thruster rated at 883kW.
Fire pumps are driven from the main engines through
power take-offs.
A Rauma Brattvaag deck machinery package has been
specified, comprising a main low pressure hydraulic
towing winch with a 50tonne pull and 250tonne brake
holding load, anchor windlass, capstan, and tugger winch.
Towing pins and a hydraulic deck crane are also provided.
This coastguard vessel is the first to be fitted with the
new Rolls-Royce Poscon2 DP system (AUTS notation),
and it has a full UMAS automation system.
Accommodation is provided for up to 35 people in
single and twin berth cabins with full facilities. The
superstructure is placed near amidships to reduce
motions, and Harstad is also equipped with a passive roll
reduction system.

ighspeed 5 has recently been delivered to
Hellenic Seaways - Greece's largest domestic
ferry operator, transporting approximately six
million passengers, 200,000 trucks and 800,000 cars
every year. Highspeed 5 brings the total number of
vessels in the Hellenic Seaways fleet to 34.
In keeping with the stern-to-mooring style
commonly used in Greece, the vessel has been
customised to provide separate passenger and
vehicle loading ramps. The bi-fold ramps enable
loading and unloading onto a low landing stage and
the ferry will be equipped with high speed anchor
winches and mooring winches to allow for efficient
berthing.
Following on from Austal's experience in the build
of the 92m Highspeed 4, the new catamaran capable
of travelling in excess of 40knots has three classes
of seating (VIP, business, and economy) each with
its own bar and facilities. With capacity for 154 cars
(or four coaches and 131 cars) and 809 passengers,
the vessel will display a sophisticated level of fit out,
disabled persons access (including a lift) in
compliance with European Union regulations and
crew accommodation for 26.
The boarding area will lead to a baggage room on
the mezzanine deck and, for the comfort of
passengers when boarding, dry exhaust funnels have
been designed to direct main engine exhaust fumes
away from the ramps and other passenger areas.
Interestingly, eight especially designed dog kennels
have been provided based on a special Presidential
Decree allowing their transport on a high speed
ferry. Built in differing sizes for optimum comfort
each kennel has a vacuum sanitary connection
plumbed to the vessel's black water system.

T
he first of the Armidale Class patrol boats
arrived in Darwin, Australia, in May where it
completed the final stage of its mission trial. During
trials it became evident that HMAS Armidale's
performance was greater than that specified in the
contract and the vessel was able to deliver a speed
margin of 2knots above the original specification.
The Armidale Class boats have been designed to
operate without re-supply for up to six weeks but are
equipped for replenishment at sea. This includes
transferring people and light cargo between the boat
and helicopters and provision for refuelling from a
supply vessel. The onboard fuel capacity provides a
steaming range in excess of 3000nm, a 20% increase
over the RAN's existing patrol vessels.
With an unmanned engine room, large galley and
shared cabins with private ensuite bathroom and
heads, the amenities have provided the Navy's 21st
century sailors with high quality functional
accommodation suitable for their expected 21-day
missions when in service.
The vessel incorporates a number of innovative
features that maximise its functionality, including a
state-of-the-art bridge layout with computer assisted
navigation facilities, radar and communication
systems, and advanced weapons control capabilities.
Boarding party operations will be significantly helped
through having a dedicated room for readying and
deploying boarding parties.
In addition to their important civil roles, the patrol
boats will enhance the RAN's capacity to protect
Australia's harbours and interdict suspicious shipping
in that country' extensive ocean approaches. Their
primary weapon system is the Rafael Typhoon MK
25,
which is fitted with a marinised 25mm
Bushmaster cannon. Two 12.7mm machine guns are
also fitted.

T
he new offshore raiding/replenishment/rescue/
recovery craft built by Halmatic has been
designed as a multi-role fast raiding craft with ro-ro
capability. It is a fast, agile, mission-focussed small
craft capable of operations in both blue water and
green river environments.
According to Halmatic, it effectively bridges the
gap between large offshore craft and small riverine
craft. It remains upright when beached, has a load
carrying capability, which is significantly larger than
comparable craft, and provides a large clear deck
with a ro-ro loading capability (bow and stern
ramps).
Powered by twin Yanmar diesel engines coupled
to Hamilton water jets it is capable of a speed in
excess of 35knots in full loaded condition. The twin
engines and waterjets are entirely independent of
each other to maximise safety and redundancy.
The craft features a rapidly reconfigurable deck
layout, which can be quickly reconfigured to meet
changing mission requirements and a unique new
hull form. The vessel has been designed with a large
clear deck area, and all deck fittings, such as
consoles and seats are modular.
Its primary roles are: littoral movement of men,
all terrain vehicles (ATV's) and equipment 
from blue to green water environments, rapid
deployment/recovery 
of
men,
ATV's 
and
equipment from either bow or stern ramps, riverine
operations, force protection with up to five crew
served, and high speed logistical support to
humanitarian missions (such as UN operations,
flood relief, etc).
HORC reportedly has excellent seakeeping in all
conditions and can remain upright on a beach or
flat surface. Its top speed in fully loaded conditions
is in excess of 35knots, and the vessel also possesses
a high payload capability, which is in excess of
2tonnes. The vessel is unsinkable in the full load
condition.

T
he first of three new crew boats were delivered to
Kanoo Marine (a division of Kanoo Shipping
Agencies) after successful sea trials at Damens'
shipyard in Gorinchem. The first-of-class vessel,
named Kanoo 30, then sailed to the Gulf in April and
shortly after began service. The second vessel left the
shipyard the same month, and the third underwent
trials in June.
Kanoo Shipping Agencies (part of Yusuf Bin
Ahmed Kanoo) has bought a number of vessels from
Damen in the past. The company provides among
others a network of ship agency's services throughout
the Gulf, with fast crew boats operating out of Ras
Tanura and Juaymah (Saudi Arabia) and Fujairah
(United Arab Emirates).
The new crew boats are based on the standard
Damen Stan Tender 1905 design, of which three
vessels are in operation with other owners. The version
developed for Kanoo can carry six passengers, and three
crew, as well as a payload of 2.5tonnes, whilst
maintaining a speed of 18knots. The vessels' main
purpose will be to transfer ships' crews and officials, as
well as stores and spares.
Kanoo 30, and her sisters Kanoo 31 and Kanoo 32, are
19.15m overall, have a beam overall of 5.30m, are
2.70m deep at the sides, and have a maximum draught
of 1.60m. They have been classed by the American
Bureau of Shipping to: A1, HSC Crew supply, Coastal
waters, Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, AMS
(without Cross).
A great deal of thought was put into developing the
arrangement of the boats, according to Damen. The
layout now provides passengers and crew with greater
comfort during passage and ensures maximum safety
during crew transfer operations. The vessels also have
all-round visibility for passengers, a powerful air
conditioning system,
and an integrated safety
instruction DVD system, etc.
The design philosophy to optimise for reliability and
durability has further resulted in an oversized engine
cooling capacity, redundant engine room ventilation
with dust filters and redundant water-cooled air
conditioning; all optimised on the basis of Kanoo's and
Damen's experience with Gulf conditions.
Kanoo 30 has been equipped with two caterpillar
3412D-TTA main engines, which have a total power of
1264bkW at 1800rev/min, giving a top speed of
18knots. Two Reintjes WVS 430/1 gearboxes, and two
FP propellers have also been supplied.
The vessels have been supplied with a 10-man
SOLAS type-approved liferaft, along with three
lifebuoys, and nine lifejackets. Surveillance equipment
includes a 250W, 24V searchlight.
As expected in a vessel of this caliber, Kanoo 30 has
been equipped with communication equipment that
includes a Ritchie compass, an echosounder from
Raymarine, and VHF from Sailor, and the radar and
GPS have been supplied by Furuno.

T
he new 82m ro-pax vessel Lora D'Abundo, built by
Rodriquez Cantieri Navali for the shipping company
Medmar, was delivered to the Port of Naplese at the
beginning of March.
This ship has been designed to
increase the 'sea highway development' with a new link
between Naples and Ischia Island, with three sailings per
day in each direction.
Lora D'Abundo was built entirely of steel and is the first
ro-pax ferry that Rodriquez Cantieri Navali has ever built.
At 82m long, she has a beam of 15m, and a depth of
14.90m. Deadweight is 604tonnes.
The vessel's hull was built in Romania in close
cooperation with the Aker Braila shipyard, and was sent to
Rodriquez' Messina yard for final outfitting. Three more
sister vessels will be delivered at a later date. The total
contract for all the vessels is worth around €60 million.
The ro-pax has been installed with two Caterpillar
diesel engines, with an output of
2700kW at
1000rev/min giving an 18knot cruising speed. Two CP
propellers have also been fitted. The propulsion, based
on two medium speed diesel engines each connected to
the CP propellers, via a speed reducing gearbox, is a well
proven and economic system.
Lora D'Abundo, model name TRF 82, is equipped with
a hoistable car deck to increase the loading flexibility
between cars and trucks. There is capacity for 895
passengers and 140 cars.
The monitoring and stabilisation system has been
entirely supplied by Rodriquez Marine System, a wholly
owned division of Rodriquez Cantieri Navali SpA. The
system has been custom designed with the specific
route conditions taken into account. The ride control
system has a fully active centrally PLC controlled
system, and has a fast response time because of the use
of moveable flaps in combination with trim tabs. There
is no impact on vessel speed.

he Austal-built 67m high speed vehicle-
passenger catamaran, Maria Dolores, for Virtu
Ferries, of Malta, has the capacity to carry 600
passengers and 65 cars, or 95lane metres of trucks
plus 35 cars.
Established in 1988 Virtu Ferries operates fast
ferry services between Malta and Sicily. This new
vessel will operate on routes from Valletta to
Catania, Licata and Pozzallo. Designed specifically
for this route, with aft and side ramps for rapid
turnaround, the ferry will greatly expand the service
to mainland Italy.
The ferry is powered by six MTU 16 cylinder
diesel engines driving a Kamewa propulsion system
through six ZF gearboxes. Maria Dolores has a
maximum deadweight of 260tonnes and will operate
loaded at a speed of 35knots providing a year-round
schedule catering for car traffic and the
import/export of cargo.
The vehicle deck on the new ferry will offer a
clear height of 4.6m allowing for shipment of
campers and coaches, a niche market hitherto
untapped by Malta. Europe is experiencing an
unprecedented increase in coach travel, with
hundreds of thousands of coach tourists across the
continent each year and increasing numbers taking
advantage of reduced rates in off-peak times in
southern Europe. The new vessel will ensure Malta
is seen as extension of mainland Europe following
its accession to the EU on 1 May 2004.
Passenger accommodation will be located on two
decks: the tourist class upper deck for 508
passengers also provides two catering outlets, two
shops and recreational facilities. The bridge deck
will accommodates 92 club class passengers, with
outside seats also available. The spacious seating
configuration on both decks has been designed to
allow for ease of circulation of passengers.
The vessel is being built in accordance with the
requirements, and under the survey, of the Det
Norske Veritas,
conforming to International
Maritime Organisation codes and Malta Flag State
and Italian Port State Regulations. Registration will
be under the Malta Flag.

n October, Foss Maritime took delivery of the
powerful new harbour tug Morgan Foss for service in
Pacific Coast ports. This high-powered 'compact' tug is
the result of a unique collaboration between the owner,
designer, and builder.
Morgan Foss is the second in the new series of
designated Dolphin class tugs for Foss, designed by
Robert Allan Ltd in collaboration with Foss' in-house
engineering staff, and built in its own shipyard in
Rainier, Oregon, USA.
The design incorporates a small number of
refinements from a prototype tug, Mikioi delivered in
1994, based on the operational feedback from crews.
The tug is configured strictly as a high-performance
day-boat, with a very compact wheelhouse atop a
similarly compact deckhouse which contains only the
engine exhaust casings, vent intakes, and a small day-
room and lavatory for the crew.
In addition to the overall contract design package,
Robert Allan Ltd was also tasked with producing the
complete production engineering package for the
shipyard. A complete 3D steel product model for this
series of tugs was developed in ShipConstructor
software, and used for NC cutting of all steel parts.
Morgan Foss has a length overall of 23.77m, a moulded
beam of 10.3m, a moulded depth of 3.6m, hull draught
amidship is 2.4m, and the maximum draught is 4.5m.
The forward deck machinery on the tug is an all-
electric hawser winch, designed and built by Markey
Machinery, of Seattle. Designated as a Model DEPCF-
48, the winch carries 182.8m of 20cm circumference
Spectra/Plasma line, with a breaking strain of
500,000lbs. The towline leads forward through a U-
shaped heavy duty towing staple with a polished inside
face.
Fendering comprises a heavy cylindrical bow fender,
located above a belt of Schuyler 'Soft-Loop' style fender
that extends around the full perimeter of the tug at the
main sheer line.
The main engines are a pair of Caterpillar 3512D
diesels, each rated 2365bhp at 1800rev/min. These each
drive a Rolls-Royce model US 205 Z-drive unit, with
2400mm diameter four-bladed propellers. The drive-
line comprises a hollow carbon-fibre shaft, enabling the
complete elimination of
any intermediate shaft
bearings. The main engines are resiliently mounted on
flexible mounts.
Electrical power is provided by a pair of Mitsubishi
6D16-T diesel gensets,
each rated 125kW at
1800rev/min. Power output is 460v/3 phase/60Hz.

A
F Theriault & Son Ltd of Meteghan River, Nova
Scotia, this year delivered the 20m RAven 2000
class, aluminium patrol catamaran Murray to the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Marine Division,
for service in the harsh coastal waters of Canada's
Atlantic Coast in February.
The vessel was designed by Robert Allan Ltd, naval
architects of Vancouver, Canada, and is the latest in the
series of RAven class catamarans that began in 1991
with the construction of three 18m catamarans for
RCMP service on Canada's West Coast. These deliveries
were followed by the 20m Inkster in 1995, and another
18m catamaran for the east coast in 1994.
Murray has a 19.75m length overall, a beam moulded
of 6.70m, a depth, moulded of 2.00m, a maximum load
draught of 0.77m, and a range of 500nm. The vessel
has been classed by Transport Canada, Home Trade III.
Of
all-welded aluminium construction, Murray
represents the latest generation of
this high-
performance patrol vessel type. The most notable
difference between this boat and her predecessors is the
addition of a complete upper deck level in which the
fully enclosed wheelhouse is located. This arrangement
creates better visibility for the crew, and also creates
much needed additional accommodation space on the
main deck.
The vessel has a straightforward configuration with
the elevated wheelhouse providing excellent visibility
both forward and aft, full accommodation for a crew of
four, with galley, mess and washroom facilities on the
main deck. The main features of the working deck
include a fast rescue/response rigid-hull inflatable boat
on a launch/recovery ramp centred on the aft deck.
Propulsion of Murray is by a twin diesel-driven
surface-piercing propeller arrangement. The main
engines are Caterpillar model C18 diesels, each rated
1000bhp at 2300rev/min, driving Arneson Model ASD-
12 surface drives. This system provides the vessel with a
comfortable cruising speed of 25knots.

S
panish towage company Remolcadores de Puerto y
Altura SA, REPASA, took delivery of Romulo and
Remo a pair of ocean going ASD tugs built at Astilleros
Balenciaga, Northern Spain. It is claimed that these
83tonnes bollard pull tugs will be the two most
powerful vessels of this type yet in Spain.
This pair of multi-purpose tugs are capable of
performing towing operations, fire fighting, have
pollution prevention and oil recovery capabilities, and
can lift offshore discharge buoys for maintenance,
carrying 20ft containers, and performing anchor
handling duties.
The design of Romulo and Remo was undertaken by
Spanish design company Cintranaval. The entire
structure is made from steel, including the wheelhouse.
The hull lines are characteristic of a tug of this type,
with a slightly raked bow profile which extends
vertically down below the waterline to provide
additional lateral area resistance to assist in the balance
of forces when performing escort duties. This solid
plate joins a deep box-shaped keel which runs the
whole length of the vessel terminating aft in a
streamlined skeg.
Accommodation, for up to seven crew, is provided
with air conditioning by means of fan coils, thus
allowing temperature control in each individual space.
At main deck level, two individual cabins, the galley,
mess/day room, office and communal wash room are
sited. Below this deck there is a three-man cabin, a large
store area, laundry and access to the engine control
room. The latter is on a tween deck in the forward end
of the engine room, below which some of the engine
room equipment is fitted.
Above is the boat deck with en-suite cabins for the
captain and chief engineer. The wheelhouse, as is
common tug practice, is designed for all-round
visibility, with windows down to floor level. In this
respect, the exhaust stacks stop short of
the
wheelhouse floor level, with only the exhaust pipes and
fire fighting piping running to the wheelhouse roof
level, thus minimising the obstruction to vision from
the steering position.

T
he steel and aluminium constructed vessel, SAR
413, made for search and rescue operations, is the
last of six of a series for Vinamarine, the Vietnam
National Maritime Bureau. This 42m craft was built
under license from a prefabricated shipbuilding kit
supplied by Damen Technical Cooperation by Song
Cam Shipyard, Hai Phong, Vietnam. This involved
shipping components from The Netherlands and using
the local labour force for construction.
SAR 413 has been put to work in the southern coastal
areas of Vietnam, the southern port of Vung Tau, and,
like her sisters, so far the vessel has been successful in
the rescue of sailors, fishing vessels, etc.
The ship was handed over to Vinamarine in the
presence of the vice minister of transportation, the
chairman of Vinamarine, and the Ambassador of The
Netherlands, as well as representatives of Vinamarine,
Damen and local industries. Handing over took place in
the port of Haiphong. SAR 413 and her sisters took a
total of 34 months to build. Each vessel was delivered
according to schedule.
SAR 413 is a member of the Damen Stan Patrol
series and has an overall length of 43.8m, with a beam
of 7m, a depth of 3.77m, and a maximum speed of
26knots. She has been classified by Lloyd's Register to
100 A1, SSC, Mono, HSC, G5, LMC (without cross).
Propulsion is via two MTU engines, with an output of
2320bkW at 2000rev/min. The vessel has also been
fitted with two gearboxes, supplied by Reintjes. Two FP
propellers have also been installed, with a diameter of
1500mm each.
As expected, the vessel is provided with all modern
satellite communication and navigational aids, including
Furuno radars, GMDSS, and Echosounder, and C Plath
pilot autopilot, compass, and gyro, and a Jotron
VHF/AM receiver.
Air-conditioned service and living spaces have been
provided for 14 crew and 34 survivors consisting of
seven cabins (one x four-person, four x two person
crew, two x one-person crew with spare bunk). Also
built was a sick bay for 12 persons, including medical
facilities, and a survivor room. As expected there are
also stores, galley, mess/dayroom, wheelhouse, and
sanitary spaces.

T
he 79.9m Sea Fighter was christened on the 5
February 2005 and launched on the 12 February.
This vessel is the first of a new class of ships FSF-1 or
Fast Sea Frame. The ship is the first purpose built high
speed catamaran for the US Navy. Sea Fighter is both
the largest and fastest catamaran ever built in the USA.
The Office of Naval Research procured Sea Fighter
through TITAN Corp. Nichols Brothers Boatbuilders,
in Washington State, USA, built the vessel. BMT Nigel
Gee and Associates were responsible for the complete
design from concept through to detailed design of the
vessel.
Sea Fighter is capable of speeds in excess of 50knots
with 500tonnes of deadweight. When operating in
diesel mode the vessel has a range of in excess of
4000nm at 20knots. The vessel has been equipped with
two types of main engine, that is two GE gas turbines
and two MTU diesels models LM2500 and 16V 595
TE90, with an output of 22380kW and 4320kW
respectively. Four Kamewa 125 SII waterjets have also
been put onboard.
Sea Fighter has a two spot Class 2A flight deck, and
will be a technology demonstrator for night vision
device compatible lighting for both the US Navy and
US Coastguard. She has been classed by the American
Bureau of Shipping to ABS A1 HSC Naval Craft OE,
AMS, R2-S, and by the IMO as HSC 2000 Cargo Vessel.
The vessel has been configured as a multi-mission
ship. The large air conditioned mission bay provides
dedicated locations for up to 12 16tonne mission
modules. At each location a resource panel is provided
to supply electrical power, chilled water and a LAN
connection. The mission modules allow the vessel to be
configured for multiple roles, for example ASW, MCM,
and anti small boat swarming.
Sea Fighter has a unique stern ramp for the launch and
recovery of small boats and underwater vehicles from
the sea whilst underway. Cargo handling is via an X Y
Crane which is capable of moving 16tonne mission
modules around the mission bay. A lift provides the
cargo link between the flight deck and mission deck.

T
he 8.85m harbour tug Sea Helper was the first vessel
of its class to be designed by Macduff Ship Design.
Aberdeenshire Council,
Scotland,
commissioned
Macduff
Ship Design to produce the design,
contract/tender information, and to act as the owner's
project managers throughout the contract period.
For operation in Macduff harbour, this versatile craft
was built by Coastal Marine Boatbuilders, in Eyemouth,
who delivered on time and on budget, using a full
Macduff supplied kit, which eased fabrication.
Sea Helper has an overall hull length of 8.85m, with
length over fenders of 9.25m, her breadth moulded is
3.70m, while depth moulded is 1.75m, and the
maximum draught aft is 1.50m. Fuel capacity is
1000litres.
Of all steel construction, the vessel was surveyed by
the Society of Consulting Marine Engineers and Ship
Surveyors, and issued with an MCA Category 3 Area of
Operation Workboat Certificate.
Designed as a harbour tug/workboat with a pilot
endorsement, her primary roles will be towage and
manoeuvring of vessels within the harbour, assisting in
the slipping of vessels, survey work in local council
owned harbours and occasional pilot duties for visiting
commercial coasters.
Ease of handling (by a crew of two) and good levels
of manoeuvrability were key factors in the design stage.
Fitted with a high performance aerofoil rudder,
operated by Groveready - Wills Ridley steering gear, she
is able to execute tight turning circles and displays a
quick response time from hard over to hard over.
The main engine is a Mitsubishi 6D16 rated at 120bhp
at 2000rev/min and in this application de-rated to
103hp at 1800rev/min. The engine is fresh water keel
cooled with heavy duty steel channels welded to the
hull.
Close coupled to a PRM 1000 D3 gearbox with a ratio
of 2.86:1 the main engine and gearbox sit on a steel
frame flexibly mounted to the main engine seats,
thereby reducing noise and vibration levels and
enhancing the operators working environment.
A
750mm diameter three-blade NiAl bronze propeller is
swung, surrounded by a heavy duty tubular prop guard
for protection of the propeller and persons in the water.
The propeller shaft is fitted with a rope cutter for added
protection. With this rating the vessel managed an
average speed of 8.0knots on her delivery trip from
Eyemouth to Macduff.
Driven off a clutched PTO on the gearbox is the
hydraulic pump for the Rotzler Titan TH2 towing
winch. With full control from the wheelhouse this
winch has a line pull of 1.4 tonnes and a capacity of
40m of 10mm wire and an emergency brake release.
The winch is worked in conjunction with a heavy duty
H bollard mounted on the aft deck.
The wheelhouse is fitted out for two crew members
and one pilot and has basic electronic equipment
comprising an Icom M503 VHF.
Simrad HT50
portable VHF, Furuno M1623 radar and Furuno
LS6100 echosounder.
Electrics are 24v DC throughout with a main engine
driven Lucas 120 amp 24v DC alternator, a set of heavy
duty engine room batteries and an emergency set of
batteries in the wheelhouse.
A powered bilge/fire
pump is fitted, driven off the main engine and a hand
bilge pump also serves the engine room.
Great attention has been given to the design of the
hull, bulwarks and fendering to ensure smoothness,
robustness and ease of operation while working close to
other vessels and in awkward corners of the harbour.
Heavy duty rubber 'D' fendering is fitted right around
the vessel at main deck level comprising 152mm x
152mm section with a further vertical rubber bow
pusher fitted of 250mm x 250mm section. The deck is
clear and free of obstructions and the engine room
escape hatch is a flush Hercules hatch on a coaming.
The design has proved ideal for the confines of a
working harbour and in addition has exhibited good sea
keeping properties in the open sea so should prove a
capable all round working platform.

H
ong Kong Salvage and Towage's three latest
vessels, Shatin, Ting Kau, and Yuen Kok, which were
delivered in February and March 2005, are the first of
the company's fleet to have been built by Cheoy Lee
Ltd/Hin Lee (Zhuhai) Shipyard Co Ltd, based in Hong
Kong and China. These tugs will increase the fleet size
to 25, of which 13 tugs are based in Hong Kong.
With the increasing size of container vessels calling in
Hong Kong these tugs are designed to meet Hong
Kong harbour's future requirements. With 4000bhp
and an expected bollard pull of over 50tonnes they will
be a worthy addition to the harbour fleet.
The new tugs are based on the previous Sha Chau
coastal class, having a length of 29m and a beam of
9.5m, with maximum draught of 3.81m, and designed
to be operated as three-man harbour tugs. The internal
design including the accommodation is similar to the
earlier class, while the only external difference is the
removal of the aft winch, which has been replaced by a
towing hook. Kitagawa Kogyo has provided the deck
machinery and the forward winch is fitted with 110m
of 96mm Supermix rope.
Propulsion is via two Niigata 6L26HLX engines, with
an output of 2000hp at 750rev/min, with Omega
clutches and ZP-31 Z drive propulsion units. This gives
a maximum speed of 13.07knots, a bollard pull of over
50tonnes, and a range of 3500miles.

S
irocco is a first of class new build South Catamaran
42/13m Alloy WFSV (wind farm service vessel) for
Danbrit Ship Management Ltd, of Grimsby. The vessel is
currently working on the Kentish Flats Wind Farm,
operating from Whitstable, North Kent.
The vessel follows standard South Boats design
principles with symmetrical underwater sections and
asymmetrical wet deck knuckles and spray deflectors. The
design features include a high buoyancy bow, triple internal
spray knuckles to maintain a suspension of air/water to
dampen pitching moments particularly in heavy weather.
In addition the hulls maintain a parallel waterline beam
through the length of the vessel allowing good weight
distribution around the vessel. The hull is not simply a
scaled up variant of the 11m hull but an individual design
in keeping with the family design.
The vessel is fabricated with Lloyd's Register-approved
aluminium sheet and sections from 4mm to 15mm, to
meet Lloyd's Special Service Craft Rules. Fabrication and
welding practices have been adopted from substantially
larger vessels to maximise the strength and rigidity of the
structure.
All frames and joints are fabricated with stress relieving
slots and all shell plating is welded with chine and rider bars
to maximise weld strength and vessel longevity. All hull
transitions are fitted with a welded aluminium flange
insulated from stainless steel flanges and stainless steel skin
fittings to all Lloyd's approved hoses.
The vessel measures 14.4m length overall, has 13m hull,
with a 6.1m breadth overall, a 0.9m draught, and 17,500kg
displacement. Sirocco has a central island wheelhouse
format with 60m2 of working deck area split equally
between forward and after deck areas.
On deck the vessel is fitted with forward and after flood
lights, side deck recessed lighting, secondary vessel
controls, a Palfinger PK4501M hydraulic fully folding
2tonne deck crane. Access to the turbine is via a boarding
platform forward over a central knuckle.
The wheelhouse is fitted with 12 individual KAB214
crew seats on plinths for individual stowage of personal
and safety equipments. Seats are arranged with seven units
to starboard and five units to port. The central helm is
fitted with a full width aluminium console with a full
Furuno suite of electronics. The helm seat is a KAB301K
on a plinth with all controls within easy reach. Central is a
Kobelt electronic star wheel, to port is a Kobelt 6505
throttle head and to starboard is a Kobelt bucket control
head.
The vessel is fitted with a sophisticated bucket control
system designed between Ultra Dynamics Ltd and Kobelt
allowing the vessel to be helmed from two stations with
star wheel or joystick control of the system or each bucket
can be steered independently using twin joysticks to toe the

rving Shipbuilding Inc, of Canada, this September
completed a Robert Allan-designed ASD 33/55 ice
classed tug, Stevns Arctic, for Partrederiet Stevns, of
Denmark. The 33.5m tug was designed for both ship
assist and ocean towing duties.
The hull was built in Quebec, then towed to Irving's
yard in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where it was taken into
the yard's undercover facilities for outfitting.
Designed to handle a range of duties including ship
assist, coastal towing, rig support and escort work, the
Robert Allan designed vessel meets the stringent
requirements of the Danish Maritime Authority and
has been classed to Lloyd's Register, +100A1 Tug, Ice
Class 1B, +LMC, UMS.
Stevns Arctic has a length of 33.5m, a moulded
breadth of 11.6m, and a 5.20m draught. The tug is
powered by a pair of MAK 6M25 diesels, each
developing 1850kW at 750rev/min. Rolls-Royce
Aquamaster US255 Z drives with CP propellers have
been installed, and provide a bollard pull of about
65tonnes. The vessel has a top speed of 13.5knots.
To provide maximum flexibility, the tug is also
equipped with a Rolls-Royce Kamewa 300kW CP bow
thruster. Auxiliary power is provided by two 200kW
Volvo Penta TAMD 103A gensets and one Volvo Penta
TAMD 74C 100kW harbour set installed in an
acoustical enclosure.
For towing and anchor-handling operations, a set of
60tonne towpins have been installed in conjunction
with a 70tonne towhook and stern roller. The
frequency-controlled aft winch is a single drum type
complete with spooling gear supplied by Rolls-Royce.
The frequency-controlled forward winch also supplied
by Rolls-Royce is a split-drum type, with two cable
lifters and two warping ends.
Comfortable accommodations for eight crew has
been provided, with four single cabins and two double
cabins.

T
ees Navigator is a Wildcat 12m catamaran built by
Safehaven Marine for PD Teesport, based in
Middlesborough, UK. The port decided to build a
catamaran instead of a monohull craft due to the use
of a new multi beam sonar head; on a catamaran the
sonar head is deployed through a moon pool in the
bridge deck, which is much safer.
The Wildcat was chosen after a demonstration run in
Ireland in rough weather where her seakeeping was
good, especially directional stability, a very important
consideration for a craft whose main task is to steer a
dead straight line during data acquisition. The Wildcat
was capable of maintaining course, virtually without
helm correction in a quartering following sea in force
5-6 conditions, which would not have been possible on
a monohull. Furthermore the greatly reduced rolling
of the craft meant the accuracy of data acquisition was
invariably much higher than would be possible on a
monohull.
The vessel's based on a motor yacht superstructure
providing a large accommodation area yet still
maintaining a good working space in the aft cockpit.
The vessel's general arrangement consists of a fully
equipped galley in the port hull, and a berth positioned
over the bridge deck. The heads and a second berth are
in the starboard hull. The main cabin has a central twin
seat helm position, and an ergonomically designed
helm position.
One of the design criteria was to provide a fatigue-
free driving position. To this end a special moulding
was built allowing the helmsman to sit upright in a car
like driving position, avoiding the usual 'hunched over
the wheel' back ache inducing helm positions. Power
steering gives literally, 'finger light' steering with low
revolution lock to lock.
Survey data acquisition is carried out from a large 'L'
shaped work bench with computer racking provided
below.
Electronics include Single beam Reson
surveying equipment, Furuno Nav Net 2 black box
radar and a range of data recording hardware. Multiple
240v power outlets are provide below and supplied by
a low revving 1500rev/min, 6.5kva Generator supplied
by HFL. A four-person dinette is positioned to port
and Tees Navigator's wide beam results in a very
spacious feeling to the whole craft.
Environment comfort is maintained by a 3600BTU
air conditioning unit providing a dry, moisture free
environment without 'misting' of the windows. H/D
fendering allows the craft to carry out light pilot duties,
whilst the very high standard of fit out allows VIP
passenger duties as well.
Tees Navigator's main duty will be the very accurate
surveying of the River Tees waters serving the ports of
Tees and Hartlepool. This is one of the UK's largest
commercial port operators, and handles a high volume
of commercial traffic with up to 1200 ship movements
per 
month,
and 
handling 
vessels 
up 
to
180,000tonnes/310m in length. The quality of
surveying data is critical as often there is only 0.9m
underkeel clearance on larger vessels.
The vessel has been built with a moon pool
positioned close the LCG in the bridge deck. A large
hatch is lifted and allows the multi beam sonar head to
be deployed to below the keel line allowing data
acquisition to be carried out at speeds up to 10knots.
The valuable sonar head is fully protected by the twin
hulls making it much less vulnerable to damage than is
the case when hung over the side or bow as is the
practice on monohulls. The sonar head is then raised
the moon pool hatch close for a fast transit speeds of
20knots.
Propulsion is provided by twin Scania DI9 engines
with power of at 318hp each. These Scania engines
were chosen for their low revolution, long hour
durability, aided by their unique piston ring design,
reducing carbon build up at low rev/min which can be
a problem on other turbo engines running at
prolonged low rpm. A long range is provided by
250gallon capacity fuel tanks.
Other features on the craft are dual helm positions,
the second being from the craft's flybridge. MOB
recovery and deployment of
additional data
acquisition equipment is provided by an 'A' frame
positioned on the transom. Twin stainless steel dive
platforms give easy close access to the waterline. And
finally the vessels sleek and graceful lines make her
very attractive on the water, discarding the usual square
and boxy lines found on small catamarans to produce
one of the nicest looking commercial catamarans
available.

n late February the high performance AVT escort tug
Velox was delivered from Astilleros Gondan, of
Spain, to Østensjø Rederi AS of Haugesund, Norway.
Velox is the first of two tugs being built at Gondan to
this new design, designated as the AVT 37/65-E Class.
The design was developed by Robert Allan Ltd of
Vancouver, BC working in close association with the
Østensjø Rederi AS technical representative, Carl Johan
Amundsen of Carl J Amundsen AS, of Haugesund,
Norway, and with Voith hiffstechnik.
Velox will be used in the Norsk Hydro oil terminal
port of Sture, Norway, to provide a significant upgrade
in tanker escort capability for ships calling there. The
tug is built to DNV notation DNV a 1A1, Tug, E0,
Oilrec, Fi-Fi 1, Escort (130,10) as well as to the
requirements of the Norwegian Maritime Authority.
The new design of this vessel incorporates a number
of refinements in hull form, deck gear and skeg design
to maximise indirect towing performance. This
combination marks Velox as one of the most effective
escort tugs afloat, in terms of performance per unit
power or performance per size.
The vessel has a length overall of 37.00m, a moulded
beam of 14.00m, a moulded depth of 5.40m, and a
maximum draught of 6.90m.
Propulsion comprises a pair of Rolls-Royce/Bergen
Diesel C25:33L8P diesel engines, each rated 2400kW
at 1000rev/min, driving a Voith Model 32R6-210-2
cycloidal propeller through a Voith Turbo coupling.
This combination delivers a bollard pull of 65tonnes,
and provides a free running speed in excess of
14.5knots.
Velox is outfitted for a crew of up to six persons. All
cabins but one include private en suite facilities. There
is a spacious lounge/mess area, a fully equipped
modern galley, and a full ship's office/meeting room.
Below decks are ample stores spaces and a
fitness/exercise room.
The main towing winch is a double drum, hydraulic
winch supplied by Karmøy Winch AS. One drum is set
up for escort operations, with capacity of 350m of
92mm diameter synthetic hawser. The other drum is set
up for towing, with capacity of 1000m of 57mm
diameter SWR. The brake capacity is 300tonnes. The
winch is set up to meet DNV's escort towing
requirements, with a hydraulic render/recover feature.
The towing staple on Velox is very unusual. Designed
to accommodate both steel wire and synthetic line, it
was clearly necessary to have two distinct apertures
which would function effectively in both escort and
towing functions.
The result is a very wide-based channel slot for the
escort hawser operations, with a central fairlead above
for towing wire operations. The hawser slot permits the
line to migrate far outboard towards the pressure side
in an indirect operation, thus reducing the heeling
moment on the tug and increasing the line tension
capacity.
This combination of features gives Velox an indirect
steering force capability of 150tonnes at 10knots and
130tonnes at 10knots within the special requirements
of the DNV escort class notation.
The skeg geometry of the vessel is the result of an
extensive series of investigations into shapes and
appendages which would enable a significant increase
in indirect steering force. A wide variety of options
were explored, and their merits in terms of lifting force
and complexity were evaluated.
The final skeg configuration incorporates a refined
profile offering better lift generation than typical
NACA profiles and, most critically, incorporates the
first application of the Voith 'Turbo-Fin' rotating
cylinder at the leading edge to maximise lift in the skeg
when operating in indirect mode.
