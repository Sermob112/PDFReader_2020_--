A
dams Challenge is the latest delivery from Balenciaga, 
and the fourth vessel built for the same owner, 
Adams Offshore (UK) Ltd. Adams Challenge is also 
Balenciaga’s largest and most complex delivery for the 
offshore support vessel market, a field in which the 
shipyard has been gaining a strong foothold over the 
last decade.
As for the previous ships built for this ship owner, the 
Adams Challenge will be engaged in underwater 
surveying, pipeline construction and maintenance tasks 
by means of divers as well as the use of ROV. In 
addition, the Adams Challenge is fitted with a 12-man 
saturated diving system which will enable works to be 
carried out up to a water depth of 300m.
The concept design came from Balenciaga’s in-house 
naval architect, with the remaining design work developed 
by Cintranaval, in close cooperation with the owner.
Points of note in the vessel design are its low freeboard 
of the main deck, to facilitate the immersion and 
retrieval of divers when air diving, and also the high 
superstructure to house the large number of crew that 
she is designed to accommodate in comfort, as well as 
the Survey rooms typically found on a diving and survey 
vessel. Other outstanding features include the large sub-
sea crane, the A-frame aft and not least the helideck 
above the wheelhouse forward.
The hull lines forward are sharpened to end in a 
quasi-submerged bulbous bow for improved running 
economy over the long haul trips. The stern is of the 
transom type to afford the largest possible working deck 
area, and there is a removable stern gate for performing 
works over the stern.
Adams Challenge has been equipped to dynamic 
positioning 2 (DPS2) standard and has been equipped 
with a Kongsberg Simrad SDP21 Dynamic Position 
System interfaced with a cJoy independent joystick. The 
equipment fitted includes the following external 
position reference systems: two taut wire systems, two 
DGPS, a Fanbeam laser and one HiPap 500 and one 
HiPap350 hydro-acoustic systems.
The majority of the pumps fitted on the vessel have 
been manufactured by Bombas Azcue. The vessel is also 
capable of performing small supply tasks of water cargo 
for which a dedicated pump has been fitted. 
In water depths greater than 50m the working time on 
the bottom is greatly reduced, and decompression times 
of the divers using surface air techniques become 
prohibitively long. To exacerbate the problem air becomes 
narcotic at depth. To counteract these restrictions, 
continuous diving operations at depth are possible 
utilising a 12-man saturation diving system using mixed 
gas. This enables safe underwater work to be performed 
continuously 24 hours per day up to a depth of 300m.
Twelve divers are housed under pressure in the living 
quarters, where they eat and sleep, in two interlinked 
decompression chambers located on the deck of the 
vessel. After transferring to the diving bell a team of 
three divers are lowered to working depth through the 
vessel moonpool, and rotate working in the water for up 
to an eight hour shift. The bell returns to the surface 
and locks onto the surface system every eight hours, and 
the divers change out for a fresh team. The divers 
remain under pressure throughout and only decompress 
to atmospheric pressure at the end of a 28-day period. 
In the event of a major emergency the saturation 
system is also fitted with a hyperbaric rescue craft, 
which allows for the divers to be removed from the 
vessel, while still under pressure, if the vessel is in threat 
of sinking. After transferring to the rescue craft it can be 
lowered with the entire dive team into the sea and floats 
free to be decompressed at a safe location.
To enhance the divers’ safety, the dive control rooms 
are fitted with communication to all important positions 
on the vessel and direct priority communication to the 
vessel bridge. All diving systems are built to class 
standards (ABS) and are operated and maintained under 
IMCA (International Marine Contractors Association) 
Guidelines for Diving Operations.

S
trategic Marine Mexico, a shipyard of the Strategic 
Marine Group headquartered in Western Australia, 
recently launched its first 52m crew boat, Aramara, 
for Arrendadora Ocean Mexicana (Blue Marine). The 
official naming ceremony for the vessel was scheduled 
for 28 September 2009 and was held at the company’s 
shipyard in Mazatlan.
Aramara has an all-aluminium hull and 
superstructure and her deck is constructed of 
aluminium and timber. 
She was designed using Maxsurf, AutoCAD and 
Solidworks computer-aided design (CAD) software. 
The vessel is a significant milestone in Strategic 
Marine’s history. Managing director of Strategic 
Marine, Ron F Anderson, said: “This is the first vessel 
to be delivered by our Mexican shipyard, and it is also 
the first Strategic Marine vessel destined for the Gulf 
of Mexico...A goal that has been 5 years in the 
making.”
The 52m crew boat is one of two vessels (the other 
being sister Lluavi) contracted to Blue Marine, both 
vessels will be operated by Blue Marine as part of a 
long-term contract with national oil giant PEMEX 
(Petróleos Mexicanos). 
The construction of Aramara and Lluavi form part 
of the plan for renovation and modernisation of the 
fleet of PEMEX Exploration and Production; these 
vessels will provide support for platforms from the 
home port in Ciudad Del Carmen.
Strategic Marine and joint venture partner Servicios 
Navales E Industriales SA de CV (SENI) remain 
focused on establishing a strong foothold in the 
Americas shipbuilding industry. A move that was 
recently confirmed when SENI were recently awarded 
a contract to construct two 35m buoy tenders for the 
Mexico Ministry of Communications and Transport.
The crew boats are based on Strategic Marine’s Deep-V 
high-speed planing hull and will be operated by a 
10-man crew with a 60 passengers-capacity in addition 
to 100tonnes of cargo at a cruising speed of 20kts.
The design and construction of the vessel was both a 
challenging and rewarding project for Strategic 
Marine, and is the relatively young Mexican yard’s first 
vessel to be launched.

a Fong is the latest CMCS catamaran design to be 
delivered from Wang Tak Shipyard in Hong Kong. 
The vessel, delivered in April 2009 is a fuel-efficient 
high-speed catamaran ferry that has been proven to be 
a good solution for low cost operations and features 
very low fuel burn.  
The loaded speed is more than 27kts, which is very 
impressive considering that she is only powered by two 
engines, MTU 16V2000 engines at 1040kW each. A 
comfortable ride is achieved with the Deep-V hull 
shape and the vessel also boasts low vibration. The 
noise level on the main deck has not exceeded 65dBa.
Ba Fong was built according to China Classification 
Society classifications and the ferry is built to export 
quality according to the designers. 
The passenger space layout accommodates 194 
passengers on the main deck and 37 VIP on the upper 
deck plus a private VIP room and 1 x 2 berth and 1 x 
4 berth crew cabins. 
This vessel has been built in Guangzhou (Canton) 
China by Guangdong Hongshen Shipyard, which is a 
joint venture between Wang Tak and a local shipyard. 
This shipyard has been operating for many years prior 
to building its first passenger catamaran.

D
uring the first quarter of 2009, the entry to service 
of what is believed to be the world’s first hybrid tug, 
Foss’ Carolyn Dorothy, marked the introduction of a new 
kind of environmentally sound, cost effective technology 
designed specifically for the maritime industry. The 
innovative tug design was jointly developed by Foss 
Maritime and Aspin Kemp and Associates (AKA). 
Carolyn Dorothy is based on the Robert Allan Ltd-
designed Dolphin class and was built at the Foss shipyard 
in Rainier, Oregon. It has received high praise from 
industry analysts and environmental officials alike, 
winning the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 
Clean Air Excellence Award for Clean Air Technology.
The hybrid system employed on Carolyn Dorothy 
combines smaller main engines (compared to a 
conventional vessel of equal capability) with electric 
propulsion motor/generators. It permits engines to shut 
down when not required and keeps engines at or near 
their design points when running. Energy stored in 
batteries is used to meet low-end power requirements 
and bridge transient periods when power is required, 
but engines are not yet at speed. 
The hybrid tug has two main diesel engines, shafted 
to azimuth stern drives (ASD).  Motor/generators are 
AC machines which function both as motors, when 
required to provide mechanical power, and as generators, 
when needed to provide electrical power back to the 
system. The system also incorporates two auxiliary 
diesel generator sets to supply electrical power for 
propulsion, hotel services, and battery charging. One or 
both auxiliary generators can provide propulsive power; 
the number of generators in operation is determined by 
the demands of the propulsion system, hotel and 
miscellaneous other loads (e.g. the deck winch).  
The propulsion system is designed to work in either 
hybrid or conventional mode. In normal operation the 
vessel operates in hybrid mode, but conventional mode 
is available for emergencies. In hybrid mode, full 
propulsion power is available to the operator, under four 
separate readiness levels; Stop, Idle, Transit and Assist, 
established from operations reviews, engine operating 
data and history, boat activity logs and discussions with 
crew members and shore-side personnel.
The Stop level, used when the vessel is secured 
alongside, disables motor/generators and removes the 
throttle reference from the hybrid control system, as 
well as shutting down the main engines. At this level, 
power for hotel loads and battery charging is provided 
by shore power, or batteries if shore power is not 
connected.
The Idle level is used when the vessel is stopped at sea. 
No engines are running at Idle, and the batteries are 
providing power for hotel loads and minimal station 
keeping. A generator will automatically start up and 
come online to recharge batteries when needed, and 
pushing the throttles past a threshold will cue both 
main engines and both auxiliary gensets to start, engine 
clutches to close and power to rise to meet the throttle 
setting.
At Transit level, the EMS starts one auxiliary generator 
set, if none is currently online, to provide power for 
hotel and a 'harbour-speed' of approximately 6knots. 
Advancing the throttle beyond this setting will 
immediately start a second generator, with batteries 
providing "ride-through" power until the second 
generator is online. The Assist level is intended for most 
ship-assist work. When Assist is selected, the EMS starts 
both main engines and both auxiliary generators. 
 The hybrid tug uses auxiliary generators and batteries 
to augment main engines as sources of propulsion 
power; compared to a conventional boat, it therefore 
has vastly increased flexibility in machinery 
configuration. A hybrid can, for example, cruise on a 
single auxiliary generator or allocate power from one 
main engine to both propellers equally. There are 32 
possible configurations of battery, auxiliary generators 
and/or main engines.  
Hybrid technology is a cost effective solution to 
reduce all forms of pollution. Most pollution reduction 
technologies can reduce one form of pollution but often 
increase other pollutants. Hybrid technology addresses 
both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases through 
more efficient combustion and lower fuel consumption, 
respectively.
This patent pending technology is scalable and is 
appropriate for both newbuilds and retrofits to existing 
vessels. The economic benefits of operating a hybrid 
harbour tug are realized through fuel savings and 
reduced maintenance costs for the major equipment. 
Reduced idling and improved efficiency are the main 
sources of fuel economy. Maintenance cost savings are 
expected to accrue from the fact that, with main engines 
shut down most of the time, the elapsed time between 
engine overhauls is increased significantly. Soft cost 
gains are significant and are realized in improved crew 
rest and endurance from lower levels of machinery 
noise. The increased capital costs associated with this 
technology are recouped in less than five years under 
current market conditions.

L
ung Teh Shipyard, the leading yard in high-speed 
vessel construction, has designed, constructed and 
delivered the first of three 30m steel patrol vessels to 
the Hong Kong Marine Department in August 2009.
To perform its primary law enforcement duties and 
patrol and search in the Hong Kong waters, the boat is 
designed as a V-shape hard chine and transom stern 
with good resistance, seakeeping, manoeuvring, low 
noise and vibration performance in weather conditions 
up to Sea State 5 and to provide an effective observation 
platform for crews engaged in continuous operations 
without giving rise to excessive crew fatigue. 
CE2 is designed and constructed as a steel hull with 
a 2-tier aluminium deckhouse. Scantling of hull 
structural members is determined in accordance with 
the Lloyd’s Register’s ‘Rules for Classification of 
Special Service Craft’.
The vessel is equipped with two Caterpillar 3516C 
main engines, two ZF7550V reduction gears and two 
fixed pitch propellers to perform the high speed and 
low speed mission in HKSAR waters.
The air-conditioned wheelhouse located on the 
second tier of deckhouse is designed for six officers 
and in a configuration to provide three consoles 
including steering, engine monitoring and 
communication. All the consoles are an ergonomical 
configuration with the more frequently used controls 
grouped within easy reach of a man of normal Asian 
stature in the sitting position. The crew mess and 
pantry rooms are arranged on the main deck. Five 
crew cabins including one female cabin are arranged 
under main deck with toilets and shower.
 One 6m aluminium heavy duty rigid hull inflatable 
boat for 10 persons is arranged on the after main deck 
with a rapidly launched/ recovered single arm rescue 
boat crane system.
One maritime surveillance system with day & night 
sensors is arranged and the MSS can provide covert 
detection and observation of all types of targets in 
poor visibility, in the total darkness or bad weather 
and at a distance far beyond the limits of normal 
human vision.
After successful sea trials in Taiwan and Hong Kong 
waters, CE2 is delivered to Hong Kong Customs and 
Excise Department and entered into service to execute 
the sea patrol. 
Another two vessels were scheduled to be delivered 
to HKMD in September and November 2009.

ity of Portland is a state-of-the-art fire-fighting 
vessel built by AF Theriault & Son Ltd of Nova 
Scotia, Canada and designed by Robert Allan Limited 
of Vancouver, Canada for Portland Fire Department in 
Maine, USA. 
The vessel has an ice-strengthened aluminium  
hull and a Bondstrand fibre-reinforced plastic fire-
fighting system piping. City of Portland also has a 
complete medical centre duplicating a road ambulance 
layout. The design will allow emergency medical 
technicians to board the vessel and provide the same 
level of care to patients as they could in a land-based 
ambulance.
City of Portland is an all-weather emergency vessel 
built to serve the city of Portland, as well as 
surrounding communities on Penobscot Bay. 
Fire-fighting equipment onboard includes both 
remote- and manually-controlled water cannons using 
3000gallons/minute pumps, as well as fire-fighting 
foam capability. 
The layout of the vessel includes four control 
stations: wheelhouse in port/starboard, aft deck, fly 
bridge and diving platform aft. Also onboard is a large 
fire-fighting equipment room in hull under the 
wheelhouse and hot water space heating system with a 
diesel furnace in the engineroom. 
Regretfully, City of Portland was involved in an 
accident during a rescue mission in November 2009 
that resulted in a broken propeller, shaft and a 
damaged rudder. She entered Gowen Marine repair 
yard and is expected to re-commence operations 
within the first few months of 2010.

ostante Neri and Corrado Neri are double azimuth 
stern drive (ASD) offshore terminal escort tugs built 
by Astilleros Gondan shipyard in Asturias, Spain for 
Fratelli Neri SpA, a subsidiary of the Neri Group, in 
Livorno Italy. 
The tugs are fully automated stern drive tugs designed 
in response to a worldwide demand for a highly-efficient 
class of ship-assist/oil and gas terminal tug. Highly 
maneuverable, with two azimuth thrusters, Costante 
Neri and Corrado Neri are dedicated for maximum 
efficiency in the performance of ship-handling, tank 
escort and related terminal support activities services. 
Costante Neri and Corrado Neri are equipped with two 
completely independent escort towing winches (each) 
forward allowing to switch from towing to pushing within 
seconds and heavy bow fendering for ship-assist and escort 
work; on the main deck aft is fitted a double drum 
waterfall type winch for anchor-handling and deep-sea 
towage purposes. Each drum is equipped with a complete 
tow line giving redundancy. Thanks to very high bollard 
pull performance and to the fact that it is the first 
application of FiFi II equipment on such a kind of vessel, 
these tugs represent a very leading case in this market.
Although this vessel is intended as dedicated terminal 
support/escort tug for the offshore oil and liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) off-loading tankers, the tugs can be 
deployed for the following services: 
•	 Tanker escort service;
•	 Fire-fighting activities;
•	 Anchor handling/supply activities;
•	 Anti-pollution services;
•	 Salvage operations; and
•	 Transportation of spares/cargo to and from the 
offshore terminal.

F
ar Samson is the most powerful offshore vessel ever 
built, according to designer Rolls-Royce Marine of 
Ulsteinvik, Norway. This impressive vessel was initiated 
by owner, Farstad Shipping of Norway, and realised by 
Rolls-Royce in close co-operation with the owner.
Rolls-Royce developed the special design based upon 
Farstad’s requirements, working in close cooperation with 
the owner and charterer. The UT 761 CD has been built 
by STX Europe Langsten (formerly Aker Yards Langsten), 
and is now on a long term charter.
Far Samson has a continuous bollard pull of 423tonnes 
with all three auxiliary thrusters operating and 377tonnes 
under main propellers alone.
The UT 761 CD design is a multifunctional vessel 
capable of carrying out heavy ploughing operations for 
pipes and cables on the seabed, subsea installation work 
in ultra deepwater, remotely operated underwater 
vehicle (ROV) operations, towing, and other challenging 
subsea operations. The specification calls for ploughing 
to a cut depth of 2.5m in the seabed in water up to 
1000m depth.
Meeting the various demands means a large vessel, 
121.5m long overall, 26m beam, 15,620gt, the hull 
strengthened to Ice Class 1B, having also De-Ice Class 
for operation in iced waters and harsh conditions. Hull 
lines are optimised for the required 12-17kts transit 
speed range, allowing the ship to mobilise efficiently 
for operations anywhere in the world. The top speed is 
approximately 20kts. The draught is more than 8m to 
give sufficient immersion to the large propellers. The 
hullform incorporates a bow bulb and stern sections 
designed to give a clear flow of water to the propellers 
to satisfy the requirement for an extremely high  
bollard pull.
During design and construction of this Clean Design 
vessel, utmost attention was paid to internal and external 
environmental aspects as well as the safety conditions for 
vessel and crew.
An unusual feature of the UT 761 CD is two working 
deck levels. The space over the main deck houses the 
winches and is open at the stern, allowing wires to be 
run over a stern roller. It is flanked by workshops and 
winches for the A-frame and crane, provided by National 
Oilwell Varco. Above it is the working/weather deck 
fitted with a track system and transportation skids 
provided by AxTech for deploying either of the two 
massive ploughs offshore. An A-frame delivered by 
AxTech with a 250tonnes safe working load (SWL) 
offshore and active heave compensation winch is 
mounted at the aft end of the deck. Between the working 
deck and the accommodation is a large ROV hangar. A 
7.2m x 7.2m moonpool is provided amidship with a 
hatch in the work deck and with a closable hatch at the 
bottom to prevent sea water pumping at the high transit 
speed. Equipment can be deployed through the 
moonpool using the offshore crane from National 
Oilwell Varco, which is rated for a 250tonnes lift up to 
35m outreach and 3500m working depth. 
Far Samson has a hybrid propulsion combining diesel 
electric and diesel mechanical transmission to give 
optimal operating flexibility, fuel economy and minimum 
exhaust emissions. Depending on the type of operation, 
the UT 761 CD can run in any of six principal propulsion 
modes. This flexibility means that the widely varying 
power requirements are efficiently catered to, there is a 
high level of propulsion redundancy, and engines are run 
at an efficient part of their load range, minimising exhaust 
emissions. All Bergen engines meet Clean Design class 
rules without further exhaust clean-up, but catalytic 
converters are additionally fitted to the gensets, giving 
95% NOx reduction.
One major role for the new Farstad vessel will be 
pipeline trenching. The charterer is a leading specialist in 
this type of work and has developed a new generation 
plough that is capable of cutting a 2.5m deep trench in 
the seabed, compared with the 1.5m typical previously, 
allowing for larger pipe diameters and giving the pipe 
better protection. 
A distinctive feature of the design is a double deck 
bridge layout. The navigation wheelhouse follows current 
UT-Design principles, with a semicircular bridge front 
and the main forward facing control station for transit 
and navigation placed for optimum sight lines. On the 
deck below is a second set of consoles enjoying a good 
view over the working deck, from which ploughing and 
other winch operations can be controlled. DP3 and other 
controls are also slaved to this position. On the same deck 
is a plough/control/survey space, an instrument room, 
suites of offices and a conference room. 
Far Samson will be responsible for picking up the 
ploughs and use the first period of work for commissioning 
tests and mobilisation. Various projects such as subsea 
support, ROV support and craneage work have been 
scheduled in between the ploughing operations.
This is a large, expensive and complex vessel. With a 
bollard of 280tonnes this is a less powerful vessel, but it 
has for many years handled deep water ploughing 
giving great satisfaction, trenching to what has been up 
to now the normal depth of cut of 1.5m in up to 500m 
water depth.

F
arasan is one of two 69m Austal high-speed 
vehicle/passenger catamaran ferries delivered to 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in April 2009.
With the capacity to carry 650 passengers, 50 cars 
and 15 trucks, the two aluminium catamarans are part 
of a group of four Austal vehicle-passenger ferries 
ordered by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Finance  
in 2007.
Farasan and Jazan are operated by The Maritime  
Co. for Navigation from the port of Jazan in the south 
of Saudi Arabia along a 25 nautical mile route to 
Farasan Island.
As the island’s main link to the mainland, the vessels’ 
multi-purpose design features a vehicle deck carrying 
capacity typical of much larger platforms, with space 
for 15 7tonnes trucks and maximum axle loads of up 
to 10tonnes. There is also space for 50 cars with trucks 
or 74 cars without trucks. 
Austal has designed and installed both bow and stern 
vehicle ramps to ensure efficient vehicle transfer and 
reduced port turnaround times, meeting the client’s 
need for “drive-through” capability.
Suited to the short distance of the intended route, each 
vessel has a cost effective service speed of 32knots, with 
power from four MTU 16V 4000 M73L diesel engines 
producing 2880kW each. Utilising advanced design 
technology, the vessel’s hull forms have been optimised to 
ensure maximum fuel efficiency, which, along with the 
cost-effective service speed, deliver fuel consumption of 
only 2.21tonnes/hour (including generators). 
The high passenger density expected on the service 
meant Austal’s interior design team worked closely 
with the client to develop a highly practical seating 
arrangement for 650 passengers that maximises space 
and accessibility. All seating is situated on the upper 
deck, with seating density deliberately maintained at a 
passenger-friendly level of no more than three seats  
per row. 
Facilities located on the passenger deck include a 
boutique gift store, food preparation and service area 
and a dedicated VIP lounge overlooking the bow. 
In consideration of the cultural requirements of the 
route’s predominantly Muslim clientele, the passenger 
deck features a dedicated seating area for families and 
children, as well as both men and women’s prayer 
rooms and a children’s play room.
Farasan Island’s relatively small port means that 
vessel manoeuvrability was another important design 
consideration. Electric bow thrusters installed on each 
hull improve vessel manoeuvrability at slow speed in 
harbour, while passenger comfort is assured with the 
installation of Austal Ride Control, incorporating two 
interceptors and two forward T-foils.
A state-of-the-art bridge deck features the Austal-
developed Marine Link ship control and monitoring 
system, allowing extensive monitoring of core onboard 
equipment as well as providing a comprehensive 
on-line system to manage all user manuals as well as 
ship drawings and documentation.

H
ai Yu and Hai Jun are the latest CMCS catamaran 
designs to be delivered from Wang Tak Shipyard 
in Hong Kong. The vessels, delivered in September 
and December 2009 are fuel-efficient high-speed 
catamaran ferries that have been proven to be a good 
solution for low-cost operations and feature very low 
fuel burn.
The loaded speed is more than 27kts, which is very 
impressive considering that she is only powered by two 
engines, CAT C-32 engines at 1045kW each. A 
comfortable ride is achieved with the Deep-V hull 
shape and the vessel also boasts low vibration. The 
noise level on the main deck has not exceeded 70dBa.
Hai Yu and Hai Jun were built according to China 
Classification Society rules and the ferry is built to 
export quality according to engineers.
The passenger space layout accommodates 177 
passengers on the main deck and 66 VIP on the upper 
deck, plus two private VIP rooms and 2 x 2 berth and 
1 x 4 berth crew cabins.
This vessel has been built by Guangdong Hongshen 
Shipyard, which is a joint venture between Wang Tak 
and China State Shipping Co., Shenzhen subsidiary 
company. This shipyard has completed 10 AL ferries 
to date.

K
eppel Singmarine Pte Limited, the specialised 
vessel-building subsidiary of Keppel Offshore and 
Marine (Keppel O&M), has delivered a multipurpose 
duty rescue vessel to Lukoil-Kaliningradmorneft 
(hereafter referred to as Lukoil).
Lukoil has worked with Keppel Singmarine for the 
last four years on specialised shipbuilding projects 
such as Asia’s first ice-breaking vessels, two ice-class 
anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels and a 
floating storage and offloading vessel, which is, at the 
time of writing, in the process of being completed by 
sister yard, Caspian Shipyard company in the Caspian 
Sea.
Jointly designed by Marine Technology Development 
(MTD), the ship design and development arm of 
Keppel O&M and ship design consultants Robert 
Allan Limited, Kogalym is the fifth vessel that Keppel 
Singmarine has delivered to Lukoil since 2003.
Deputy general-director, Victor Velikov, said: 
“Heavy-duty support vessels such as Kogalym are 
highly valuable in ensuring smooth offshore operations 
all year round in the unique weather conditions of the 
Caspian Sea. Keppel Singmarine has demonstrated its 
strong capabilities and commitment once again, with 
the timely delivery of another fine vessel. The company 
has proven itself over the years as a reliable partner to 
Lukoil, and we are pleased that the rest of our vessels 
being constructed by them are progressing well.” 
Kogalym was named after a key oil production region 
for Lukoil in western Siberia. The 60tonnes bollard 
pull vessel is for deployment in the Caspian Sea region 
to perform supply duty and rescue operations in 
temperatures as low as -20°C and ice-thickness of up 
to 70cm.
Executive director of Keppel Singmarine, Hoe Eng 
Hock, said: “Through the successful delivery of 
Kogalym and several other important projects, we have 
developed a good understanding of Lukoil’s operating 
requirements be it in the Caspian Sea or Arctic regions. 
In the process, we have also honed our expertise in 
designing, engineering and constructing advanced ice-
capable vessels. 
Keppel Singmarine is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Keppel Corporation Limited through Keppel O&M. 
Since the early 1970s, Keppel Singmarine has designed 
and built more than 400 small to medium-sized vessels 
including AHTS, multi-purpose support vessels and 
tugboats for a worldwide clientele. 
Lukoil-Kaliningradmorneft is a subsidiary of Lukoil 
Oil Company, a leading Russian oil company with 
main activities in oil and gas exploration and 
production and sale of petroleum products. It is 
engaged in marine towing, handling of crude oil and 
petroleum products, fabrication of mobile drilling 
rigs, production of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and 
marketing of Lukoil-produced fuels and lubricants.

Delivery date........................... September 2009
T
he Port of London Authority (PLA) has invested 
£2 million (US$3.1 million) in a fleet of five 
new, specially designed harbour patrol launches to 
patrol the Thames River. The first vessel, Lambeth, 
was delivered to PLA in September 2009; three 
months after sea trials had taken place. 
Lambeth is a deep-V catamaran hull and her  
‘Wave Length’ design was developed in conjunction 
with Newcastle University and tested in the towing 
tanks at the University. The characteristics of a deep-V 
hull form allows for low resistance and good  
sea-keeping. Her structural design has been optimised 
in order to reduce the overall weight of the boat 
thereby enhancing performance and as a result 
allowing her to achieve a top speed of 21kts with just 
400bhp of installed power, making her one of the 
most environmentally friendly harbour patrol boats 
in operation.    
Lambeth has a comfortable wheelhouse with a 
galley, a WC and seating for 12 passengers, as well as 
ample working deck space and two ‘step down’ 
platforms aft for waterborne recovery operations or 
diver support. She is also fitted with pilot boarding 
steps which can be removed when she is not engaged 
in pilot duties and a lowering mast for low air  
draught bridges. 
The design of the new launches is the product of 
five years of careful research and development, aimed 
at equipping the harbour and pilotage services with 
the most modern and efficient vessels for the job.
The vessel and her four sisters will produce 
substantially lower exhaust emissions than other 
vessels of their type, reduced fuel consumption, 
reduced wash wave generation, easier maintenance 
and operation due to their design and improved 
reliability and availability using innovative engineering 
to design out known sources of equipment failure. 
Lambeth and her sister patrol boats will be used in 
the middle and lower districts of the tidal Thames, 
between Putney Bridge and the North Sea.

Contract date...............................October 2007
Delivery date......................................April 2009
L
amnalco Sana'a, the first in a series of four new 
high-performance terminal/escort tugs, was 
delivered by Med Marine of Turkey to Lamnalco 
Group of the United Arab Emirates in April 2009. 
Two of the other sister vessels Lamnalco Aden and 
Lamnalco Mukalla were delivered later in 2009.
Lamnalco Sana'a is the latest in a series of RAstar 
tugs being built for liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
terminal operations worldwide to new designs 
developed by Robert Allan Ltd., naval architects of 
Vancouver, British Columbia.
This powerful escort tug is equipped for  
typical ship-handling and escort work, with a  
Plimsoll model PC-HAETW/CDDG-26-50/250 
double-drum hawser winch on the fore deck, with a 
capacity for each drum of 300m, 64mm diameter plus 
150m of 80mm UHMWPE synthetic hawser. The 
escort-rated winch is driven by a twin-pump electro-
hydraulic set, and features a two speed drive system, 
capable of line recover/rendering at 50tonnes line  
pull at 20m/minute, or 16tonnes at 60 m/minute  
(first layer).
The aft deck is fitted with a heavy duty towing 
winch, a Plimsoll model PC-HTW/SD-80/150, fitted 
with 750 m of 52 mm diameter SWR, with a brake 
capacity of 150 t. The aft deck is also fitted with 
Plimsoll pneumatic towing hook with rated load of 
100tonnes and a large knuckle boom crane.
Accommodations are to a very high standard for a 
crew of up to ten persons. Two spacious officer's cabins 
on the main deck each have private en-suite facilities, 
while two of the four double cabins below deck also 
have private en-suite facilities.
The fully equipped galley serves a large common 
lounge/mess area, equipped with the latest in video 
and audio entertainment systems.
Attention was paid throughout the design process to 
mitigating the propagation of noise and vibration 
through the essential resilient mounting of the main 
engines, isolation of all exhaust system components, 
and the extensive use of visco-elastic floating floor 
systems throughout.
The wheelhouse is designed to provide maximum 
all-round visibility from a single split type master 
console.
Lamnalco Sana'a is built in accordance with Bureau 
Veritas regulations for a 1  Hull,  Mach  Escort 
Tug, Fire Fighting Ship 1 with water spray, AUT 
UMS, unrestricted service.
The fire-fighting capability is provided by a pair of 
FFS main-engine driven pumps, each rated 1378m³/
hour, which serve a pair of FFS-1200SB water/foam 
monitors, each rated at 1,200m³/hour, and the self-
protection waterspray system.
Electric power is developed by three 315kW diesel 
gensets, and by a third harbour/emergency genset, 
rated at 90kW.
The main propulsion components include a Wärtsilä 
9L26 rated at 3060kW at 1000rpm at 100% MCR 
and LIPS Model CS300-S1WN-K Z-Drives with an 
input power of 3060kW at 1000rpm.
The RAstar design hull form incorporates a 
significant sponson on the upper hull sides. When the 
tug is heeled over under influence of the towline 
during an escort operation, the "downhill" sponson is 
submerged and a large righting force is generated to 
improve the stability, thus increasing the towline 
force. In addition, the hull has a large foil-shaped 
skeg, also designed to increase indirect towline forces. 
The RAstar hull form also provides dramatic 
reductions in roll amplitude and roll accelerations, 
thus providing a safer and more comfortable platform 
for crews, who are now being asked to conduct 
docking operations at LNG terminals and similar 
installations in up to sea-states of 3.0m significant 
wave heights.

D
amen Stan Patrol 3507, Mako Shark, is the first 
of a series of 10 patrol vessels that Damen has 
built for The Singapore Police Coast Guard. This ship 
is constructed entirely of aluminium and has a 
propulsion system existing of three MTU 16V4000 
engines driving Hamilton waterjets. The total 
propulsive power is 7500 kW, which results in a top 
speed op 35+ knots.
Mako Shark PH 51 patrol boat was officially handed 
over by Dutch shipbuilder, Damen Shipyards Group, 
from their Singapore yard to the Singapore Police 
Coast Guard (PCG) at the PCG Brani Base on 3 
February 2009.
The guests-of-honour, police commissioner, Khoo 
Boon Hui, and managing director of Damen Shipyards 
Group, Erik van der Noorda, signed the handover 
certificate at the ceremony, signalling Singapore Police 
Force’s (SPF) acquisition of its first second-generation 
coastal patrol craft.
CP Khoo, SPF leadership group members, and the 
top personnel of Damen Shipyards Group were then 
invited onboard the Mako Shark PH 51 for a short 
journey along Singapore’s south coast. The guests  
were also taken on a tour of the boat, during which 
they were shown how it operates, much to their  
delight and awe.
Being a high quality build, the Mako Shark PH 51 
boasts several exceptional capabilities. Requiring 15 
men to operate, the patrol craft can travel at an 
impressive maximum speed of 40kts, or up to 75kph. 
It also packs features a fully automated firing control 
system. The firing control system will automatically 
track targets at sea, and fires at a rate of 100 to 200 
rounds per minute, with an accuracy of approximately 
one hit for every five rounds fired.
With a displacement of 140tonnes and a length of 
35m, Mako Shark is the largest patrol vessel to enter 
service with the PCG, and will undertake patrol duties 
of the country's territorial waters. The vessel is capable 
of speeds of up to 35kts, and is armed with a 25mm 
Rafael Typhoon and 2 CIS 50 12.7mm machine 
guns.
Sergeant Teo Zi Qiang, chief radar plotter onboard 
the Mako Shark PH 51, was more than impressed with 
the new patrol craft. He said: “The Mako Shark PH 51 
is evidently bigger than the previous craft I worked 
aboard. Efficiency is also much higher onboard the 
new boat, as almost everything is automated and there 
is much more equipment available for us to carry out 
our duties. Of course, our living quarters are more 
spacious, and everything is new, so living conditions 
are significantly better as well.”

P
olish shipyard Remontowa has successfully 
delivered a double-ended liquefied natural gas 
(LNG)-fuelled car/passenger ferry to owner Fjord1 
MRF AS headquartered in Florø, Norway in December 
2009.
This complex vessel was co-designed by LMG Marin 
and Remontowa using Autocad/Cadmatic software and 
model tested in CTO Poland. The hull superstructure 
of Moldefjord is constructed of mild steel.
Remontowa shipyard has more than ten years 
experience in designing and construction of car 
passenger ferries of different types and capacities for 
the west European market – and Norwegian clients are 
one of the key and perspective clients for the yard. 
Moldefjord and her sisters have been designed in 
cooperation between Remontowa Design Office and 
LMG Marin. The project represents a new generation 
of vessels, gas fuelled, which of course is very important 
for environmental protection and which fulfills very 
restrictive international regulations concerning the 
level of unacceptable emissions. The ferries will be 
included in a public transport of passenger/cars in 
Norway in the area of Molde.
Moldefjord has a symmetric, double-ended hull with 
continuous deck for private cars and trucks – with 
access via hydraulically operated ramps and additional 
tween deck with two car lines on starboard side. The 
passenger lounge, HC restroom and number of 
passenger restrooms are provided. The propulsion 
system is of gas/diesel-electric type with azimuth 
thrusters mounted on each end of the vessel. The 
electricity will be produced by three generating sets: two 
of them LNG gas fuelled and one spare – regular diesel 
type. The vessels are highly automatic and optimized in 
respect of number of crew and fuel consumption.
The deck equipment onboard Moldefjord includes 2 
Hydroster/Rexroth hydraulic power units, 2 HCV30kN 
SEC capstans, 1 HADW75KN SEC windlass and 2 
bow ramps of 12m x 2.8m also by Hydroster.
Bridge electronic equipment onboard Moldefjord is 
mostly supplied by Raytheon Anschütz of Germany 
apart from the GMDSS which is by Sailor, the global 
positioning system (GPS) which is by JLR and the 
automatic identification system which is by JHS.  
Moldefjord will be operating in the Molde-Vestness 
area of Norway.

S
outh Boats Special Projects Ltd (SBSP) has 
successfully delivered its largest catamaran to date, 
and most significantly one of the most important crew 
vessels to be built for the offshore renewable sector.
MPI Don Quixote is a South Catamaran 20m alloy 
wind farm service vessel and measures 20.9m loa, 
8.5m beam, has a draught of 1.2m and has a lightship 
displacement (including fluids) of 54tonnes. The boat 
is the most capable boat yet built by SBSP and the 
vessel is equipped with a vast array of equipment to 
ensure that she can fulfil many diverse tasks on wind 
farm projects that are traditionally fulfilled by many 
smaller vessels.
MPI Workboats Ltd. is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
MPI Offshore Ltd. who own and operate the world’s 
largest self-propelled jack-up wind farm construction 
vessel, the MPI Resolution. MPI Workboats currently 
operate three South Catamaran 15m Wind Farm 
Service Vessels, the MPI Sancho Panza, MPI Rosinante 
and MPI Rucio that are currently working on the West 
and East Coasts of the UK. MPI Don Quixote is 
currently contracted to Siemens and is working on the 
Lynn & Inner Dowsing Offshore Wind Farm project 
from Grimsby.
Ben Colman of SBSP, said: “We are delighted with 
the quality and performance of this vessel; we don’t 
believe there is anything with her capabilities in service 
and we are grateful to MPI for their valued order and 
commitment. MPI have already ordered further vessels 
and we look forward to working with them on these 
new and exciting projects”.
The vessel follows standard South Boats design 
principles with symmetrical under water sections and 
asymmetrical wet deck knuckles and spray deflectors. 
The design includes a high buoyancy bow and triple 
internal spray knuckles to maintain a suspension of 
air/water to dampen pitching moments particularly in 
heavy weather. In addition the hulls maintain a parallel 
waterline beam through the length of the vessel 
allowing for good weight distribution around the 
vessel. The design offers class leading sea keeping, 
stability, fuel efficiency and manoeuvrability. The sea 
keeping in particular has been proven in service 
operating in excess of 2.5m significant wave height.
MPI Don Quixote is constructed of aluminium and 
is generally in accordance with Lloyd’s Special Service 
Craft Rules with all metal of marine grade 50830 and 
6082T6 extrusions meeting the requirements of 
Lloyd’s Register of Shipping and Det Norske Veritas. 
Metal thicknesses vary to suit panel construction but 
typically 15mm at the keel, 8-12mm bottom flat, 
6mm to the chine, 8mm chine bars, 5mm topsides 
and 5mm wheelhouse. To avoid edge to edge welding 
with differing sheet thicknesses, chine bars are used 
extensively to increase structural strength and avoid 
any thermal distortion and welding stress. Shell plating 
is spaced away from the frames at certain points to 
avoid stress points and all chine bars are slotted with 
radiused corners into the framing. The substantial 
framing and shell plating ensures maximum durability 
in an industry where vessel down time cannot be 
tolerated. Synergic, MIG & TIG welding practices are 
adopted and all welds are inspected and die penned 
prior to signing off. All hull transitions are fitted with 
a welded aluminium tube and flange bolted though a 
stainless flange insulated with Nebar gasket before 
stainless steel lever valves and Lloyd’s approved hoses.
The vessel features an ‘Island’ superstructure forward 
with a 64m² working deck aft and 24m² working deck 
forward. The vessel has an open transom to enable 
easy access to the jet platforms and for loading heavier 
items without the need to lift over the bulwarks. The 
crane dominates the transom of the vessel but at the 
bow there is a MkIV bow loading platform to enable 
the vessel to work on offshore wind farms and also a 
Hercules Hydraulics rope and anchor handling 
capstan. The vessel is also fitted with an integral fuel 
transfer system to refuel wind turbine generators and 
has the ability to carry 10tonnes of fuel bunkers for 
transfer. The system has pumps rated to 40m pressure 
head and has a 40m hose reel and fuel nozzle stowed 
on the forward deck.
The vessel is fitted with twin MTU 10V2000 M72 
1205hp main engines close coupled to ZF3000 1.5:1 
reduction ratio gearboxes driving a carden shaft 
through a gas tight bulkhead seal to the Ultra 
Dynamics UJ575 water jet units.
This propulsion package offers the vessel a sprint 
speed of 27kts (with nearly 30kts recorded on trials at 
times) and a 24kt cruising speed at 2000rpm (combined 
300ltrs/hr). At low cruising speeds (18kts at 1900rpm) 
the vessel offers a frugal fuel consumption of 200litres/
hour. At full 60tonnes displacement with full 
compliment of passengers, crew and 10 tonnes of deck 
cargo the vessel can still achieve speeds in excess of 
24kts, well in excess of yard and client expectations.
The fuel tank spaces are forward of he engine rooms 
and each is fitted with a 3000litres and 2000litres 
aluminium fuel tank fitted with a 2.5inches cam lock 
filler fitting. The tanks have electric level gauges and 
also have calibrated dipsticks. The vessel is also fitted 
with 500litres of fresh water, 300litres of black water 
tanks, 80litres hot water calorifier, 150litres hydraulic 
tank, a 22kW Onan generator set and various air 
conditioning and fuel transfer pumps.
All compartments are fitted with bilge level alarms, 
electric KPM Bilge Predator pumps and the engine 
and fuel tank spaces are fitted with a STAT X smoke 
and fire detection and suppression system.
MPI Don Quixote has been inspected by the MCA 
with drawing approval, stability book and build checks 
and certified to operate under MCA Workboat Code to 
Operate in Category 2 Waters (60nm) for 12 passengers, 
3 crew and 10,000kg’s of deck cargo in normal operation. 
For heavy lift operations the vessel has been inclined to 
check to carry up to 25tonnes on the after deck.

S
wedish pilot and patrol boat builder Dockstavarvet 
has delivered a new 16.5m very high-speed police/
patrol craft design to multiple buyers. The new craft 
is an improved and upgraded version of the highly 
successful Interceptor Craft (IC) 16 M type of which 
a total of close to 30 units are already in service/in 
build for customers in Malaysia, Mexico, Poland and 
Russia. The standard IC 16m with 2 x 810kW main 
engines and axial flow waterjets has a sprint speed of 
50+knots. The Mexican Navy version has been 
configured as a landing craft with a bow ramp and 
seating for 18 soldiers instead of the normal crew 
accommodation.
The new IC 16.5m design has been enlarged and 
optimised to carry engines up to 2 x 1100kW and 
waterjets of the mixed flow type to be able to achieve 
speeds of over 53kts. Main dimension are 16.5m x 
4.00m with a draught of 1.2m at a lightship 
displacement of 21tonnes. The accommodation can 
be laid out for a crew of 4 to 6 persons and the 
wheelhouse will be resiliently mounted to get a 
comfortable noise level inside even at full speed. 
Technical installations will be to the highest standards 
developed by Dockstavarvet while building totally 
almost 300 high speed police/patrol/attack crafts of 
the CB 90 H and IC 16 M types over the last 20 
years. 
Accumulated running hours are well over one 
million.
The first two units based on the IC 16.5 M concept 
are laid out as VIP launches for a Middle-Eastern 
customer and have already been delivered. The new 
design will now be marketed as a top-of-the-line high-
speed interceptor while the existing IC 16 M will 
continue as the landing craft alternative.

S
hipyard Hijos de J. Barreras of Vigo (Barreras 
shipyard) has delivered the second in a family of 
four ferries, Passió per Formentera, to shipowner 
Baleària during a private ceremony held in September. 
Both Baleària and Barreras shipyard have each 
contributed their vast experience and know-how to 
this ferry’s design and construction.
The construction of Passió per Formentera involved 
an investment of €42 million (US$62.9 million) and 
involved 1,400,000 hours of work carried out by the 
shipyard’s staff and the auxiliary industry in Vigo. 
Passió per Formentera is part of the new series of vessels 
that Baleària ordered to the shipyard, the first of 
which – Martín i Soler, is fully operating since January 
2009. Martín i Soler is larger in size than Passió  
per Formentera, but is of very similar design. Just  
like Martín i Soler and the two vessels still under 
construction, Passió per Formentera adapts to the 
peculiarities of the different ports and marine  
traffic perfectly well. The hull of the vessel was 
constructed at Barreras shipyard but completed at 
Portuguese shipyard Estaleiros Navais de Viana do 
Castelo (ENVC). 
Passió per Formentera is also a tourist slogan for the 
smallest of the Balearic Islands.
In keeping with the slogan this passenger ferry – the 
smallest one of the series – was designed to optimise 
the port infrastructures of the island and to deal with 
the traffic between Formentera and Ibiza and between 
Formentera and mainland Spain. The project was 
developed by the technical departments of Barreras 
shipyard and Baleària through a resource and 
development and innovation programme.
The ferry has six decks, two of them being designed 
for cargo purposes.
Passió per Formentera is 101m loa and 17m beam, 
has a capacity for 800 people – crew and passengers 
included, and can house 80 cars and eight trailer 
trucks combined. Furthermore, a modular system 
allows 304 lane metres for trailers or 540 lane metres 
for cars in the hold. Thanks to the ramps located at 
stern and bow, loading operations can be made easily 
and quickly.
Like in the other vessels of the series, the energy 
consumption has been optimised.
Propulsion has been solved with two main motors 
of 4500kW each – 9000kW in total, that allow a 
service speed of 20kts. These state-of-the-art motors 
have been supplied by Norwegian manufacturer 
Rolls-Royce Bergen. This way, the level of emissions 
has been minimised and is very much below the one 
required by the environmental regulations.
Lifts and a mechanical ramp allow easy and quick 
access of passengers from the hold or from the dock to 
the passenger areas.
Just like the other vessels of the Baleària + series, the 
interior design is impeccable and so are the seat design 
and ergonomics. The vessel has spacious exterior 
terraces where to enjoy the navigation comfortably. 
Company Oliver Design – specialised in ships 
architectural projects and Valencian decorator Jorge 
Belloch collaborated in this project.

P
ilbara Thor is the latest of the RAmparts 3200-class 
tugs to be built from a design by Robert Allan, 
Vancouver, Canada. Delivered by New Zealand-based 
Shipco Marine Constructors of Whangarei in December 
2008, Pilbara Thor is the first of two new terminal 
support tugs for Australia’s Rio Tinto. The vessel 
entered service at the Pilbara ore terminal near Dampier, 
Australia in January 2009.
 Robert Allan worked closely with the Rio Tinto’s 
representatives, Trevor Cosh and Associates and 
Edwards Marine Services to establish the final 
specification and vessel layout for the demanding service 
of this 32m x 11.6m tug. The hull form reflects the 
double chine form that characterises all Robert Allan 
designs, with a sweeping ‘chined’ stern. A large escort 
skeg is fitted forward to enhance the indirect towing 
capability and to provide enhanced roll stability.
On trials the vessel performed well, achieving a 
sustained mean bollard pull of 70.5tonnes ahead, and 
67.5tonnes astern at full power and a free-running 
speed of 12.8kts ahead and over 12kts astern. Features 
of the RAmparts 3200 design include a half-raised 
forecastle running nearly half the length of the tug to 
provide a high standard of accommodation and a good 
sea-keeping capability for operation in exposed 
conditions. The fore deck is served by two line-handling 
winches and a double aperture staple. 
The vessel has been outfitted to the highest standards 
for a crew of up to six people, although the normal 
operating crew is three. The main deck features a ship's 
office and a spacious crew mess/lounge, served by a fully 
equipped, modern galley. 
 The wheelhouse is designed for maximum all-round 
visibility with a single control station providing 
maximum visibility to both fore and aft deck working 
areas. Noise levels below 60dBA were achieved 
throughout the accommodation and control spaces of 
the tug by utilising advanced methods of isolating main 
propulsion machinery, as well as high grade insulations 
and floating floor techniques. 
Main propulsion for Pilbara Thor comprises a pair of 
Niigata 6L 28HX diesel engines, each rated 1838kW at 
750rpm, and each driving a Niigata Model ZP 41 fixed 
pitch Z-drive unit, through a Niigata HLP80Y type 
slipping clutch and Stromag Flex Coupling, all in ASD 
configuration. The electrical plant comprises two 
identical Volvo Penta diesel gensets, each with a 
415V/50Hz. power output of 120kW. 
Fire-fighting is to Fi-Fi 1 Class, using Counterfire 
pumps and monitors. The two pumps are driven from 
the front of the main engines through Kumera PTOs. 
The port pump is rated 1500m³/hour, which includes 
the required deluge capacity, and the starboard pump is 
rated 1200m³/hour. Foam is injected into the system 
via a round-the-pump type inductor.
 The main hawser winches forward, manufactured 
directly by Shipco Marine Constructors are single 
drum type, each containing 100m x 88m polyester 
eight plait with a 15m by 68mm sacrificial UHHMPE 
tail. On the aft deck there is a capstan for line-handling 
and a knuckle-boom crane for stores. Ship-handling 
fenders at the bow comprise a cylindrical fender above 
a row of 450mm ‘W’ block fenders. A ‘D’ fender 
provides protection at the main and forecastle deck 
sheer lines, and ‘W’ block type fendering is used again 
at the stern.

S
amson Maritime and Strategic Marine, two 
Western Australian companies, have cooperated to 
set new design and construction standards for two 
multi-million dollar high-speed utility and crew 
vessels built specifically for the Australian offshore 
market.
Fremantle maritime support solutions company 
Samson Maritime ordered the two 40m fast utility 
vessels from Henderson-based Strategic Marine in July 
2008, with the first of the vessels launched in early 
May 2009 at Strategic Marine’s Singapore yard and the 
second vessel launched in August.
Samson Supporter and Samson Supplier have a top 
speed in excess of 25kts, business class seating for 50 
passengers with the ability to increase passenger 
numbers to 100 by the use of a modular interior, 
accommodation for 12 crew members, 120m² of deck 
space, as well as a central deck house.
Some of the unique features of the Samson vessels 
are their use of dynamic positioning to allow the vessel 
to remain on station for extended periods and conduct 
accurate ROV work, and a 1m² moonpool to allow 
hydrographic survey equipment to be deployed in a 
secure housing.
Samson Supporter and Samson Supplier also have an 
A-frame crane installed on the aft of the cargo deck 
and Fi-Fi 1 for fire fighting, including a vessel deluge 
system. Samson Maritime director Jeremy Williams 
said these features were not required by industry 
standard crew boats, meaning the two vessels were 
truly unique.
Williams said: “This brand new design combines the 
best of established maritime design principles with 
leading edge technology. Importantly, these new 
vessels are built to the stringent requirements needed 
to operate them on the Australian coast.
He added: “These boats have the inbuilt flexibility 
to allow them to perform a wide range of both inshore 
and offshore maritime support tasks, including high 
speed supply runs, crew transfer, safety support and 
intervention and inshore and offshore survey tasks.”
Strategic Marine delivered the vessels ahead of 
schedule and within budget. Strategic Marine’s 
Singapore yard is also currently working to complete 
two other 40m utility vessels ordered by Malaysian 
offshore servicing company Dinastia Jati Sdn Bhd in 
September 2008.

S
D Eva is a customized version of the standard 
Damen “Sea Axe” fast crew supplier 3307 (FCS 
3307). Since the first Damen Sea Axe vessel was 
launched at the end of 2006, 23 vessels with this 
remarkable hull form, varying in length between 33m 
and 50m, were sold by Damen. 
The Damen “Sea Axe” Fast Crew Suppliers were 
developed as crew boats or fast suppliers for the 
offshore industry. SD Eva however is an exception. 
This ship will be used for the Royal Navy for 
transferring people to and from submarines, which has 
to be done on open sea.
For this purpose, SD Eva is fitted with a specially 
designed waterline fendering installation and a brow 
for establishing a bridge between SD Eva and a 
submarine.
Diverging from the standard Damen ‘Sea Axe’ Fast 
Crew Supplier design, SD Eva only has two shaft lines 
instead of three, as the required speed of 22kts could 
be reached with only two installations.
SD Eva is part of a large new build order of 29 vessels 
from SD Marine Services to Damen, which when 
introduced into service, will be operated by Serco in 
support of its 15-year PFI contract with the UK 
Ministry of Defence to provide marine support services 
to the Royal Navy.

S
easpan Resolution completed trials and was delivered 
to Seaspan, by builder JM Martinac Shipbuilding 
of Tacoma Washington, six weeks ahead of its 
scheduled delivery on 30 June 2009.
Once in operation this new 6000hp tractor/escort 
tug became the keystone of Seaspan’s ship assist tug 
fleet partnering with Seaspan Discovery and will 
undoubtedly become the escort tug of choice in the 
port. 
Seaspan’s new tug is the third of its class built by JM 
Martinac Shipbuilding with the first two vessels 
delivered last year, being operated by Foss in Puget 
Sound and San Francisco Bay. The design is by local 
Vancouver naval architecture firm, Robert Allan Ltd 
who were also the designers of the Cates 2400 series 
tractors and the Seaspan Hawk and Seaspan Falcon. 
Tractor tugs are now considered the standard 
platform for ship assist work both in harbour and in 
escort, and in the last five years there has been large 
numbers of these vessels built and ordered as 
replacements for the aging, outdated, harbour tug 
fleets worldwide. 
An additional capability now purposely built into 
modern tractor tugs is the ability to produce dynamic-
assist forces, in excess of its rated static bollard pull, to 
a vessel underway. Tugs specifically designed to do this 
are called escort tugs and increasingly they are 
becoming a common part of ship assist services in 
ports and constricted waterways. To do this, new 
tractor designs like the Seaspan Resolution are fitted 
with large fixed skeg keels opposite from the propulsors 
that allow the hull to generate dynamic lift while 
tethered to another ship that is underway. This is done 
almost exactly in the same way a water skier would 
boost their speed, by whipping outside the towboats 
wake and pulling at an angle to the relative direction. 
These forces can be large and so the main winch and 
towing gear have to be capable of anchoring those 
forces. In the case of Seaspan’s new tug, a 250hp 
dynamic escort winch rated at 130tonnes indirect line 
pull performs that job. This new winch also has a 
unique capability, within our fleet, in that it can 
operate in a render recover mode. What that means is 
that the winch can be set to a specific line force pull, if 
the pull on the line exceeds that force the winch will 
automatically slip, paying out line until the pull goes 
below the setting (render) and then winch the line 
back in while under tension (recover). This can be of 
significant benefit when operating in rougher 
conditions where coming up hard on the towline has 
done damage to both tug and assisted vessel in the 
past. 
Purposely designed as a workhorse, Seaspan 
Resolution has also been carefully designed and 
outfitted to be a safe and comfortable vessel for its 
crews with a fully functional galley and mess area on in 
the lower deckhouse complete with a lounge and 
eating area, modern flat screen TV/DVD setup that 
can also display information from ECDIS electronic 
chart plotting system. The deckhouse features a 
separate washroom/shower, first aid room and ship’s 
office. The main diesel engines are resiliently mounted 
to reduce the production of structure based noise and 
large critical grade silencers were squeezed into the 
exhaust casings to reduce on deck noise created by the 
powerful main engines. To further isolate engine room 
noise from the deckhouse and wheelhouse the casings 
are separated from the forward spaces by a breezeway 
corridor athwartships on the main deck. The 
machinery space also is fitted with a large watertight 
door between the Z-drive compartment and the engine 
room making access between the spaces easy and 
efficient. Both the lower deckhouse and the upper 
wheelhouse have independent air conditioning systems 
to provide a comfortable working temperature, even 
on the hottest of days. 
Seaspan Resolution is equipped with Tier II compliant 
main engines and generators, and the generators are 
sized large and small so that in times of low electrical 
demand the smaller engine can be operated. A sewage 
treatment system is also fitted, as is an oily water 
separator unit. To assist in crew access and safety the 
vessel is equipped with bulwark gates for safer and 
easier boarding of the vessel with stores and supplies, 
and a man over board davit and recovery system, now 
standard on Seaspan tractor tugs, as well as life raft 
launching rails and a workboat. Also a first in the 
Seaspan fleet, Seaspan Resolution is fitted with dual 
direction navigation lights so it can operate in either 
direction allowing the ability to tow in a winch aft 
configuration at night.

M
T Seychelles Paradise is part of a concept from 
the Government of the Seychelles to improve 
the maritime infrastructure and to protect the sensitive 
islands against oil pollution and gas accidents. In 
October 2009 Lindenau shipyard delivered Seychelles 
Paradise to Seypec Ltd. 
Lindenau shipyard is a German shipyard well-known 
for the construction of large double-hull tankers 
optimising overall-economy, safety and environmental 
compatibility. These ships have an excellent global 
reputation and have received 14 international awards 
for their excellent qualities (such as in companion 
publication Significant Ships in the years 1997, 1999, 
2005 and 2006). This is the company’s latest move 
into the smaller craft market.
Seypec Ltd. is the national oil and gas company of 
the Seychelles and owns the most modern tanker fleet 
in the Indian Ocean. These ships ensure the domestic 
supply and also participate in the global seaborne 
market for oil and chemicals.
Seychelles Paradise was developed in order to supply 
the Seychelles islands with oil and liquefied gases 
(LPG), to supply foreign vessels with bunker fuel at 
the anchorage of Victoria and to serve as a crew 
training vessel for the education of officers and seamen 
for the national fleet.
The ship has a redundant propulsion plant with 
excellent manoeuvrability, consisting of 2 resiliently 
mounted main engines, 2 controllable pitch propellers, 
2 rudders and a bow thruster. This concept ensures 
unique small turning circles, soft power control and 
maximum safety against casualties. The tactical 
diameter of the turning circle is only 40% of the 
IMO-limit, which is an outstanding performance 
result for a bunker vessel qualified for ship-ship-
berthing.
A double hull surrounds all cargo- and fuel tanks. 
Six epoxy-coated cargo tanks with smooth surfaces 
and four frequency-controlled screw pumps with a 
simultaneous discharge rate of 600m³/h are provided. 
Cargo flow meters, oil spill recovery units, special 
fenders and a manifold crane 5t-16m are supplied for 
bunker service. Furthermore a 102 m³ LPG-plant with 
2 pumps a’ 20m³/h is installed on deck.
Main dimensions and hull form were optimised to 
allow a flexible bunker service with changing drafts 
and slack cargo tanks. High hydrostatic stability was 
required to avoid roll resonance in the Seychelles sea 
(area 69) and to compensate the top-weights of the 
spacious deckhouse and the LPG tanks. Permissible 
bending moments for longitudinal strength are 62% 
above class requirement resulting in a comfortable 
margin for partial load service.
Utmost efforts were invested to minimize fuel 
consumption and any kind of emission. 
More than 20% savings of power demand for 
propulsion and ships service were achieved during the 
optimisation process in the design phase resulting in a 
serious reduction of operation costs during the lifetime 
of the ship.
The slender hull form, computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD)-optimisation of ship lines and shaft inclination, 
low propeller loads (120kg/m²) and a power 
management system contributed to this result.
Integrated computer systems for cargo handling and 
monitoring, engine control and navigation are part of 
the crew training program and minimize the risk of 
human error.
Seychelles Paradise is a trend-setting pilot project in 
respect to safe, ecological and economical transport of 
oil and gas, which will probably be copied for other 
domestic services in the world.

U
nión Naval Valencia (UNV), a member of Boluda 
Shipyards Group (Grupo Boluda) delivered the 
RAstar 3200 class tug, SMBC Monterrey, to its owners 
SMBC in February 2009. 
SMBC Monterrey, which has been built in the Unión 
Naval Valencia installations, will carry out tasks of port 
towing, escort, waste collection, and fire protection. In 
order to do so it has two propulsion units and can attain 
2000rpm, thanks to its two diesel engines. 
SMBC Monterrey is the first of a series of four liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) support escort tugs, expressly designed 
to work at the Costa Azul LNG terminal on the north-
west coast of Mexico, at a terminal exposed to fully 
developed Pacific swells. The basic requirements for the 
tug design stipulated that the tug and its winch must be 
able to sustain a line pull of 75tonnes throughout the 
entire terminal approach in a +2 metre significant swell. 
The resulting winch, described in detail later, is massive 
and extremely powerful; accordingly it dominated every 
aspect of the vessel design. In addition, SMBC required 
that the entire design be less than 500grt, which was a 
challenge to the intended vessel configuration. In order 
to cope with the predominant sea conditions, Robert 
Allan Ltd. chose to utilise the new RAstar hull form for 
best sea-keeping. The 500grt constraint forced some 
minor modifications to that concept, and also forced a 
shortening of the forecastle. 
The tug’s basic hull form reflects the double chine form 
that characterises all Robert Allan Ltd. designs, with a 
sweeping chined stern. A large escort skeg is fitted 
forward which in conjunction with the sponsoned hull 
shape enhances the indirect towing capability and provide 
much enhanced roll stability. 
During sea trials SMBC Monterrey performed 
exceptionally well, achieving a mean bollard pull of 
82.5tonnes.
Low noise levels throughout the accommodation and 
control spaces of the tug are achieved by utilising 
advanced methods of isolating main propulsion 
machinery, as well as high-grade insulation and floating 
floor techniques. 
On of the most distinctive features of this series of tugs 
is the main hawser winch on the fore deck. The most 
obvious difference to a normal ship-handling tug winch 
is the fact that this winch is arranged in a waterfall 
configuration. This solution, proposed by Robert Allan 
Ltd. to the winch manufacturer, put the drums in line, 
making escort operations through a single staple much 
easier. The Markey DESDF-48WF winch fitted is 
claimed by the manufacturer to be the most advanced 
high-performance electric hawser winch in the world. 
This 521kW winch features dual drums each with a 
capacity of 200m of 80mm UHMW-PE soft line for use 
against a bollard pull of 75tonnes. The unit was designed 
to perform close escort service in conditions up to Sea 
State 5 with 3m significant wave height with a 14 second 
wave period. Using Variable-Frequency electric drives, 
dynamic motor braking and water-cooled disc brakes, 
this winch is capable of asymmetric render/recover 
operation that will maintain constant line tension under 
such rough sea conditions. The hawser winch is 
accompanied by a 7.5kW WEPC-14 anchor windlass 
and a 15kW CEP-60 stern capstan also by Markey 
Machinery Co. The aft deck is served by a large H-Bitt 
and a vertical capstan for general line-handling. Ship-
handling fenders at the bow comprise two parallel rows 
of 900 x 450 cylindrical fenders. 350 x 350 hollow "D" 
fenders provide protection at the main and forecastle 
deck sheer lines, and around the stern.
UNV has built the remaining three sister tugs, SMBC 
Tijuana, SMBC Mexicali and SMBC Rosarito and they 
are all operating from their destination port in Ensanada, 
Mexico.

A
stilleros Armon SA successfully delivered escort/
terminal tug Spinola to owner Tug Malta in July 
2009. The €10.7 million (US$14.6 million) tug was 
primarily designed to operate in the Maltese harbours 
and their approaches. The tug is fully equipped with 
Fire-Fighting Class 1, oil recovery and salvage 
equipment, in order to be prepared for any emergency 
that may occur in Maltese waters, or off port in the 
Mediterranean. The vessel is equipped with Voith 
Schneider propulsion and twin MaK main engines 
able to give a total power of 7180bhp, resulting in the 
powerful bollard pull of 80tonnes.
The winch installed on board the tug is a double 
drum in waterfall arrangement, having the upper 
drum for long distance purposes with a drum capacity 
of 1000m steel wire rope. The tug also has a lower 
drum divided into two sections, one for escorting 
purposes (capacity 250m of synthetic rope) and one 
for harbour towing (capacity 150m of synthetic rope). 
The vessel has a clear deck area of around 90m² 
(without the towing staple) or 9m x 10.8m.
Spinola is a near sister to Messico (Armon Hull 651). 
Main differences are a redesign of the aft hull to 
accommodate a stern roller and flush mounted 
Karmoy tow pins and shark jaws. Custom fendering 
allows the vessel to still perform harbour and escort 
duties off the aft main working deck. The escort 
towing staple is removable to maximize aft deck space 
for deck cargo or anchor handling assist work. Deck is 
rated for 5tonnes/m².  
The vessel was delivered to Malta from Spain under 
the command of Capt. Herman Thornton, Tug Malta’s 
Operations Manager and manned by a Maltese crew. 
She will be based in Malta and will carry out both 
harbour towage services and salvage/off port towage 
services. It is believed that Tug Malta intends to apply 
for RINA’s comfort class notations COMF-NOISE C 
and COMF-VIB C, but at the time of writing this 
could not be confirmed.
Spinola is the latest addition to Tug Malta’s present 
fleet of six modern tugs.

S
afehaven Marine, based in Ireland have just 
delivered Spitfire the first of two of its Interceptor 
55 (16.5m) pilot/patrol boats ordered by VT Critical 
services who will be leasing the vessels to the ABP Port 
of Southampton, one of the UK's largest and most 
prestigious ports. They will replace their current old 
Halmatic FRC vessels. 
Safehaven Marine was awarded the contract to build 
the two new vessels against stiff competition from 
other UK and International yards. The first vessel 
Spitfire was delivered just prior to the Seawork 2009 
workboat show in Southampton where she was 
displayed to much acclaim for her fine lines and high 
build quality. 
The two vessels will be used as patrol boats on 
Southampton waters and also as pilot boats alongside 
their existing Nelson 48/50.s. As one of their primary 
roles is providing 24hr cover on Southampton waters 
they are equipped with full live aboard 'hotel facilities' 
and are fitted out to a very high standard, featuring  an 
8,000btu air conditioning unit, a 6.5kW, 1500rpm 
generator providing 240V throughout the vessel, full 
galley facilities with a 240V electric hob, microwave, 
hot and cold water. There is a large, separate heads 
with showering facilities, holding tank and pump out 
facilities. One of the advantages of the Interceptor 
design which has the engines mounted just aft of the 
LCG is the spacious forward accommodation area 
providing twin bunk berths, a large seating area and 
table, full galley with an abundance of locker storage. 
A midships cabin provides 10 individual full height 
crew lockers and storage holds for specialized oil spill 
response equipment the vessel will carry.
Spitfire’s main cabin features a new glass-reinforced 
plastic (GRP) moulding specially developed to suit the 
crews preference for a port side helm position, designed 
to encompass the helmsman with all navigational 
equipment, engine controls and instrumentation 
easily visible and falling quickly to hand providing a 
focused driving environment. Spitfire has a central 
access to the forward accommodation and a crew 
position featuring its own dedicated console to 
starboard.
Behind the helm is a second larger dedicated 
navigation position with a large work top, angled 
instrument console and storage lockers allowing the 
navigator to monitor ship movements with a full paper 
chart assisting navigation throughout Southampton's 
busy waters. Opposite are two pilot seats for when the 
vessel is operating in pilotage duties. At the aft of the 
cabin she features a VIP area with a large, circular 
seating area with a table between to port and a second 
large 'L' shaped settee to starboard, allowing 
comfortable seating for when she is used to carry 
dignitaries. The cabin has been finished 
correspondingly to a high standard with walnut effect 
wood laminate, a teak and holy cabin sole and corian 
effect work tops to provide a high-class ambiance 
throughout.
Spitfire is powered by Scania D16 engines through 
Twin Disc V drive 'Quick Shift' gearboxes which allow 
precise fingertip control of the vessel at slow 
maneuvering speeds, and allow creep speeds of les than 
1kts, an advantage when operating in close quarters 
maneuvers. The vessel has a 25kt max speed at a 
25,000kg displacement.  Scania D16 V8 engines were 
chose due to their compact nature and proven service 
record. Engine removal is facilitated via an large 
opening hatch on the aft deck which is capable of 
being opened for maintenance quickly without 
breaking a silkaflex seal, and will allow the engines to 
be lifted straight out of the craft without the need for 
further lengthwise maneuvering of the engines.
The vessel has a flush aft deck which provides a 
seating area. This has been incorporated in to the 
engine ventilation boxes which also feature emergency 
engine room escape access on one module and storage 
locker space incorporated into the other module. One 
of the vessels roles will be the removal of floating 
flotsam such as trees, pallets and other debris that 
often finds its way into the channel and becomes a 
hazard for boat users. To facilitate this she is fitted 
with a large stainless steel basket that can be lowered 
down 400mm below the surface to recover flotsam.  
In addition the platform doubles as an MOB  
recovery system. The basket is hydraulically operated 
via a stainless steel ram and has a 200kg lifting  
capacity. The aft cockpit area allows the carrying of 
recovered objects to shore.
Her hull design is twin chine deep-V, with a full 
length keel; this gives her a soft ride into head seas, 
tremendous stability running beam on in big seas with 
little rolling and great directional stability downwind. 
She will be fitted with a Safehaven developed ride 
control Interceptor / trim tab system which lowers 
running trim to a wave splitting 1.5 degrees for fast 
head sea work allowing her to punch trough 2m seas at 
20kts. Being able to adjust running trim keeps her 
sharp (55deg deadrise) bow immersed into head seas 
and lifts the bow in following seas preventing her 
burying in to the back of waves. This, coupled with an 
exceptionally low VCG gives her exceptional levels of 
sea keeping. She was delivered by sea by Southampton’s 
crew who were very impressed by her very low noise 
and vibration levels and comfort as well as her 
responsive handling and sea keeping during their 
140nm Irish Sea leg in 2-3m seas.

J
oint stock company shipyard Yantar (hereafter 
referred to as Yantar shipyard) delivered environment 
protection patrol vessel Sprut to the Russian Border 
Guard Service on 10 August 2009.
Sprut is the next development of a series of 
environment protection vessels designed by German 
company Abeking & Rasmussen.
Three partly outfitted hulls with successive building 
numbers (6457, 6458, 6459) which includes Sprut 
(6457) have been built for the German customer by 
Yantar shipyard during 2001 to 2003.
This series of patrol vessels features a displacement 
of 900tonnes and is distinguished by high fuel 
economy due to the use of MTU engines with output 
of 5500kWt. Sprut and the rest of the series can reach 
a high speed of 22kts. The patrol vessel has an 
operational endurance of 30 days and has hull lines 
similar to fishing vessels, giving her the possibility to 
come close to potential poachers and/or trespassers.
Assembly of the vessel’s hull began on 16 June 2003 
and the first vessel was launched at the end of that 
year. The second order for the Russian Border Guard 
Service was laid on the building berth in November 
2004. Four more environment protection vessels of 
the series were then planned.
On 12 October 2007 Yantar shipyard conducted  
the launching ceremony for Sprut. Representatives of 
Frontier Service of Federal Security Service of Russian 
Federation, Concern of Medium and Small 
Shipbuilding (Moscow) and of the government bodies 
of Kaliningrad took part in the ceremony.
Special purpose environment protection patrol vessel 
Sprut, was built in series for Frontier Service of Federal 
Security Service of Russian Federation, and was 
constructed on the grounds of German design, 
finished by FSUE Central Design Bureau ‘Almaz’ 
according to special requirements of Frontier Service 
of the Russian Federation and requirements of Russian 
Ship Register.
Sprut and the rest of the series have already been 
commissioned and are on permanent duty in the 
Baltic Sea. With an endurance of 30 days and 
capability to replace, complement and replenish food 
and water at sea via a helicopter, the ship can perform 
as a floating base for fast patrol craft or a flagship of 
tactical task force.
Sprut is a modern example of the sort of ‘new-
generation’ patrol vessels to come from Russian yards. 
During planning stage this vessel was realised as an 
idea to essentially decrease crew numbers due to the 
application of the most advanced technologies and 
computer-aided facilities onboard. The vessel is 
equipped with diesel-electrical propulsion system and 
one propeller. It considerably increases endurance and 
cruising range of ship. This vessel has automatic engine 
control from main control post.

imek AS has delivered its newbuilding platform 
supply, rescue and standby vessel to Simon Møkster 
Rederi AS in Stavanger, Norway and is designed by 
Havyard Maritime AS, according to type Havyard 832 
CD RS. 
The design is specially adapted to the job as a standby 
safety vessel in the North Sea. After its delivery, Stril 
Mariner changed flag from Norwegian to Faeroese and 
went into a 5-year charter for BP in the southern part of 
the North Sea.
Stril Mariner is the first Havyard designed vessel to be 
delivered from Simek AS and the first vessel built by 
Simek to be delivered to Simon Møkster Shipping. The 
hull for Stril Mariner was built in Gdansk, Poland, as 5 
steel blocks together with the superstructure being block 
no. 6. The blocks were transported to Flekkefjord on a 
barge for assembly in Simek AS’ heated building shed 
after blasting and painting in the separate blast and paint 
hall. The superstructure was assembled separately and 
partly fitted out before lifted on after launching of the 
hull 15 August 2009.
The vessel is divided into watertight compartments 
and has double hull to comply with the Clean Design 
Class and SF for damage stability. Clean Design means 
that no fuel oil or any other liquids that are dangerous to 
the environment are in direct contact with the vessels 
shell. Between the sea and the harmful liquids there is a 
minimum of 760mm, containing sea or fresh water. This 
means that if a minor collision or grounding should 
occur, there will be no spill or danger to the 
environment.
To avoid pollution to the air, the main generators 
exhaust system has been fitted out with a selective 
catalytic reduction (SCR) exhaust gas cleaning system, 
cleaning the environmentally hazardous carbon monoxide 
(CO), nitrogen oxide (NOX) and hydrocarbons (VOC) 
in the exhaust with ammonia, and the nitrogen oxides of 
the exhaust gas becomes environmentally natural 
substances water (H2O) and nitrogen (N2), thus reducing 
the NOX with approx. 90%.
The cargo deck of aft of the superstructure is 714m2, 
and lined with pinewood. On the main deck can be 
carried various deck cargo like pipes, containers, pallets 
etc. to the offshore installations. The cargo deck is 
protected at each side by safe haven with passage on top. 
Aft on main deck and amidship on the safe haven are 
loading and discharge stations, with the connection 
points for the liquid cargoes and bulk hoses. 
Aft on main deck is on starboard side a small house for 
hydraulic central and cargo manifold and various 
equipment. On top is arranged a winch zone where it is 
possible to lift personnel to helicopters, and during oil 
recovery operations, a Transrec oil skimmer is to be 
installed. On main deck are installed container sockets 
for fastening of oil booms and various containerised 
equipment during oil recovery. Oil recovery equipment 
is standardized and stored ashore at various locations 
along the Norwegian coast.
If an accident should occur and a rescue operation is 
necessary, survivors will be taken onboard at the rescue 
zones amidships on each side. On A-deck, each side a 
MOB boat, with 230hp engines and waterjet, make GTC 
7000 FRB, supplied by Mare Safety AS. The boats can do 
a speed of 3kts. Each MOB-boat is launched by davit, 
supplied by TTS Marine AS. Aft of the MOB-boats are 
one deck crane each side, supplied by Hydramarine AS. 
One of the deck cranes operates a Dacon scoop, which 
can take onboard personnel from the sea. 
The bridge deck gives an excellent view for 
manoeuvring the vessel. Forward are installed all the 
latest nautical equipment needed while steaming, sitting 
in the captain's chair supplied by Sørlandets Aluminium 
Produkter AS. Aft is another captain's chair within easy 
reach of the manoeuvre handles necessary for operating 
the vessel with the stern to the rig, discharging liquids 
and bulk and deck cargo. Discharge of liquids and dry 
bulk are monitored from the aft command via the 
Havyard IAS, Integrated Automation System, pump and 
valve control system supplied by Havyard International 
AS. On the bridge is the Rolls-Royce Marine AS supplied 
PosCon joystick system installed. Stril Mariner is also 
fitted out with a dynamic position, DP2, system of 
Rolls-Royce Marine AS make, type ICON DP2.

S
vitzer Kilroom was delivered from Freire shipyard in 
December 2008 to her owner at the Dragon LNG 
terminal in Milford Haven, UK. 
Svitzer Kilroom is the largest and most powerful of the 
‘RAstar’ series of tugs designed by Robert Allan Ltd for 
this major terminal operation. This ‘RAstar 3900’ class 
tug completed trials in early December 2008. In 
addition to this 39m tug, a series of five smaller near-
sisters, the ‘RAstar 3400’ class tugs are also being built 
by Freire for this demanding service.
Svitzer Kilroom is equipped for typical ship-handling 
and escort work, with a Rolls-Royce model TW 
3000/1000H single drum hawser winch on the fore 
deck, with a capacity for 250m of 76mm diameter high 
strength towline. The escort-rated winch is driven by a 
twin-pump electro-hydraulic pump set, and features a 
three speed drive system, capable of line recovery at 100 
tonne line pull at 5.2m/min or of rendering at 
150tonnes at 8m/min in the first speed range, or of 
recovering at 24tonnes at 18m/min and rendering at 
50tonnes line pull at 28m/min in the third speed range. 
The aft deck is strengthened for an aft towing winch, 
but that is not presently fitted.
In common with the majority of Robert Allan Ltd. 
designed tugs, a great deal of attention was paid 
throughout the design process to mitigate the 
propagation of noise and vibration. This includes the 
essential resilient mounting of the main engines, 
isolation of all exhaust system components, and the 
extensive use of visco-elastic floating floor systems 
throughout. The shipyard executed all these 
requirements exceptionally well, and the reward was an 
extremely quiet ship throughout.
Svitzer Kilroom is built in accordance with Lloyd's 
Register of Shipping requirements for a 100A1 Escort 
Tug, Fire Fighting Ship 1 (2400m³/hr) with water spray, 
LMC, UMS, 1BS, NAV1 notation, and also in 
compliance with the UK MCA regulations. The fire-
fighting capability is provided by a pair of main-engine 
driven pumps, each rated 1400m³ cubic meters per 
hour, which serve a pair of Kvaerner water/foam 
monitors and a self-protection waterspray system. Main 
engines are a pair of General Electric 7FDM 16 diesels 
developing 3050kW each at 1050rpm at 100% MCR. 
These are coupled to Schottel SRP 3030 CP azimuthing 
thrusters. 
Svitzer Kilroom successfully completed trials in 
Spanish waters, delivering performance beyond all 
expectations during trials with a bollard pull of 
117tonnes maximum and 113tonnes sustained ahead 
and 113/107tonnes astern maximum / sustained. Free 
running speed ahead was 15.7kts. The ‘RAstar’ design 
hull form incorporates a significant sponson on the 
upper hull sides. When the tug is heeled over under 
influence of the towline during an escort operation, the 
‘downhill’ sponson is submerged and a large righting 
force is generated to improve the stability, thus 
increasing the towline force. In addition, the hull has a 
large foil-shaped skeg, also designed to increase indirect 
towline forces. The ‘RAstar’ hull form also provides 
dramatic reductions in roll amplitude and roll 
accelerations, thus providing a safer and more 
comfortable platform for crews, who are now being 
asked to conduct docking operations at LNG terminals 
and similar installations in up to sea-states of 3.0m 
significant wave heights.
Svitzer Kilroom also features low noise levels in the 
deck levels and cabins. The recorded noise levels are as 
follows:
• Bridge Deck: Wheelhouse	
65 dBA
• Main Deck: Galley	
64 dBA
Mess/Lounge	
64 dBA
• Master's Cabin	
	
58 dBA
• Chief Engineer Cabin	 60 dBA
• Lower Deck:
Engine Room	
110 dBA
MCR	
74 dBA
• Crew cabins	
58-60 dBA
Svitzer Kilroom has numerous features for operating 
in LNG service including; such as gas sensors, the 
ability to positively pressurise accommodation and deck 
electrical equipment either safety rated or has ability to 
be de-energised from bridge.
The fire-fighting capability is provided by a pair of 
main-engine driven pumps, each rated 1400m³/h, 
which serve a pair of Kvaerner water/foam monitors 
and a self-protection waterspray system.

S
hipyard Hijos de J Barreras of Vigo, Spain 
(hereafter Barreras shipyard) delivered 3D, 
12-streamer seismic vessel WG Columbus to company 
WesternGeco after the trial period she was subjected 
to. This is the first one of a series of four vessels that 
WesternGeco has ordered from the shipyard. WG 
Columbus is the first seismic vessel built outside 
Ulstein Verft to feature Ulstein’s X-bow shape.
WG Columbus is also the first seismic vessel with 
inverted bow shape ever to be built in Spain, and 
therefore is another milestone in the field of innovation 
and new technologies for shipyard Barreras. This vessel 
– which is of great technical complexity and very high 
added value, undoubtedly means the consolidation of 
the shipyard within a very competitive and highly 
committed to environmental protection offshore 
market.
The seismic vessel contains state-of-the-art 
equipment, and the vessel has advanced dynamic 
positioning equipment. The diesel/electric propelling 
plant has been specially designed to make the fast-
response compatible with smooth movements of the 
vessel. It has six main generator sets of 1719kW each 
consisting of a 1000rpm, 1800kW diesel engine. WG 
Columbus has a heliport and accommodation space for 
69 people. The vessel was built in compliance with the 
regulations and under special monitoring by DNV, in 
order to achieve level 1A1 SF, EO, DYNPOS-
AUTR, CLEAN DESING, COMF-V839, ICE-C, 
NAUT-AW, and HELDK.
WG Columbus is currently in operation in the Gulf 
of Mexico carrying out seismic operations. Ship owner 
WesternGeco, a business unit of Schlumberger Group, 
is the world's leading geophysical services company. 
This vessel and the three twin ones that have either 
been built or are currently under construction at 
shipyard Barreras are designed to prospect oilfields in 
any place in the world, studying the extraction 
feasibility of such whether gas or hydrocarbon fields 
–as regards both quantity and quality.
WG Columbus, which is 88.8m loa and 19m beam, 
is the result of a technically very advanced project –the 
Ulstein SX124, carried out in close collaboration 
between Barreras shipyard’s technical department, the 
ship owner and Norwegian company Ulstein Design.

F
ire-fighting escort tug, Willy T, was constructed 
by Astilleros Zamakona Pasaia for operations in 
the harbour of Barcelona, Spain. The vessel’s main 
duties are port manoeuvres and towage, and 
additionally high sea towage when required. Due to 
the specific design by Seacor, the thrusters are 
located diagonally opposite one another. This ensures 
excellent manoeuvrability, and along with the flat 
bottom, a bollard pull of 78tonnes is achieved.
The vessel is equipped with a marine control drive 
(MCD) from Twin Disc to allow Fi-Fi operation. 
Fi-Fi and water spraying is performed via two pumps 
of 1356m³/h each. Water is directed by two monitors 
and the water spraying circuit. Regarding Fi-Fi 
capabilities, the vessel’s internal design includes a 
foam tank (4.8m³). Dispersant booms are also 
deployable for pollution control.
To reduce operation of the gensets when the vessel 
is on standby, either in the harbour or outside waiting 
for a vessel, solar panels supply the vessel with the 
basic power required. Once in operation at least one 
of the gensets is initialised.
The deck machinery has been supplied by Carral. 
The fendering system is from Schyler, manufactured 
with second-hand tyres on one hand, plus classical 
fenders from Norrubber. Kongsberg has supplied the 
station-keeping gear.
