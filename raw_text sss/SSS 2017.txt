W
hile cable and chain ferry orders may 
seem something of a rarity these days, 
gaps in national road infrastructures – as well as 
congested or restricted road routes – mean that 
demand for these low-cost, low-tech ‘bridges 
with hulls’ has not gone completely.  In May 
2017, the British Columbia (BC) Ministry of 
Transportation, Canada took delivery of the 
first of four new double-ended cable ferries, 
intended to service the remote waters of Adams 
Lake, the second deepest lake in BC. Located far 
from the region’s tourist trail, these vessels will 
provide a means for local commuters to safely 
cross points of the lake by automobile. 
Adams Lake II  is the brainchild of Capilano 
Maritime Design Ltd, a North Vancouver-based 
naval architecture and marine engineering firm 
which has been contracted to design all four 
cable ferries. The first-in-series unit was 
constructed in modular fashion at steel ferry 
specialist WaterBridge Steel Inc, also of BC.  The 
ferry now offers a round-the-clock, ‘on demand’ 
service for motorists, covering a short-hop route 
of approximately 800m within six minutes, end 
to end. 
At the time of delivery, Richard Wagner, 
project manager for Capilano Maritime Design’s 
cable ferry newbuilds, told Ship & Boat 
International: “The overall design itself wasn’t 
too challenging – it’s essentially a barge hull 
form with a cable-driven system.” The tricky 
part was assessing and addressing the tension of 
the wire rope cable, which was forming a 
catenary at the bottom of the lake – a task that 
necessitated paying careful attention to the 
ferry’s trawler winch. 
Adams Lake II is connected to two shore-
based anchors on each end of the route, and has 
been designed to run on three cables. Two 
cables are used as directional guides and one is 
used by the two-wheel hydraulic traction 
winch, located inside the machinery room, to 
move the vessel. The ferry is powered by a 
single John Deere 4045 AFM 4-cylinder diesel 
engine, rated 110kW and generating a speed of 
4.5knots, while two 36” bull wheels pull the 
vessel along on the cable. Added to this, an 
onboard fuel capacity of 6,500litres permits 
Adams Lake II to handle periods of peak 
demand and continuous traffic throughout the 
day, before requiring refuelling. 
Wagner added: “The vessel can accommodate up 
to 48 passengers seated in 10 cars. The ferry has a 
rather simple layout: for instance, there is no 
standing room, nor washroom facilities, but this is 
a very short trip. She can carry any vehicle that is 
road-legal in BC, including Tridem-drive vehicles.” 
The vessel has a maximum load capacity of 
34tonnes and has been classed by Lloyd’s Register, 
in addition to meeting Transport Canada’s 
requirements for inland passenger vessels. 
WaterBridge Steel will construct all four 
Capilano-designed cable ferries in the order, and 
is currently on track to deliver the second ferry, 
a sister to the first, to the BC Ministry of 
Transportation in early 2018. The remaining 
two, to be delivered in 2019 and 2020, will be 
47m in length.

avAlt’s 75-pax solar passenger ferry 
Aditya, hailed as India’s first vessel of this 
type, was ordered by the Kerala State Water 
Transport Department (SWTD), which is eager 
to invest in diesel-free transport solutions for 
the country’s backwaters – not just for the 
significant reduction in pollution risk, but 
because such solutions are economically viable. 
The ferry marries a GRP cataman hull to an 
aluminium superstructure, while pholtovoltaic 
panels are positioned on the ferry’s roof. These 
panels convert solar energy into electricity, to 
be stored within the vessel’s 50kWh lithium ion 
(Li-ion) battery bank, comprising two 25kWh 
packs supplied by AltEn and EVE. The batteries 
then feed two 20kWh AC motors.
In sunny weather, NavAlt estimates that the 
ferry can expect a range of approximately 6 
hours when travelling at a cruise speed of 
5.5knots. Cloudier days could see this range 
limited to 4.5 hours, although secondary 
charging at the dock will remain an option. At 
night time, range decreases to 2.5 hours. 
Maximum speed has been calculated at 
7.5knots.
Obvious benefits include negligible risk of 
pollution and freedom from the stink of petrol 
/diesel fumes, which can impact on crew and 
passenger health. 
However, focusing on the cost element, and how 
this stacks up against that of a conventional, diesel-
powered, steel ferry, reveals some interesting 
findings too. While there may be a greater upfront 
investment for the solar ferry – approximately 
INR25,000,000 (US$373,000), compared to a 
spend of INR15,000,000 (US$223,000) – in terms 
of running costs,  NavAlt has calculated that the 
solar ferry will require an annual investment of just 
US$2,240, which contrasts favourably to the 
US$44,790 which the average diesel ferry guzzles 
in a year. This could easily result in the Kerala 
SWTD realising a return on its investment in less 
than five years.
A diesel ferry will trump its solar equivalent in 
range; size for size, the average diesel tank will 
permit a range of 250km, compared to the solar 
ferry’s 85km. However, if one’s remit reflects short-
hop services rather than lengthy coastal journeys, 
the drawbacks of solar ferries tend to end there. 
Other advantages include sub-60dB noise levels, 
in comparison to a typical diesel ferry’s 80-90dB 
range, and a sizeable saving in weight; from 
45tonnes to 24tonnes at full load, when one swaps 
the diesel tanks for battery packs. 
From an environmentalist’s point of view, 
though, a different set of figures make Aditya an 
enticing proposition. On an annual basis, the 
Kerala SWTD can expect to save 52,500litres of 
diesel and reduce local CO₂ emissions by 
approximately 140-160tonnes.

espite the offshore downturn of the past few 
years, oil and energy platform maintenance 
remains an ongoing concern for some companies, 
and demand remains for vessels that can transfer 
offshore personnel and technicians from shore or 
ship to these fixed, deep-water structures – as 
well as ensuring their safety and being ready to 
swing into action in the case of an emergency. 
The Alusafe 1200 TWJ fast rescue daughter craft 
(FRDC) is a case in point. This vessel was designed 
and constructed to comply with ERRV guidelines 
and UK MCA regulations for such vessels, as well 
as with the Norwegian Maritime Directorate’s 
(NMD’s) and SOLAS requirements for fast rescue 
craft with exemptions, giving it a broad potential 
scope of operational areas. 
The hull has a deep-vee form, which is suitable 
for high-speed operations, and which has been 
fashioned from marine grade aluminium. The 
GRP superstructure, meanwhile, provides shelter 
for six people, while the boat’s twin inboard jet 
system provides a high degree of manoeuvrability 
in rough weather conditions. The core vessel is 
customisable, however: customers can select 
alternative propulsion systems if so required. 
The Alusafe 1200 TWJ FRDC also incorporates a 
number of new features, compared to previous 
Maritime Partner builds. For instance, the 
company says, this new class features: a larger 
recess for roof hook attachment; wider cabin space, 
with more height in the front cabin; a flush work 
deck; and higher freeboard. Additionally, the 
canopy to the fore provides an ideal access spot for 
the painter release hook system. If opting for Volvo 
Penta engines, there is also the opportunity to 
incorporate a touch screen for navigational and 
engine control.

s well as providing a means for anchor-
handling operations in rough weather, the 
1,526gt Antarctic has been tasked with standby 
rescue duties and cargo transportation runs, the 
latter including loads ranging from fresh and 
black water and fuel oil to liquid mud and 
cement. Built by the Atlas Shipyard in Turkey, to 
a blueprint provided by Offshore Ship Designers 
(OSD), the 1,526gt Antarctic was developed with 
a design draught of 3.8m, though, at time of her 
delivery, OSD commented: “The minimum 
draught, in a light operating condition, of 
approximately 2.5m facilitates access to the 
shallower parts of the Caspian Sea.” 
Antarctic’s beam, meanwhile, is intended to 
enhance her stability at sea, offering a platform-
type environment for crew. The vessel has been 
fitted with 10 cabins and can accommodate 13 
crew members and eight passengers during 
‘typical’, non-recovery/-rescue operations. 
As the vessel is bound to encounter ice – which 
can prove 800mm-thick during the winter season 
– Antarctic has been accredited with Bureau 
Veritas’ Ice Class 1A notation, in addition to: 
Special Service-Standby Rescue Vessel notation, 
in recognition of her ability to accommodate 100 
survivors (replete with adequate sanitary 
facilities); Fi-Fi 1, deploying water; and Dynapos 
AM/AT, thanks to her dynamic positioning 1 
(DP1) system.
Meanwhile, to withstand the accompanying 
cold temperatures within this region, Antarctic's 
hull has been fashioned from special-grade steel 
capable of withstanding temperatures as low as 
-30⁰C, OSD says. 
Antarctic also features 450m² of combined deck 
space, strengthened to 10tonnes per m², thereby 
enabling crew to store up to 250tonnes of cargo 
on the deck. A Heila HLRM 200/18-4SL crane, 
featuring a SWL of 6tonnes at an outreach of 
18m, provides the means of transferring cargo to 
and from the deck. Cargotec, meanwhile, 
provided Antarctic’s winch and stern roller. 
As befits her tough operating environment, the 
AHTS vessel has been kitted out for raw power, 
featuring no fewer than three Cummins engines, 
each rated 1,864kW at 1,800rpm, driving a trio of 
2,100mm-diameter, nozzled Caterpillar 
propellers through Reintjes gearboxes. As well as 
providing a high degree of manoeuvrability and a 
service/top speed of 12knots, this arrangement 
also grants Antarctic a bollard pull ranking of 
70knots. The vessel also incorporates six rudders, 
manufactured by Gurdesan, steering gear from 
Data Hidrolik and a Caterpillar bow thruster, 
rated 370kW.

arch saw Peru take delivery of a versatile 
research vessel with core oceanographic 
and polar-going capabilities, built in northwest 
Spain by Construcciones Navales P.Freire. The 
95m BAP Carrasco has been taken on by the 
Peruvian Navy to undertake tasks such as 
hydrographic, 
biological, 
geological 
and 
physiochemical surveys, plus search and rescue 
(SAR), oil spill and disaster support.
The vessel is also able to undertake Antarctic 
base re-supply and expeditionary voyages during 
the summer months. 
Norwegian technical consultancy Skipsteknisk’s 
ST-344 design provided the template for the 
Peruvian ship. BAP Carrasco has been outfitted 
and prepared for a number of tasks, including: 
single and multi-beam echosounder surveys; 
integrated data logging; multidisciplinary science 
projects; seismic investigations;  clean seawater 
sampling; ROV operations;  conductivity, 
temperature and depth(CTD) surveys;  and also 
deepwater coring, trawling and towing. 
Six research laboratories, a meteorological 
office and a bathymetry conducer system are 
situated on the underside of the hull bottom, 
radiating a multiplicity of acoustic beams to map 
the sea floor and deliver data to the vessel in real-
time. BAP Carrasco has been developed to 
withstand temperatures of -25°C and to navigate 
in up to 1m of ice coverage. 
The prime movers for the four 2,250kWe main 
diesel gensets are Caterpillar 3516C engines, and 
electric drive is transformed into propulsive 
thrust by way of two 3,000kW Rolls-Royce AZP 
120 Azipull units, incorporating controllable-
pitch propellers. The installation provides for a 
maximum, open-water speed of around 16knots 
and is augmented by two 800kW tunnel thrusters 
in the bow, also of Rolls-Royce make. Nitrogen 
oxide (NOx) emissions are curtailed by selective 
catalytic reduction (SCR) plant, using urea as the 
treatment medium. 
The diesel-electric mode has long been favoured for 
survey and research vessel applications, as it offers the 
requisite operating flexibility and much reduced 
noise and vibration, relative to other propulsion 
options. Quiet operation is paramount to such ships 
so as to avoid distortions in survey readings, and has 
the added benefit of improving habitability for crew 
and for the large number of research scientists and 
technicians carried. The standard achieved with the 
installation aboard BAP Carrasco was key to meeting 
DNV GL’s criteria for its Silent-A class notation. 
Kongsberg Maritime delivered the ship’s integrated 
subsea technology systems package. The scope of 
supply included multi-beam and single-beam 
echosounders for hydrographic work, a sub-bottom 
profiler for geophysical tasks and single-beam, multi-
frequency echosounders for biology-related studies, 
plus two Hugin autonomous underwater vehicles 
(AUVs) configured for hydrography, geology and 
geophysics. 
Deployed from the stern, the torpedo-shaped 
AUVs are rated to conduct high-resolution surveys at 
depths down to 3,000m. The vessel also carries a 
Falcon DR ROV, which can reach a depth of 1,000m 
for survey assignments.  
BAP Carrasco embodies a moon pool in the centre 
of the ship, enabling sensitive equipment to be 
lowered and recovered in all weather conditions. A 
hangar arranged on the vessel’s starboard side houses 
a CTD instrument to sample the seawater column at 
different depths, using a steel-clad data cable of 
5,000m length. A helicopter landing pad, 
indispensable to operations in harsh, high latitudes, is 
positioned over the aft deck section.

epresenting a “synergy of some of the most 
prominent technologies found in the marine 
industry today”, according to builder Cheoy Lee, 
the Bravo 72 motoryacht class was developed 
with the intention of raising the bar for fuel-
efficient boating. 
To achieve this, the builder opted for a weight-
saving approach, to result in a light yacht. From the 
hull to the finished interior, all materials have been 
weight-optimised via advanced engineering. Her 
panels and decks have been strengthened with 
lightweight cores to maintain rigidity, while her 
“substantial-looking stone surfaces are…
painstakingly shaved to a fraction of an inch 
[25.4mm] thick and honeycomb-backed for 
strength and lightness”, Cheoy Lee adds. 
In turn, naval architect Howard Apollonio has 
based the Bravo 72 on a double-chine hull. 
Structural design analysis of the yacht was based 
on class society Det Norske Veritas’ (DNV’s) Rules 
for the Classification of High Speed, Light Craft 
and Naval Surface Craft, 2014. 
This process was handled by Gurit Ltd, which 
explains: “This analysis utilised load cases and 
design allowables obtained from the DNV rule. 
The main purpose and aim of using a more 
sophisticated analysis and direct calculation 
method was to remove some of the assumptions 
and conservatism in the scantling calculations, and 
to better understand, optimise and determine a 
structure that would meet the DNV determined 
loads with sufficient strength. 
“To this, we added additional checks and targets 
based around the type of boat and its intended 
use.” Gurit used Altair Hyperworks to carry out 
finite element analysis (FEA), along with its 
in-house-developed scantling software, to create a 
custom framework for the Bravo 72. The company 
explains: “Geometry effects such as stiffness from 
form or curvature which aid the structures were 
identified, and, likewise, details that cause high 
localised stresses or higher deflections were easily 
identified and eliminated with specific and 
targeted patching.” 
For enhanced operational efficiency, directional 
thrust and manoeuvrability, the Bravo 72 relies on 
Volvo IPS drives: two counter-rotating propellers 
have been placed on each drive leg. The boat also 
incorporates Volvo’s joystick controls, enabling 
“fingertip docking”, and permitting crew to take 
advantage of dynamic positioning, joystick driving 
and cruise control functionalities.

P
rimarily aimed at coast guard, law 
enforcement agency and naval clients, the 
Carson Interceptor range of RIBs, the first of 
which was delivered in April 2017, comes in 
three custom sizes, their common bond being a 
commitment to combining excellent sea-
keeping with the capability for breakneck speed. 
A demonstrator version of the 950 model – the 
largest in the series, so far – occupied Probond 
Marine’s slot on the jetty during Seawork 2017 
(other models include the 7.5m 750 and 8.5m 
850). Although, unfortunately, the 950 was not 
providing waterborne demonstrations, a glance 
at her outboard motor arrangement, comprising 
three 224kW Mercury Verado units, gave a good 
indication of her power and potential pace. In 
fact, that configuration is sufficient to grant the 
RIB a top speed in excess of 70knots, without 
sacrificing stability in harsh weather. The 950 is 
also capable of taking three 298kW outboards.  
What especially makes the Interceptor range 
unique is that it can also be configured with 
three inboard engines, two aft and one 
midships forward, with the centre engine 
feeding a waterjet. This is an unusual 
arrangement, given that all RIBs in the 
Interceptor series are built upon a stepped 
hull form. 
Stepped hull forms are usually highly 
effective in reducing vessel drag, but the steps 
do lead to a significant amount of aeration 
which can interfere with waterjet efficiency. As 
such, stepped hulls and waterjets seldom, if 
ever, feature on the same craft. However, the 
Interceptor’s deep-vee, stepped hull form is in 
itself unique, designer Barry Carson explained. 
The hull features what Carson has christened 
“delta steps”: these are U-shaped steps, pointing 
aft, which have been situated centre-forward. 
As these steps progress aft, towards the vessel 
centreline, they “fade”, or recede into the hull 
before they get to the keel line. Thus, the keel 
line is straight, continuous and unbroken, 
unlike other stepped hulls.
This design is said to have two key benefits: 
firstly, these produce less aeration in the after 
sections along the centreline right where the jet 
intake would be positioned, so the craft can 
take advantage of the ‘best of both worlds’ – 
reduced drag from the steps and extra kick 
from the waterjets – to achieve high speeds and 
manoeuvrability. As an example, Carson 
highlighted: “When the crew are in loitering 
mode, they can solely utilise the waterjet. This 
not only provides them with a quiet means of 
propulsion when they are undertaking covert 
coastal surveillance missions, but means they 
can take the vessel into very shallow waters, 
where there may be more debris present.” 
Secondly, the receding nature of the steps 
makes it easier to launch the Interceptor from 
trailers and shallow-water environments and/
or for the vessel to experience beaching and 
grounding, “where otherwise the steps may 
sink into and become embedded in the sand or 
soil, or dig into the ground and impede 
movement,” Carson said. 
From the mid-section of the hull forward, the 
Interceptor also incorporates a “vertical stem”-
style design, perhaps more common as a staple 
of yacht design than as standard RIB feature. 
A fine semi-wave-piercing  bow enables the 
RIB to slice through moderately sized waves, 
adding another layer of stability to the boat 
whilst freeing up crew to undertake high-speed 
interdiction missions without fear of excessive 
pitching. The Carson Interceptor also features 
broad spray rails beginning from the stem, for a 
drier ride. 
In terms of range, the Interceptor has a fuel 
capacity of 1,000litres, although up to 
2,000litres could be stored in total below deck. 
This helps grant the vessel an impressive range 
in excess of 1,000nm at cruising speeds, he 
added. 
Beyond the basics, the Interceptor range is 
fully customisable and can be tailored to each 
client’s individual needs. For example, the 
demonstrator version of the 950, as displayed at 
Seawork, was fitted with Ullman Dynamics’ 
Echelon shock mitigation seats, which were 
developed specifically for small, high-speed 
boats and provide lateral support for 
personnel’s legs, hips and torsos. However, 
buyers have the opportunity to specify a cabin 
version, complete with beds for the crews and 
toilet/cooking facilities, making the RIB 
suitable for extended missions.

ithmarschen is the first of two 28m pilot boats 
built and designed by Dockstavarvet for the 
German Generaldirektion Wasserstrassen und 
Schifffahrt. Her steel hull was designed with hard 
chines, a full-length skeg, bulb stem and square 
transom, and built by Riga Shipyard, while the 
aluminium deckhouse was handled by Aluspec. 
Her sister vessel, currently under construction, is 
scheduled for delivery in May 2018. 
Dithmarschen is reportedly the first vessel to be 
built in Sweden according to the harmonised EU 
Rules for Inland Navigation, and she has been 
classed by the Swedish Transport Board through 
DNV GL for Zone 2. After transfer to Germany, 
under the Swedish flag, the vessel went through  
additional 
approvals 
by 
Zentrale 
Schiffsuntersuchungskommission (ZSUK) for the 
extended operational area, Zone 2 See. 
When operating in fully laden mode, 
Dithmarschen is able to achieve a top speed of 
14.3knots. Dockstavarvet says: “At 50% output, the 
speed is still well over 12knots, giving a fuel 
consumption of less than 10litres per nm.” The 
vessel’s fuel capacity, 12,000litres, is sufficient for 
one week of operation. 
The boat’s fender system comprises 400mm and 
500mm cylindrical fenders at deck level and 
200mm x 250mm D-fenders on the side. A pilot 
platform – installed forward of midships, 1.4m 
over the deck level – is fitted with a hydraulic drive 
and can be pushed out in line with the fender 
system to both sides. Dockstavarvet adds: “For 
transfer of pilots to ships with low freeboards, 
there are side niches to port and starboard with the 
deck level only 0.5m over the waterline.” Other 
deck equipment includes a rescue davit and MOB 
recovery system, port side.
All accommodation is situated aft of midships. 
Below deck, one finds the crew mess, while the 
deckhouse contains a pilot saloon with nine seats 
and the wheelhouse – the latter featuring two 
control stations, one in each side, both equipped 
with “complete and redundant” navigation and 
communication systems. Most of the deck and 
interior lighting is provided by LED lights.

uilt at Astilleros Gondán’s yard in Spain, the dual-fuel 
tug Dux represents the first in Robert Allan Limited 
(RAL)’s RAstar 4000-DF dual-fuel LNG/diesel escort tug 
class, specifically designed for operations at Statoil’s 
Melkøya LNG terminal at Hammerfest, Norway, where 
temperatures can easily plummet to -8⁰C or lower.
In addition to her escort tug duties, the 40.2m loa, 
steel vessel has also been equipped to undertake 
firefighting and oil spill clean-up duties, in 
temperatures as low as -20°C. 
The power arrangement aboard Dux comprises two 
Wärtsilä 6L34 dual-fuel (DF) main engines, rated 
3,000kW apiece, and Wärtsilä’s integrated LNGPac gas 
handling system. Based on an IMO Type C LNG storage 
tank (as most commonly used aboard small-to-medium-
sized hybrid or LNG-powered ferries and offshore 
support vessels), the LNGPac is a vacuum-isolated tank 
which, in Dux’s case, can be accessed via the engine room 
via an A-60-rated watertight door. 
The LNGPac contains a tank connection space (TCS) 
within the LNG tank hold, and this TCS contains: liquid 
and vapour LNG tank connections; a pressure build-up 
evaporator (PBE), which builds up and maintains 
adequate pressure within the tank (approximately 5bar, 
Wärtsilä claims); a main gas evaporator; and a gas valve 
unit (GVU) for each tank. Wärtsilä says: “By combining 
the LNGPac and the GVU into a single system, 
considerable space can be saved… [as can] installation 
time and costs for the yard.” RAL adds: “The TCS is 
accessed from within the tank hold by an air lock, which 
is integrated with the TCS and is supplied as part of the 
LNGPac system.” 
The LNG bunker station is located on Dux’s main 
deck, and bunkering can be conducted either from 
bunkering barge-to-ship or from a quayside tank truck. 
To protect the hull from any cryogenic damage that 
might result from spilled LNG, the LNG bunker station 
has been fitted with a foldable drip tray and features 
provisions for water flushing. 
Whilst assessing Dux’s needs, one particular challenge 
concerned the vessel’s vent mast. Typically, LNG-fuelled 
vessels release small quantities of gas as a natural result of 
pressure build-up, commonly via pressure relief valves 
and ‘block and bleed’ piping valves. The onboard vent 
mast, therefore, provides an outlet for these emissions and 
a means of dispelling natural gas into the atmosphere. 
Obviously, for safety reasons, it is strongly recommended 
that the vent mast is not located near  potential sources of 
ignition (such as engine exhaust outlets). Under the terms 
of the International Code for Ships using Gases and other 
Low Flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code), which applies to all 
vessels of more than 500gt and deploying LNG fuel 
systems, the vent mast should be positioned at a distance 
of 10m from such sources of ignition. 
Given the RAstar 4000-DF’s 40.2m length, this 
recommended distance would be rather difficult to 
guarantee. Not only that but, in relation to the tug’s size, 
the vent mast would have to feature a low profile so as not 
to impact on ship-handling and manoeuvrability.  
Instead of deploying a conventional vent mast, therefore, 
RAL produced what it describes as “a unique double-wall 
vent mast”. The architect says: “Ventilation air forced 
through the outer annulus mixes with any vented gas 
carried by the inner pipe at the outlet. The resulting 
mixture is carried safely away by the ventilation air flow.” 
Additionally, noise has been reduced to just 56dBA on 
the bridge and to 50.8dBA in the mess/galley area and 
50dBA in the master’s cabin. Crew members sleeping in 
the four cabins situated on the lower deck get an even 
better deal, with noise levels restricted to 45-47dBA in 
these quarters. The machinery control room also 
manages to reduce noise levels to a respectable 73dBA – 
certainly loud but, arguably, not unbearably so, given that 
room’s function. 
Dux has been reinforced with a 1,000mm-diameter 
cylindrical fender extending well aft along with a lower 
course of 400mm-thick W-fender, designed to limit 
fender contact pressures to 20tonnes per m².  Sheer 
fendering comprises 400mm x 400mm D-fender, while 
the stern is protected by a 400mm-thick W-fender.
Dux’s firefighting system can throw water at 2.4 million 
litres per hour over distances of more than 120m. The 
arrangement includes two Eureka pumps, rated 1.5 
million litres per hour, driven off the front of the main 
engines via Kumera gearboxes, and Jason monitors rated 
1.2 million litres per hour for water and 300,000litres per 
hour for foam.

elivered to HADAG, which provides 
scheduled boat services around the ports of 
Hamburg, Germany, the prototype version of 
the new HADAG Type 2020 ferry class, 
Elbphilharmonie, 
was 
designed 
with 
environmental efficiency in mind, featuring not 
only a hybrid diesel-electric drive but also an 
optimised hull form: the latter designed for 
minimal resistance, to improve fuel efficiency. 
The ferry is almost 30m long and offers space 
for 400 passengers, with 154 seats on the 
passenger deck and an additional 88 seats 
located upstairs, on the sun deck. Additionally, 
Elbphilharmonie features a kiosk and storage 
space for bicycles, taking advantage of the fact 
that she boasts more space than her Type 2000 
predecessors, courtesy of her wider beam. This 
enhanced breadth also makes it easier for 
disabled passengers to move around the vessel 
and has led to a reported 60% increase in 
seating capacity. 
The prototype vessel has been equipped with a 
modern, energy-efficient, clean diesel-electric 
propulsion system. Her two diesel engines, 
provided by Scania, generate the power to feed the 
electric EcoProp system, which was manufactured 
by Siemens. The electric propulsion engines power 
a pair of propellers designed by Schaffran, 
combined with rudders from Van der Velden, for 
enhanced manoeuvrability. Pella Sietas, which 
built and co-designed the vessel, explains: “This 
propulsion system set-up allows a sustainable 
system, ready for future technologies like advanced 
batteries or other future energy storage devices.”
Meanwhile, as another concession to 
environmental protection – and, chiefly, to curb 
harmful exhaust gas emissions – Elbphilharmonie 
has been fitted with both diesel particulate filter 
(DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) 
technology.

inFerries’ newbuilding Elektra represents 
Finland’s first battery-fuelled hybrid ferry, and 
thus a milestone on the path towards clean 
shipping. Built by Crist S.A. in Poland, Elektra 
began operations in summer 2017, traversing a 
1.6km route in the Finnish Archipelago. The 
hybrid ferry provides a glimpse of a greener future 
for state-owned operator FinFerries, which carries 
approximately 4 million vehicles and 10 million 
passengers on its 43 routes  around the country.
Elektra’s battery packs are charged directly from 
the grid and diesel electricity generators used 
alongside them as a backup serve as the energy 
source for the new vessel. The energy storage 
system is charged at each side of the crossing, using 
a shore-based connection to the local grid. Due to 
the harsh winter conditions in Finland, the ferry 
will be able to use diesel engines to support the 
onboard batteries, which will serve as an extra 
boost travelling through ice. 
Elektra can operate in four different propulsion 
modes, namely: pure battery mode; diesel-electric 
mode; diesel/battery hybrid mode; or all three of 
the aforementioned modes at the same time. This 
hybrid solution was put in place to ensure that the 
ferries will arrive on time regardless of potentially 
tough the ambient conditions.
Elektra has also set a record in being Finland’s 
biggest car ferry. With a length of almost 98m and 
a beam in excess of 15m, the vessel can carry up to 
90 private cars at a time. As such, Elektra carries 
40% more vehicles than the older vessel on the 
route, yet with a corresponding 60% reduction in 
emissions. Elektra will operate the route every 15 
minutes and charge its batteries at both ends, 
during the loading and unloading stages, in 
roughly five minutes. The ferry is equipped with 
two 900kW propeller engines, with two 520kWh 
battery banks and three 420kWe diesel generators.
The hybrid ferry has also been fitted with 
Siemens’ BlueDrive Plus C propulsion concept 
which encompasses a power storage system, a 
warning and observation system and variable-
speed propulsion technology for the propellers. 
Elektra even has a bank of solar panels which 
provide electricity for the crew area during the 
summer season. 
The environmentally friendly ferry improves the 
transport options in the Finnish archipelago on the 
route between Nauvo and Parainen. Elektra is also 
expected to usher in lower operational costs, 
maintenance and repair cost savings and improved 
control and safety through her energy management 
and thruster control systems.

elivered in August 2017, Emmanuel has been 
described as the first purpose-designed harvest 
vessel built to date.  She was designed and constructed 
for, and in conjunction with, the owner, De Bruyn 
Transport, a  Tasmanian company involved with marine 
operations in the local aquaculture industry. Her role is 
dedicated to harvesting salmon for local salmon 
producer Tassal.
Emmanuel will pull up to a fish pen and secure 
alongside using two 3tonne capstans. The harvest team 
will coral the fish with a seine net into a corner of the pen 
for the ship’s fish handling system to suck them aboard. 
The processing system is designed to automatically stun 
and bleed up to 7,000 fish per hour, and deposit them 
into four refrigerated salt water (RSW) tanks at 1⁰C, 
which can store up to 220tonnes of fish. The RSW 
system comprises two 710kW (cooling capacity) chiller 
units, sized to enable rapid pre-cooling of the tank water. 
Blood from the process equipment is recovered into a 
separate blood tank located on the aft deck for later 
processing. On completion of harvest operations, 
Emmanuel transports the refrigerated cargo to the shore 
side factory, where she pumps it ashore. 
After the fish and blood products are discharged 
ashore, the tanks go through an automatic wash down 
and disinfection sequence, while the process equipment 
is cleaned and disinfected by the harvest crew, using 
pressure lances. All the wash down water is collected on 
board in a large waste water tank. Finally the waste water 
is discharged ashore to the factory’s waste water 
treatment facility.
Emmanuel’s hull design is based on Møre Maritime’s 
‘MACHO’ design. This hull form exhibits enhanced 
seakeeping and speed performance. The combination of 
efficient hull design with large nozzle-mounted 
controllable-pitch propeller enables the vessel to achieve 
nearly 12knots fully loaded with only 746kW installed. 
For propulsion redundancy, and taking advantage of the 
large power generation capacity on board, the vessel is 
fitted with a ‘take me home’ propulsion solution based 
on a large electric motor feeding into the aft side of the 
gearbox. This back up propulsion system provides a 
speed of 8-9knots.
Excellent manoeuvrability is required within the fish 
farm leases to enable the vessel to move around and 
between the fish pens. This is achieved with a 
combination of bow and stern thrusters, and a large 
schilling-type (fish tail cross section) rudder.
The vessel provides comfortable living accommodation 
for the seven crew members. The main deck 
accommodation area offers wash down and cloakroom 
areas, plus three single cabins and two double cabins. The 
upper deck accommodation area is dedicated to a large 
mess room, galley, dry store and laundry.

n Wednesday 26 July 2017, Vine Trust’s new 
fully-equipped medical ship, Forth Hope, set 
sail on an epic transatlantic voyage from Babcock 
International in Rosyth, Scotland, to the remote 
Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru. 
As the fourth healthcare vessel commissioned by 
Edinburgh-based international development and 
volunteering charity Vine Trust, Forth Hope is 
destined to provide life-changing primary 
healthcare services to isolated and vulnerable 
communities on the Peruvian Amazon. Complete 
with a dental surgery, operating theatre, 
consultation rooms and a pharmacy, Forth Hope 
will become a floating healthcare centre, enabling 
international medical and dental volunteers, 
alongside a team of local clinicians, to provide 
consultations, treatment and health education free 
of charge.
In the early hours of Thursday 7 September 
with her crew of volunteers, who have each 
donated their time, skills and experience, Forth 
Hope completed her delivery voyage: sailing 
south from Rosyth to Tenerife, before crossing 
the Atlantic Ocean to Macapa, Brazil, and then up 
the mighty Amazon River to the Peruvian city of 
Iquitos.  For a ship originally destined to become 
a shuttle ferry on a five-minute crossing, this 
6,600mile transatlantic voyage will be the first of 
many remarkable achievements throughout its 
working life.
Outfitted with the support of Babcock 
International and 30 private businesses, Forth 
Hope is expected to deliver more than 2 million 
consultations over the next 20 years to 
communities who would otherwise lack access to 
the most basic medical care. Joining Vine Trust’s 
other Peru-based ship, Amazon Hope 2, Vine 
Trust’s Medical Programme in Peru has been 
drawn up to cover more than 160 communities on 
the Amazon and its tributaries.

ydroville is a custom-designed and built 14m 
high-speed displacement catamaran, and the 
first vessel so far passed by a class society to 
operate with passengers using hydrogen fuel in 
her propulsion engines, the burning of which 
produces no CO², particulate matter or sulphur 
oxides.
Built by Portchester, UK-based BW Seacat Ltd 
for owner CMB Technologies of Antwerp, 
Belgium, using a hydrogen system supplied and 
installed by Revolve of Essex, UK, the vessel was 
launched on 5 November 2017 and was blessed at a 
ceremony at the Royal Yacht Club of Belgium 
alongside the banks of the River Schelde in 
Antwerp on 29 November 2017.
Based on a hull form originally designed by BW 
Seacat Ltd managing director Iain Worrallo, 
working closely with naval architect Steven Lee, 
Hydroville is equipped with two Volvo Penta dual-
fuel engines, featuring 441kW in total shaft power 
capacity and driving two contra-rotating 
propellers. The H2ICED (hydrogen internal 
combustion engine-diesel) installation is served by 
12 hydrogen fuel tanks (each rated 200bar) plus 
two diesel tanks supplying ignition and back-up 
fuel, along with associated valves, pipework, safety 
measures and monitoring systems. According to 
BW Seacat, “this has never been attempted before 
in a passenger vessel”. The builder adds: “Two 
hundred hours of complex Dyno testing was 
carried out by Revolve to calibrate and perfect the 
use of hydrogen to displace the diesel in this 
particular model of engine.” 
The vessel is capable of achieving a sprint speed 
of 25knots and 18-20knot service speeds from twin 
engines at her full displacement of 14tonnes.
Comfort for her 16 passengers is provided by 
flip-up seats arranged in opposing banks of two, 
with tables between. The vessel is to be used as a 
test bed for the development of hydrogen as a dual 
fuel in marine propulsion applications, and also as 
a proof of concept for the long-term vision of CMB 
Technologies.
This vision is to substitute the use of diesel for 
hydrogen in the onboard auxiliary engines and 
generators of the large fleet of ships owned and run 
by CMB worldwide, with the associated massive 
reduction in atmospheric pollution that this will 
bring about. The vessel will be bunkered from a 
hydrogen-filling marine station established by 
CMB and Air Liquide at Zwijndrecht, drawing on 
fuel produced locally at a plant in Lillo.

uly 2017 saw Alabama-based boatbuilder Silver 
Ships launch and deliver a new in-house-
designed, multi-mission fireboat for Montauk 
Harbor in East Hampton, New York – a model 
intended to “epitomise interoperability”, East 
Hampton’s Town Police Department commented 
at the time. 
Christened John L. Behan, in memory of the 
Vietnam War veteran and East Hampton 
assemblyman who also served as director of New 
York State’s Division of Veterans Affairs, 
responsibility for the aluminium vessel’s operations 
is currently being shared by the Montauk Fire 
Department, the East Hampton Town Police 
Department, East Hampton Town Marine Patrol 
and the US Department of Homeland Security. 
Such is the vessel’s versatility that Silver Ships 
comments: “It can even serve in place of US Coast 
Guard vessels if the situation arises.” The boat has 
been deployed at Montauk Harbor since its naming 
ceremony, which took place in August. 
For crew comfort and protection whilst in the 
thick of the action, John L. Behan has been 
equipped with a pair of heavy-duty, shock-
absorbing X Mariner II MH seats, provided by 
Seats Inc. Similarly, a walk-around cabin layout is 
intended to make it simple for crew to access the 
bow. An onboard patient transport station, 
meanwhile, can accommodate casualties/patients 
as well as providing room for one such patient to 
lie down. 
The vessel is powered by triple Yamaha 
outboards, rated 224kW apiece, which, Silver 
Ships calculates, permit the vessel to hit and 
exceed 45knots (an alternative arrangement of, 
say, two 186kW engines could be applied to this 
vessel, which would result in top speeds nearer to 
28knots, the builder claims). A Northern Lights 
generator, meanwhile, provides 9kW of power for 
onboard requirements. 
 In full load conditions, with six passengers 
aboard, the vessel is designed to draw 736mm with 
the engines raised and 838mm with the engines 
down, and to displace approximately 9,490kg. The 
fireboat boasts a fuel capacity of 1,150litres.  
A dedicated, 271.4kW, six-litre GMC engine 
drives a Darley PSDE 1500 fire pump, rated 
3,410litres per minute. A single Stang remote fire 
monitor, which sprays only water, is located on the 
roof, allowing fires to be fought at a closer distance 
but with the added protection of controlling water 
flow from inside the cabin.
Other onboard features include a side-sonar 
scan, to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations, 
as well as radio and radar communications.

T
he UK-built twins Jupiter Clipper (delivered in 
June 2017) and Mercury Clipper (following in 
August 2017) caused a splash on London’s River 
Thames last year, both literally and metaphorically, 
as the most technically advanced and energy-
efficient fast ferries in the London fleet, and as the 
first vessels of their kind to be constructed in the 
UK. Both were designed and built to accommodate 
the unique tidal conditions of the River Thames, 
taking into account its shallow reaches and famous 
but often low bridges. 
Designed by Sydney, Australia-based One2three 
Naval Architects, the ferry sisters took 10 months 
to build. These catamarans feature twin 
symmetrical hulls, which were specially designed 
for frequent, repeated berthing at the many 
floating piers on the Thames, with attention paid 
to potential contact with obstructions in the water 
and typical weather conditions. Low-wash 
capability was another important consideration, 
given the amount of small boat traffic encountered 
on some sections of the Thames. 
To stand out from the crowd, and to display a 
professional appearance, each ferry’s external 
spaces have foregone paint in favour of marine 
grade, high-gloss vinyl wrapping. This was not 
purely an aesthetic move: builder Wight Shipyard 
Co. (WSC) confirms that the vinyl covering used 
amounted to approximately 67% the weight of a 
comparative paint application, thus resulting in a 
notable weight saving. 
Passengers are able to enter the main cabin, 
which is air-conditioned, port and starboard and 
forward and aft. Accommodation is provided for 
172 persons, care of Beurteaux Ocean Tourist 
seating, and panoramic and roof windows grant 
all passengers unrestricted views of the London 
skyline. The ferries have also been kitted out with 
LCD screens, displaying safety and tourist 
information, and USB points for recharging 
mobile phones. A kiosk is located between the 
main cabin and forward seating area, and the 
kiosk block provides access to an electronics 
space and the cabin-top wheelhouse. The 
wheelhouse has been equipped with the latest in 
electronic, navigation and communications 
equipment, to comply with the High Speed Craft 
Code, and features two forward-facing, adjustable 
seats, with the captain sitting on the centreline 
and the mate to port. The duo has certainly raised 
eyebrows and come to draw public attention to 
riverine transport within the UK’s capital, with 
both ferries deserving of their ‘iconic’ epithets.

K
lara 1 proved a case of Norway’s Tuco Marine 
modifying its ProZero workboat design – a 
flexible base that can be tailored to result in a variety 
of boat types, including crew transfer vessels –  to 
create a new type of dedicated aquaculture vessel, 
developed to undertake high-pressure cleaning of 
fishing nets in the Norwegian market. 
Klara 1 has been fashioned from composite 
materials, for reduced overall structural weight, 
reduced maintenance requirements and increased 
vessel longevity. When combined with an 
arrangement of twin diesel inboard engines, 
connected to the Volvo Penta IPS propulsion system 
and forward-facing, counter-rotating propellers, this 
low weight grants Klara 1 a top speed in excess of 
34knots, as well as ample fuel efficiency to limit her 
impact on the environment. 
The vessel’s hull structure has been assembled with 
what Tuco describes as “special appendages and 
reinforcements” to suit her activities at the fish farms.  
For instance, the ProZero hull has been designed to 
grant her crew superior stability in rough sea 
conditions, in comparison to many of her 
conventional counterparts. Given the high speeds of 
which she is capable, special attention was also paid 
to ensuring that Klara 1’s crew seats deliver optimal 
shock mitigation, to prevent the risk of short-term 
and long-term injuries due to slamming in high seas.

I
n an exciting transport move for the Big 
Apple, 2017 saw the rollout of a brand new 
ferry network for New York City (NYC), with 
21 neighbourhoods set to be connected via 
water transit across the city by the end of 
2018. 
As one of the first vessels to enter service on 
this passenger ferry network, which is being 
operated by Hornblower Cruises, Lunch Box 
(her moniker having been decided by local 
schoolkids, as part of a vessel naming 
competition) was constructed by Alabama-
based Horizon Shipbuilding. Along with 
Louisiana’s Metal Shark, Horizon has been 
contracted to build the vessels for 
Hornblower’s NYC ferry fleet, to specifications 
provided by Australian naval architect Incat 
Crowther. 
Lunch Box is designed to carry up to 150 
passengers, with 119 seats (in addition to 
wheelchair and baby stroller slots) located in 
the open main deck cabin, and 28 external 
seats located on the upper deck – the latter 
affording “excellent views of the famous 
Hudson River and its landmarks,” Incat 
Crowther explains. The vessel will be operated 
by a two-man crew, and onboard features for 
passengers include free wifi and multiple 
device-charging stations. 
The ferry is powered by two Baudouin 
6M26.3 main engines, each Tier 3-compliant 
and rated 599kW at 2,100rpm. These drive a 
pair of five-bladed propellers and enable a 
cruise speed of 25knots, ascending to more 
than 27knots max. With an eye on 
environmental protection, to keep the 
waterways clean, Lunch Box and her sisters 
have replaced typical solvent-based paints 
with vinyl coatings. 
Lunch Box has also been designed to offer 
quick turn-around times, using the standard 
NYC bow loading geometry. Incat Crowther 
explains: “This allows the vessels to nose into 
wharves with minimal mooring. The 
wheelhouse of the vessel is situated 
immediately behind the foredeck with 
excellent views over the boarding area, 
enhancing operational safety.”

O
ne of the most recent in a series of 
collaborations between Scotland’s Macduff 
Ship Design and Turkish builder Tor Marine 
resulted in two new pilot vessels making their 
way to the Arabian Gulf in Q2 2017. 
The vessels, Marcap Tam 1 and Marcap Tam 
2, are owned and operated by Saudi MarCap, 
which oversees a fleet of tugs / AHTS vessels, 
multipurpose vessels, crew boats and barges. 
Each of the newbuilds features a length overall 
of 26.7m – itself quite unusually long compared 
to more traditional pilot boats – as well as a 
breadth of 7m and a depth of 3.34m. Each boat 
has been designed to accommodate up to eight 
crew and four pilots, with onboard cabin space 
providing berths for up to 10 persons. 
To ensure the boats were fully equipped to 
thrive in their operational environment, 
Macduff Ship Design undertook an extensive 
round of model testing at the University of 
Southampton’s Wolfson Unit for Marine 
Technology and Industrial Aerodynamics. As 
part of this process, a 1:15 scale model was 
built out of wood and GRP and both resistance 
and sea-keeping tests were carried out in order 
to ensure the smoothest performance and 
optimum handling in a variety of sea conditions 
in the Arabian Gulf. The vessels’ spray rails 
were also modified for optimum seakeeping. 
Each pilot boat is equipped with a pair of 
Yanmar 12 AYM-WGT engines, each rated 
1,340kW at 1,940rpm. The boats have exceeded 
Saudi MarCap’s specification for a top speed of 
14.5knots at 80% MCR; in sea trials, conducted 
shortly before handover, Marcap Tam 1 and 
Marcap Tam 2 achieved speeds of 16.2knots 
and 16knots respectively at 80% MCR, while 
flat-out operation at 100% MCR saw both 
vessels reach 18.1knots.

D
esigned by Walker Marine Designs for 
Mainprize Offshore, MO4 was built 
specifically for an eight-year contract at 
Deutsche 
Windtechnik’s 
Nordergründe 
windfarm. 
Although the farm is fairly modest (comprising 
18 turbines located 15 miles offshore), it does 
come with a few challenges: for instance, it is 
located in shallow water which is changeable 
because of a moving sandbar. Therefore, it was 
calculated that any vessel servicing the farm 
would be required to carry a team of 12 turbine 
technicians, four standard 20ft containers plus 
30tonnes of deck cargo. To cater for all of this, 
MO4’s 9.7m beam is fairly wide for her 23m 
length, to give the vessel a useful 77m² aft and 
63m² on the forward deck.
MO4 has also been built with a 1.4m draught, as 
opposed to 1.6m, to extend her operational window.
Buoyancy was a major concern during the 
design process, to make sure the vessel could take 
the required load. The length was increased by 
2.6m to gain more volume in the hulls for around 
the same overall displacement. 
Power comes from a pair of Caterpillar C32s, 
supplied by Finning, which yield a total 2,386kW, 
with ZF gearboxes. To avoid the risk of the vessel 
coming out of the water, fixed propellers were 
deployed: these propellers are tucked up inside 
the hull, inside a half-tunnel. Although this 
means a little speed was sacrificed, the tunnels 
have heightened the bollard push, which is 
arguably crucial for a windfarm service vessel. 
Sea trials have proven MO4 capable of delivering 
approximately 16tonnes of force.
MO4 also has an impressive fluid cargo capacity 
of 20,500litres of fuel oil (and the same again for 
fresh water) allowing the vessel to refuel all of the 
mobile power units on the windfarm to 80% 
capacity in one day.
It was imperative to keep the weight of the vessel 
down during construction so as not to undermine 
all the hard work put into the design. So, 
boatbuilder AMC subjected the process to a 
‘Weightwatchers’ plan with continual monitoring. 
As a result of this, the boat is light for her size, 
coming in at just under 60tonnes in all.
Rob Stewart, commercial director at AMC, said 
the project constituted a landmark build for the 
firm. “MO4 is a ground-breaking design offering 
extensive fore and aft deck space and huge saloon 
capacity, to enable a quick change to 24 technician 
passengers if required,” he commented at the time 
of the vessel’s delivery.

elivered in May 2017, the five-deck cruise 
and event ship MS Diamant has become an 
exclusive attraction and landmark on Lake 
Lucerne, Switzerland, featuring innovative 
interior design and many significant features 
such as the Nautilus room in the lower deck, 
which provides sightseeing into the Lake World, 
thanks to underwater windows, and which has 
been designed along the theme of 20,000 Leagues 
Under The Sea by author Jules Verne. 
A further design element is the aft water terrace 
with a flowing footbath, enabling guests to enjoy 
the ride very close to the water surface. “No 
matter what course the ship is holding, the 
movable compass lounge on the sun deck is 
always aligned with the cardinal points,” builder 
and designer Shiptec claims. 
MS Diamant is intended to serve as a means of 
hosting events and charter cruises of all types. In 
order to provide the necessary flexibility, a part of 
the upper deck salon can be lowered by a 
hydraulic lift to the main deck. This allows the 
charterers to either enjoy two completely separate 
salons or a large salon over two decks with an 
attractive gallery. A large glass dome above the 
two salons brings sunlight into the main deck via 
the open gallery and contributes to the ambience 
with crystalline support structure.
Having assessed and measured multiple 
operational profiles of ships in comparable 
operational modes and environments, Shiptec 
determined that a new hybrid propulsion system 
– one developed in cooperation with Siemens 
Marine Systems – would prove the optimal 
solution to reduce fuel consumption. This parallel 
hybrid system, which incorporates propulsion as 
well as the general energy management of all 
energy-consuming parts on board, comprises 
different components that are controlled by a 
dynamic management system in such a way that 
“the distinct, transient processes can be smoothed 
out as much as possible”, Shiptec adds. “This 
allows the multiple diesel engines [with particle 
filters], which are the main energy producers, to 
work at their most efficient operating point [or 
they may at times be shut off entirely due to 
battery buffers].”
And the first six months of the vessel’s 
operations would suggest that this bid for 
efficiency has paid off, with the operator 
reporting a 25% reduction in fuel consumption 
during this period, compared with other state-of-
the art-vessels in the same category. This has been 
credited to MS Diamant’s hybrid energy and 
propulsion system, in combination with her 
lightweight design and optimised hull shape. 
Moreover, Shiptec adds, by downsizing relevant 
components, maintenance costs have been 
reduced by as much as 40%.

T
he development of Murjan 40, operated by 
Saudi 
Arabia-based 
Murjan 
Al-Sharq, 
represents an effort by Damen to evolve its Damen 
Multi Cat platform, adding shallow water dredging 
capabilities to the mix – reportedly a first for the 
Dutch-headquartered boatbuilding giant. 
Developed to undertake precision dredging 
projects, this Multi Cat 1908 type has been 
equipped with a DOP Submersible Dredge Pump 
250. Damen explains: “To further fulfil its role as a 
dredger, Murjan 40 has been installed with a spud 
system that can be deployed in water depths of up 
to 10m.” As such, the operator is spared the effort 
and expense of deploying a complex mooring 
system when working on-station. The DOP pump 
can be lowered via the vessel’s A-frame, which has 
a SWL capacity of 20tonnes, or via onboard crane. 
A certain amount of versatility has been built 
into the vessel, however, as would appear to be the 
key trend among many modern workboats. Damen 
adds: “When not dredging, the operator can use 
Murjan 40 for a range of other tasks, including 
transportation, dive support, towage, anchor-
handling and pollution control.”

A
lbatross Marine Design’s (AMD’s) PA72 class 
comprises a composite boat, built in tandem 
with Russia’s ‘diversification’ policy. This policy was 
introduced by the Russian government in 2014 to 
avoid dependence on imported materials and 
products – and, AMD managing director Albert 
Nazarov explains, especially materials from countries 
“involved in ‘sanctions wars’”. He continues: “This 
allows independent production of strategic products 
despite any shortage of spares and materials. The 
builders are trying to rely on domestic materials 
when we design boats for the Russian market.” For 
instance, glass, resins, foams and carbon fibre can be 
‘repurposed’ from, say, the military aircraft sector, 
whereas, before 2014, they were largely imported. 
The use of composites has also resulted in a lighter 
hull than would have been the case with steel or 
aluminium. Nazarov notes: “The cost and availability 
of composite materials are getting more and more 
attractive every year. For the structure, a carbon 
sandwich with epoxy resins and domestically made 
PVC core is applied.” 
A lighter hull also means less foam is required to 
provide buoyancy in the case of swamping, he says, 
adding: “The boat is very stable at turns due to 
reduced mass of superstructure.” 
The PA72 class – the first of which was delivered in 
August 2017, to an unspecified customer – offers 
customers the option of outboards, waterjets and/or 
stern drives. The boat can accommodate a load of 
1tonne – including people, stores and cargo – in 
accordance with ISO8666: for instance, a 40’ hi-cube 
container can be installed on the side, to 
accommodate two boats. However, Nazarov points 
out: “We did not intend to make [the PA72] a load 
carrier, but rather a fast and safe platform for family 
recreation or government services.”

T
he 15m RT Borkum was designed exclusively 
for demonstration purposes and training 
exercises, incorporating the Rotortug concept so 
as to provide trainees a realistic experience of 
these vessel types – for both potential crew 
members/tug personnel and customers wishing 
to experience how the Rotortug performs and 
handles within their own territories, and to their 
particular operational requirements. 
As with the Rotortug series, RT Borkum features 
a triple-Z drive configuration, with two azimuthing 
thrusters positioned forward and one positioned 
aft. The triangular arrangement also enables a 
stable equilibrium between the towing cable and 
the propulsive force of the thrusters, so the tug can 
sail ahead while towing, rather than having to sail 
astern. Having three separate propulsion systems 
at its disposal also grants the crew an added degree 
of redundancy. 
RT Borkum’s three Scania D19 070M main diesel 
engines are connected to three Veth Z-drive 
thrusters via carbon composite shafts, primarily 
selected to decrease overall vessel weight. Trials 
have revealed that this arrangement is capable of 
resulting in a bollard pull of 10knots and a free 
running speed of 8knots. 
An interesting design consideration is that RT 
Borkum was outfitted to a high-end yacht quality 
finish, which includes: polished stainless steel 
bollards; bonded windows; teak decks; teak 
caprails; and a high-gloss topcoat. The interior, 
meanwhile, has been crafted with woodwork 
and leather consoles, and places a particular 
emphasis on natural lighting. Heated and air-
conditioned living quarters offer satellite TV 
and galley/sanitary facilities in accordance with 
ILO regulations. 
Meanwhile, Alphatron Marine supplied its 
AlphaBridge tugboat solution to RT Borkum's 
wheelhouse. The AlphaBridge is made up of two 
consoles, accessible by a rail-mounted, centrally 
positioned chair for the captain. With ergonomics 
and comfort in mind, the chair can be turned 
180degs, enabling the captain to face either 
direction, while the display arrangement, 
Alphatron says, ensures that the screen functions 
always remain in the same position.

hile the offshore wind farm support 
market has undergone a slight lull in 
recent years, this period has provided a 
relative breathing space for architects and 
designers to develop advanced, more cost-
effective and faster means of transporting 
turbine technicians and equipment between 
shore and wind farm. 
Incat Crowther’s contribution to this new 
breed of vessels was the CrewZer catamaran 
concept. The first twins in this class, SEACOR 
Puma and SEACOR Panther, were built at 
Spanish yard Astilleros Armon for 
longstanding Incat Crowther customer 
SEACOR Marine, though, Incat explained, 
boast 30% more deadweight capacity than 
their predecessor vessels, whilst still 
retaining the capability to travel at speeds in 
excess of 40knots. 
Like its predecessors, each aluminium 
CrewZer is certified to carry up to 142 
turbine 
te chnici ans, 
but 
inste ad 
accommodates 76 technicians in reclining 
seats. Each ‘passenger’ seat comes with 
privacy partitions, reading lights and device 
charging ports – features, Incat Crowther 
said, that were in part inspired by the 
arrangements used for long-haul ‘business 
class’ flights. As well as guaranteeing the 
technicians some degree of privacy and 
comfort, SEACOR Puma and her sisters also 
feature hospital facilities, passenger 
bathrooms and self-service café bars for their 
convenience.
Each CrewZer also features overnight crew 
cabin facilities, situated below deck, to 
permit extended operations far from shore. 
The port hull features a galley, crew mess, 
two twin cabins and a bathroom, while the 
starboard cabin has five twin cabins and a 
bathroom. Upstairs, the wheelhouse has been 
designed to offer maximum visibility over 
both ends of the vessel. Power is supplied by 
a quartet of Cummins QSK 95 main engines, 
driving four HamiltonJet HT-810 waterjets 
through Twin Disc gearboxes. On-station 
manoeuvring for this DP2-classed vessel, 
meanwhile, is enhanced via a pair of 
retractable bow thrusters.

D
eveloped as a multipurpose support vessel, 
Sleypnir, the first in Rafnar’s Flengur 850 
class, has been designed with transportability in 
mind, making it relatively simple to deploy the 
vessel as a tactical craft in a number of different 
and remote locations – not least because of her 
low draught of 0.57m.
However, this class is not exclusively suited to 
military or police work: Rafnar also envisions 
leisure versions of the Flengur 850 that could serve 
as RIBS and superyacht tenders. 
The Flengur 850 incorporates Rafnar’s ÖK Hull 
design, which was introduced in 2015. Compared 
to similarly sized planing or semi-planing hulls, 
the ÖK Hull was developed to provide unusually 
high levels of stability and comfort at high speeds 
(especially when travelling at 40knots or more) – 
considerations that are becoming increasingly 
scrutinised as naval, police and military customers 
look to combat fatigue and the likelihood of whole 
body vibration-related injuries. 
Also, while being displacement-type hulls and 
remaining, for the most part, in the water, the ÖK 
concept enables the vessel to power forward 
without creating a displaced-water ‘bow-wave’, and 
simultaneously avoiding the formation of a ‘hole’ 
in the transom area behind the boat.  Therefore, 
when powering forward at speed, or decreasing 
speed rapidly, the boat constantly retains an ‘even-
keel’ aspect, not fighting to overcome the water 
ahead and attempting to ‘climb over the hump’, and 
likewise not falling back into the ‘hole’ when 
decelerating suddenly.

S
ituated off County Antrim in Northern Ireland 
(NI), Rathlin Island is a popular draw for 
tourists. Up until 2017, the island maintained links 
with Ballycastle, County Antrim via two passenger 
ferries: the 22.5m, 1975-built Canna and the 18m 
aluminium passenger cat Rathlin Express, built by 
Arklow Marine Services of the Republic of Ireland, 
in 2009. Given her age, NI’s department for 
Infrastructure (DFI) decided last year to retire 
Canna and to commission a new companion for 
Rathlin Express. Arklow Marine won the tender for 
this replacement vessel, which has subsequently 
entered service as Spirit of Rathlin.
Other than their variances in size, the main 
difference between Rathlin Express and Spirit of 
Rathlin is that the former was a passenger-only 
ferry, capable of ferrying 96 passengers between 
Ballycastle and Rathlin Island within approximately 
20 minutes, whereas Spirit of Rathlin can carry 140 
passengers in addition to six cars or an articulated 
truck, and typically within 30 minutes at 9.5knots.
The new ferry was designed by Argyll Maritime 
Services of Scotland, in cooperation with the UK 
Maritime & Coastguard Agency (MCA), Lloyd’s 
Register and naval architect Burness Corlett Three 
Quays. Fashioned in steel, Spirit of Rathlin was 
designed as a bow-loading ferry, with a 120m² 
vehicle deck situated forward. The enclosed 
passenger lounge, which accommodates 42 
persons, is located aft, while a further 100 seats are 
fitted into the open-air spaces for passengers on 
Deck 2 (80 passengers) and Deck 3 (18 passengers).
 Spirit of Rathlin features a double-chine hull and 
a flat bottom, and is fitted with heavy grounding 
bars forward, to facilitate grounding on the slip 
when loading and discharging. Interestingly, the 
vessel was designed to meet the regulations for 
both an EU Class C passenger/vehicle ferry 
engaged on domestic voyages and a UK workboat 
under 24m (MGN 280). Alisdair Salmon, director 
at Argyll Maritime Design, explained: “While 
certification under the workboat code was not 
absolutely necessary, the dual passenger/workboat 
code certification involved very little additional 
work or cost, and a few potential advantages. For 
instance, when operating with 12 or less 
passengers, she can operate as a workboat code 
vessel. In these circumstances, she is not 
constrained by EU class C survivability standards, 
allowing increased deck cargo-carrying capacity. 
“Also, voyages to the shipyard – for maintenance, 
survey work, and so on – can be carried out under 
code certification, eliminating the need for issue of 
voyage-specific single voyage load line exemption 
certificates. It is also easier to administer the 
document of compliance for the carriage of certain 
dangerous goods.”
 Another consideration was to ensure that Spirit 
of Rathlin's engine room was made relatively 
spacious, for the crew’s convenience and safety. 
Special attention has also been paid to onboard 
wastewater treatment: the ferry deploys an Ecomax 
8AC sewage treatment vacuum system, while a 
monitoring system watches over the contents of 
four tanks, the bilges in nine areas and the draughts 
at four locations.

amen developed the SAR 1906 in conjunction 
with the Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue 
Institution (KNRM), the Delft University of 
Technology and De Vries Lentsch Naval Architects. 
Naturally a key feature in the design is safety. For 
this reason, the SAR was developed with Damen’s 
Axe Bow technology, for optimal seakeeping.
To ensure this safety, where possible, mechanical 
solutions have been applied instead of electrical 
ones to offer optimal durability. Examples include 
extra water traps to the ventilation inlets and 
exhaust systems. 
As part of an agreement between the European 
Union and International Organization for 
Migration (IOM), Damen has a contract with the 
Turkish Coast Guard for the delivery of six SAR 
1906 vessels. Damen has continued to work with 
the client on developing the vessels’ safety 
performance.
This has led, recently, to a successful roll over test 
with engines running. Damen worked closely with 
the engine manufacturer, MTU, to develop the 
required software. In the event that the vessel 
capsizes in severe weather, the capsize switch 
detects it and signals to the software to go into roll 
over mode. At this moment, the water jets are 
automatically clutched out and the engine returns 
to idle mode to protect the engine. This continues 
until the software detects that the vessel has righted 
itself, at which point the crew is able to regain 
direct control.

apable of slicing through sea state 4 waves at 
high speed without sacrificing stability, 
Thunder Child, the prototype of Safehaven’s new 
XSV 17 class, was designed and built to undertake 
grueling naval and police work, from hunting 
down traffickers and protecting offshore sites 
and harbours to directly engaging in military 
encounters. 
The patrol boat was developed off the back of 
Safehaven’s Barracuda class, originally launched in 
2015 as a model scalable between 11-13m in length 
with a flat-planing hull form. The XSV 17’s hull 
form combines a deep-vee deadrise at the transom 
and a wave-piercing bow form. Safehaven explains: 
“A very fine wave-cutting waterline entry at the 
bow effectively minimises vertical accelerations at 
speed in waves, thereby maximising crew 
endurance in rough offshore conditions.” The hull 
also features a twin-chine arrangement, for 
enhanced dynamic and static stability. 
These design considerations enable the XSV 17 
to function in three distinct operational modes: 
namely, conventional high-speed planing; semi-
planing; and full wave-piercing. In this way, the 
crew can make adjustments depending on the 
nature of their current missions and the 
environmental conditions they are facing. When 
the bow is depressed, the vessel can cut through 
head seas at high speed; similarly, the bow can be 
raised when encountering significantly large waves 
and reducing speed. 
Safehaven estimates that the XSV 17 is survivable 
in conditions up to sea state 8, capable of effective 
operation up to sea state 6 and capable of 
maintaining high speed up to sea state 4. 
To match high strength with reduced weight, 
Thunder Child’s hull and superstructure have been 
fashioned from cored composites. Seaglaze 
supplied the craft’s wheelhouse windows, which 
have been strengthened to withstand wave impacts: 
she features 20mm laminated glass for her front 
windows and 12mm hard-coated polycarbonate 
windows elsewhere. Customers can also 
incorporate ballistic protection, up to BR6 level of 
protection, into the windows. 
Several layout options are available. Thunder 
Child, for instance, can accommodate 10 personnel 
in her main cabin, with an additional six persons 
located in the lower forward cabin. Onboard living 
facilities are designed to support long-range 
operations. The six seats in the prototype’s lower 
forward cabin are of AMP Power’s ‘Wavebreaker’ 
shock-mitigating design.
Although the XSV 17 range allows for either 
surface drives or waterjets, the prototype model 
has been fitted with Metamarine 7IT12 compact 
surface drives with 838mm-diameter propellers. 
The drives comprise an articulated system, thereby 
enabling the craft’s crew to raise and lower the 
propellers as required. These act as variable-pitch 
props and can be adjusted to suit vessel load. 
Although the XSV 17 carries a wide range of 
weapons, both lethal and non-lethal, it is able to 
stash away its arsenal, concealing it from view, 
whilst in pursuit mode. Safehaven explains: “The 
weapons are concealed below decks in the forward 
section of the superstructure or main cabin roof, 
and are raised up to above deck level for 
deployment through large watertight carbon fibre 
hatches built into the roof section.” This method of 
concealment has several advantages: as well as 
potentially lulling enemies into a false sense of 
security, this approach reduces the XSV 17’s radar 
cross-section (RCS) signature, making it harder to 
pick the vessel up on radar. The weapons can also 
be stowed to reduce the vessel’s vertical centre of 
gravity when necessary – for instance, when 
encountering harsh weather. 
Should the client require an even lower RCS, the 
XSV 17 can be tailored accordingly. Safehaven 
states: “The design utilises various stealth 
technologies to produce a lower RCS…allowing it 
to operate with a very high degree of invisibility to 
an adversary’s radar.” These stealth technologies 
have been factored into the boat’s superstructure 
and hull design, “utilising flat plane principles to 
its surfaces in its front, aft and cabin side 
projections to deflect radar beams away from 
source.” 
The company adds: “These unique features work 
together with radiation-absorbent material and 
specialised outfitting – including minimal metallic 
fittings above deck – to produce a vessel with a 
significantly lower-than-normal RCS – primarily 
from forward and rear aspects but also to a high 
level in side aspects.” All of which gives the boat a 
distinct advantage when encountering more 
conventionally styled patrol craft, and the ability to 
‘duck’ under the radar before launching a full-
throttle uppercut against the designated target. 
In July, Thunder Child set a new world record for 
circumnavigating Ireland – a journey involving a 
total distance of more than 2,000km –  in a record 
time of just over 34 hours.

SV Maxlimer  is primarily the brainchild of UK 
company 
Sea-Kit 
International, 
which 
developed this first-in-class member of the Sea-Kit 
vessel range to serve as an autonomous underwater 
vehicle (AUV) mothership.  
The vessel concept was originally developed as an 
entrant into Shell’s Ocean Discovery XPRIZE 
challenge, a US$7 million call-out for ocean 
exploration solutions. “Keeping humans out of harm’s 
way is very much one of the guiding principles of the 
concept,” Ifor Bielecki, executive director at Sea-Kit, 
told Ship & Boat International. “In the commercial 
offshore industry, where safety is king, the only way 
to truly mitigate risk of injury is by removing humans 
from the vessel completely.” 
Rather than following the template of a standard 
AUV launch/recovery craft, USV Maxlimer has been 
built to a ship-style design. Bielecki explained: 
“Smaller and lighter vessels will be limited by weather, 
with sea state 5 being a common restriction. On our 
second sea trial, we took the Sea-Kit out in far worse 
conditions and the only people that were 
uncomfortable were the crew of the support vessel!”
USV Maxlimer was constructed in aluminium by 
Essex-based boatbuilder Hush Craft Ltd, which also 
produced and supplied the vessel’s diesel-electric hybrid 
system. This comprises two DC generators powering a 
pair of 18kW engines, turning twin fixed-pitch, 
400mm-diameter, electric azipod propellers. Additionally, 
the vessel has been fitted with two bow thrusters, rated 
5kW apiece. This arrangement enables a range of 
12,000nm and an endurance of 270 days, depending on 
speed, with top speed calculated to be 8knots. 
The Sea-Kit has the capacity for a payload of 2.5tonnes: 
as such, it can be deployed for other research and survey-
related tasks, such as multibeam survey missions.  Bielecki 
said: “The overall payload area can be changed depending 
on the mission the vessel is built for. For the multi-beam 
mapping variant, we can make additions to the hull to 
ensure even better speed, range and endurance.”  This is 
possible thanks to the inclusion of calibrated mounting 
points, enabling operators to fit a variety of underwater 
equipment, such as acoustic positioning systems, water 
sampling environmental monitoring sensors, acoustic 
monitoring or multi-beam echo-sounding equipment. 
The entire vessel can be fitted inside a single standard ISO 
40ft (12.2m) shipping container. 
For a viable means of guaranteeing remote-control and 
autonomous operations, USV Maxlimer has been fitted 
with Kongsberg Maritime’s K-Mate Autonomy Controller 
solution, which effectively functions as the ship’s ‘brain’ 
during autonomous operations. Bielecki elucidated: “A 
mission plan is uploaded into the K-Mate system and the 
Sea-Kit will follow this. Should any conflicts or issues be 
detected, the operator is alerted and control can be taken 
of the vessel remotely, if required, or the mission plan can 
be updated. 
The Sea-Kit concept could one day be employed as an 
autonomous firefighting or first responder vessel. 
Equipped with fire monitors and pumps, the ship could 
be programmed to advance directly into burning port or 
coastal areas, or towards burning vessels, for example, to 
tackle blazes head-on. Similarly, it could be sent into areas 
affected by real or suspected chemical, biological, 
radiological and nuclear (CBRN) attacks, to extinguish 
chemical blazes and collect CBRN environmental 
samples without exposing human personnel to risk.
Unmanned vessels could also save a lot of money, both 
in initial capex and subsequent opex.  “We have estimates 
for various missions of total costs being potentially less 
than 25% of traditional costs, and potentially even less,” 
Bielecki revealed. “Sea-Kit allows for savings in: initial 
build cost; daily running costs, including fuel, insurance 
and maintenance; transit costs, through its ability to be 
transported, globally, by container; and crew costs.”
