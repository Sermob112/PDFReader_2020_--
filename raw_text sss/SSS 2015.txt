aking its debut at the Seawork International 
Exhibition in June 2015, Alusafe’s 1100 fast 
interceptor craft (FIC) prototype certainly captured 
visitor attention – due, in part, to its striking livery, 
and the high speeds offered by this new class of 
patrol boat. 
Designed and constructed by Norway’s Maritime 
Partner, and intended to be pushed to the limit by 
coast guard / police agencies and naval fleet 
operators alike, the Alusafe 1100 FIC features a 
planing monohull with a single chine and deep-vee 
hullform, intended to assist the crew in cutting 
through inclement weather at a service speed of 
50knots, increasing to at least 60knots max. The hull 
has been fashioned from marine grade aluminium 
and is reinforced by longitudinal stiffeners, as well 
as transverse frames and bulkheads. 
 At this stage of development, pre-order, the 
vessel relies on a pair of Mercury Verado 400 
outboards; however, Maritime Partner states, the 
craft can also be configured to operate with 
three outboards, should higher speeds and extra 
kick be required. 
One of the Alusafe 1100 FIC’s key design 
features has been the ‘puncture-proof’ nature of 
its modular fender system, which comprises 
fender modules, mounting hardware and fixing 
profiles. The boat can be fitted with ballistic 
protection to various levels, and a host of 
different rapid entry/boarding systems can be 
integrated into the class. Maritime Partner has 
also ensured that the vessel will not be ducking 
out of action prematurely; the inclusion of two 
petrol tanks, each with a capacity of 550litres, 
has enabled the vessel to attain a range  
of 225nm. 
The Alusafe 1100 FIC is just one in a range of 
new FIC proposed by Maritime Partner; other 
models include the Alusafe 1200 FIC, which 
adds the presence of a cabin, and the Alusafe 
1400 FIC, designed for operations in sea state 4 
and capable of accommodating four crew 
members and up to 12 passengers/casualties.

A
s the first of two new crew and supply transfer 
vessels delivered to offshore operator Seacor 
Marine, for deployment in Saudi Arabia, the 
62.8m loa Alya McCall captured the marine 
sector’s attention in Q4 2015, raising the bar for 
these vessel types by dint of her size. 
Far larger than standard CTVs or supply craft, 
Alya McCall represents the debutant in the Incat 
Crowther-designed and Gulf Craft-built Express 
Plus class. The vessel was planned and pieced 
together in Louisiana, US, home to both Gulf 
Craft’s shipbuilding facilities and Incat Crowther’s 
US office. 
Alya McCall, measures 62.79m loa (58.9m wl), 
10.06m in breadth and 4.6m in depth, and has 
been designed to carry up to 16 crew members and 
100 passengers. Fashioned from marine grade 
aluminium, the US-flagged vessel draws 2.8m. 
Onboard capacities include 316,000litres of fuel oil 
and 28,000litres of fresh water, and the main deck 
covers an area of 328m², strengthened to house 
approximately 300tonnes’ worth of cargo. 
The vessel is powered by five Cummins 
QSK60-M main engines, rated 1,998kW apiece, 
driving five Hamilton HT-810 waterjets through 
Twin Disc MGX 61500 SC reverse reduction 
gearboxes. The gearboxes are connected to the 
jets via a cardan shafting system provided by 
Driveline Service. Of the HT-810 units, the jet 
positioned on the boat’s centre line will not 
feature steering or reverse buckets, as its primary 
function is to beef up the vessel’s speed. 
In sea trials, the above configuration was shown 
to grant Alya McCall a top speed of 38knots in 
lightship mode. When fully loaded, the vessel’s 
speed would be more in the region of 20knots, 
although, by Seacor Marine’s admission, those 
seeking high / lightship speeds are the target 
market for the Express Plus range. 
The vessel has also been fitted with three 
Cummins QSM 11 generators (each rated 
290kWe) for onboard power, and a trio of 149kW 
bow thrusters, produced by Thrustmaster, for 
enhanced station-keeping capability. The 
thrusters and jets are controlled by a dynamic 
positioning 2 (DP2) system, supplied by 
Kongsberg. Seacor Marine claims that this 
thruster arrangement provides an added layer of 
redundancy; should one bow thruster fail, the 
vessel will be able to maintain its DP2 status. For 
crew and passenger comfort, Gulf Craft has also 
installed a Naiad Dynamics ride control system 
aboard the vessel, while FFS provided her fire 
pump system.

A
lysée represents the first (and possibly a 
one-off) in Alnmaritec’s new 15.2m 
aluminium Wave Farmer 1400 mussel farming 
boat class, which the UK yard designed and 
assembled for operator Offshore Shellfish. This 
series has been described as a development of 
the builder’s established Wave Train catamaran 
hull design, which includes fine forward 
sections developing into a medium deadrise, 
single chine hull form. However, given Offshore 
Shellfish’s specific operational requirements off 
the UK’s south-western coast, Alysée has been 
customised precisely to meet the tasks at hand. 
For example, one major requirement with this 
new vessel was that she would be able to access 
Offshore Shellfish’s rope-grown mussel farms, 
situated in Lyme Bay, Devon, in a fuel-efficient 
and timely manner. This also required superior 
manoeuvrability and a stable working platform 
for crew. To meet this latter specification, Alysée 
was fitted with three hydraulically operated 
davits along her port side, each supported by a 
1tonne-capacity winch and star wheel haulers on 
fold-out arms. Another notable design feature 
was the creation of removable railings on the 
side, enabling a clear working area over the 
vessel’s side when required. The deck is 
complemented by a knuckle boom crane with a 
SWL of 1tonne. The davits, crane and special 
mussel farming equipment are powered by a 
single auxiliary Doosan PU066 engine, via twin 
hydraulic pumps. 
Meanwhile, spacious storage lockers have been 
situated on both sides of the central anchor 
locker at Alysée’s forward end, with additional 
lockers provided to the front and side of the 
wheelhouse. 
Waterjets proved the most reliable propulsive 
option, given that the vessel would be exposed to 
sections of water containing significant debris. 
To this end, the craft’s two Cummins main 
engines feature a pair of sea water intakes apiece, 
for consistent performance. The Hamilton 
waterjets were supplied with that manufacturer’s 
blue ARROW control system, for ease of use 
when completing tricky manoeuvring and 
berthing procedures, at low speed, within 
confined spaces and the restricted conditions of 
the typical offshore mussel farm. 
At time of going to press, it was uncertain 
whether a second Wave Farmer 1400 vessel was 
in the pipeline; however, Alnmaritec has 
announced its intention to develop a “much 
larger platform” with the capacity to land as 
much as 50tonnes of mussels in a single trip.

ugust Nærø is the first in Swedish builder 
Dockstavarvet’s new Interceptor 20 M (IC 20 
M) class. The IC 20 M is based on the group’s 
previous IC 16 M and IC 19 M patrol /police / 
combat boat design ranges, but, as its name 
suggests, has been enlarged to meet greater 
operational demands, related to loads, speeds and 
seakeeping.
As the debut in this class, August Nærø has been 
classed by DNV GL for Service Area R1 operations, 
and is configured to act as a search and rescue 
(SAR) and service vessel. The vessel has been built 
in all-welded aluminium and was fitted with a 
resiliently mounted wheelhouse structure. As a 
result, Dockstavarvet estimates, noise within the 
wheelhouse has been limited to 61db(A) when the 
vessel is cruising at 40knots. Similar low noise 
levels, of 71db(A), have been recorded in the 
vessel’s transport room at this speed; both levels 
being surprisingly low for a high-speed craft of this 
size.
August Nærø features a fully equipped weight of 
34tonnes and a loading capacity of 8-10tonnes. 
Her aft deck is designed to take 3tonnes and is 
fitted with a Palfinger crane. The vessel’s 
wheelhouse roof is reinforced to accommodate 
remote weapon stations, while a MANUPLUS 
fender system (comprising polyurethane and 
polyethylene) is fitted along the sheer strake, 
complemented by a rubber fender around the bow. 
The vessel’s propulsion package comprises a pair 
of 20litre main engines driving waterjets through 
reverse/reduction gearboxes, and Humphree 
interceptor tabs have been fitted for enhanced ride 
control. The IC 20 M is intended for use across a 
range of extreme weather conditions, and, as such, 
has been equipped with a 40kW heating system, 
provided by manufacturer Kabola, and a Cruisair-/
Dometic-supplied chilled water system, for air 
conditioning. As an alternative source of heat, the 
vessel can draw on the fresh water circuits of the 
main engines, via heat exchangers.
All onboard windows are electrically heated and 
feature defrosting capability. The production 
version of the IC 20 M class can be offered as a 
landing craft, with a combat craft-style bow ramp, 
or as a patrol craft, the latter of which enables the 
owner to choose from a variety of interior 
arrangements, including quarters for up to eight 
members of personnel.

outh African shipyard Veecraft Marine 
extended its reach into the offshore marine 
sector in 2015 with the completion and delivery 
of a new wave-piercing crew transfer vessel 
(CTV) for Nigeria’s African Diving Services. 
The Cape Town yard, which has previously 
specialised in the production of small 
commercial and naval vessels, rolled out the 
30.3m loa Benreoch in late June, which has been 
designed – by Australia’s Incat Crowther – to 
enable personnel transfers to offshore platforms 
located in Nigeria’s offshore waters. 
The contract has also seen Incat Crowther 
consolidate its influence in the African sector. 
The group notably drew up the plans for the 
27.6m x 7.5m, 32knot, 2011-delivered Topaz 
Zenith, the first in its Topaz Z class of wave-
piercing crew transfer catamarans, which was 
built at Nicocraft for Qatar-headquartered 
operator Topaz Marine. Incat Crowther has 
expanded on these dimensions to produce the 
arrangement for Benreoch, which, in addition to 
featuring an increased length, also extends the 
beam to 8.5m, complemented by a depth of 3.2m 
and a hull draught of 1.35m. Both the hull and the 
technician/passenger cabin are fashioned from 
marine grade aluminium. 
The main beneficiary of these expanded 
dimensions is the CTV’s aft working deck, which 
provides space for a rescue boat, a crane and 
53m² worth of cargo space, providing ample 
room for 10ft and 20ft containers, should the 
crew need to take supplies, equipment and gear 
to their offshore destinations. Benreoch’s tanks 
enable the vessel to store up to 30,000litres of 
fuel oil, 4,000litres of fresh water and 500litres 
of sullage. 
Special attention was paid to the design of the 
cat’s bows, Incat Crowther reveals. The main 
consideration was to ensure that the vessel can 
“interface cleanly” with the offshore platform, 
providing a smooth connection for the onboard 
technicians to disembark. Both bows were 
subsequently positioned a suitable distance back 
from the outline of the foredeck, to protect the 
forepeaks and hull from damage, and to minimise 
the risk of the platform technicians sustaining 
crush-related injuries. 
A galley and mess are located starboard, in 
addition to laundry facilities. Benreoch can 
accommodate up to 15 crew members and 22 
technicians. The main deck features a cabin, 
which provides forward-facing seating for the 
platform technicians, as well as a captain’s cabin 
and, for crew, two cabins, featuring four and six 
berths. The remaining crew resting space is 
located in the hulls, in the form of two twin 
cabins. Crew can access the main deck from the 
hulls via a flight of stairs, which also leads to the 
wheelhouse – fitted with anti-ballistics materials 
– on the upper deck. 
Benreoch is powered by two Caterpillar C32 
Acert main engines, each rated 1,081kW at 2,000-
2,300rpm, driving twin propellers and providing 
a service speed of 26knots, increasing to 30knots 
max. Meanwhile, a pair of Caterpillar C4.4 
generators provides the vessel’s onboard electrical 
needs. The vessel has been flagged by Nigeria and 
classed by Bureau Veritas (BV), which has granted 
her BV HULL MACH, Crew Boat and Sea 
Area 2 notations.

T
he March 2015 launch of the first of two diesel-
electric driven steel hull open-top container 
vessels Clean Harbour 1 and Clean Harbour 2 
signified a bolster to Hong Kong’s hybrid power 
ambitions. The vessels were delivered to Drainage 
Services Department (DSD), HKSAR by the builder 
Wang Tak Engineering & Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.
The vessels were designed as essential components 
for daily transportation of dewatered sludge cake 
from Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works to 
the sludge treatment facility in Tuen Mun, under 
DSD Harbour Area Treatment Scheme Stage 2A. A 
total of 90 ISO 1C-type sludge containers can be 
carried inside each vessel’s two cargo holds.
The sisters were designed by Shanghai Chizhou 
Marine Tech. Ltd, with diesel-electric propulsion 
systems designed by China Shipbuilding Industry 
Corporation Shanghai Marine Diesel Engine 
Research Institute 711. Clean Harbour 1 and Clean 
Harbour 2 were built and surveyed to Lloyd’s Register 
rules and licensed as Hong Kong Marine Department 
Class IIA Dry Cargo Vessels. These are the first set of 
Hong Kong-licensed container vessels with diesel-
electric propulsion for Hong Kong service.
Electrical propulsion consists of two CEEG CSD-
900 transformers, two ABB ACS800-07-1060-7 
variable frequency devices, two ABB HXR 450L G4 
electric motors and two SJMATEK SZP75A azimuth 
thrusters. One SJMATEK SCT-90FP bow thruster 
was located at the bow for berthing assistance. The 
combination of azimuth thrusters and bow thruster 
grants each vessel superior manoeuvrability and a 
small turning circle.
To suit Hong Kong’s sea conditions and the operator’s 
requirements, the vessels were designed with different 
combinations of genset outputs that can suit different 
operating conditions during voyages, in order to 
maximise efficiency of the gensets and reduce fuel 
consumption. Apart from manual control of the gensets, 
full automatic power management is performed by 
PMS. In emergency cases, the standby genset(s) can be 
synchronised and connected to the busbar automatically.
The engine control room consists of one control 
console, with an integrated monitoring system for 
gensets, thrusters and tanks. The wheelhouse consists of 
one console with main manoeuvering control system, 
navigation aids and radio communication. The deck 
rail-mounted IHI gantry crane can perform 20 loading 
and unloading container movements per hour. Crew 
accommodations, including single and double cabins, 
are provided at the forecastle deck, with the galley and 
toilet facility located on the main deck.

F
ormed in 2010 as part of a joint venture with 
the director of Sub Aqua Design Services, 
Middlesbrough, UK-based B Marshall Marine 
Ltd was created with one particular aim – the 
self-financing and construction of a vessel 
designed specifically for offshore diving support. 
According to B Marshall Marine, this sector has 
suffered from a distinct “lack of tailor-made dive 
support craft of the right size”, especially when it 
comes to activities related to offshore renewable 
energy, survey work and general repair and 
maintenance tasks. 
This optimised-for-purpose vessel was realised 
in the form of Curtis Marshall, which left the 
blocks in March 2015, and which can be chartered 
from B Marshall Marine in association with Sub 
Aqua Diving Services. Despite her small 
dimensions, the vessel has been likened to ‘the 
Tardis’, Dr Who’s famous time-travelling police 
box, for the sheer amount of facilities she has 
managed to incorporate into her compact frame.
For instance, the 26m loa craft features: eight 
double berth cabins; a spacious, eight-seat galley; 
a utility area and a communal mess room; all 
enabling a high degree of comfort. This is an 
essential factor, given that Curtis Marshall has 
been designed to be capable of three weeks’ worth 
of self-sufficient sea time. The vessel’s safe and 
reliable working platform comprises: an onboard 
decompression chamber; integrated dive control; 
the capability to transfer ballast water between 
either of the two aft tanks and the forward tank; 
and a four-point mooring system. 
The craft is also equipped with a bespoke 
walkabout control system, which is detachable 
from the helm position and which can be used to 
control all four mooring winches, steering, 
propulsion and the bow thruster. With the 
offshore wind farm support sector in mind, the 
vessel has also been fitted with a customised 
bow fender, to protect the boat when it is 
pushing onto the wind turbine. The craft’s 
fender incorporates load cells for turbine load 
monitoring, for both the peace of mind of crew, 
and as a means of logging and producing data 
for client records. And, unlike many larger dive 
support vessels, Curtis Marshall’s compact 
nature provides the additional bonus of fuel 
economy; the vessel drinks a comparatively low 
rate of 120litres per hour.

E
rnst Meier-Hedde is the first in a series of 
three new search and rescue (SAR) boats built 
by Fassmer for the German sea rescue service, 
the DGzRS, which is on a mission to rejuvenate 
its fleet. 
Delivered in tandem with the DGzRS’ 150th 
anniversary in 2015, the 27.9m x 6.2m newbuild, 
and her forthcoming two sisters, have been 
designed and constructed with increased length, 
power and enhanced, high-end navigational and 
communications equipment, and will replace 
three of the six existing 27.5m DGzRS SAR boats 
that were originally built for the service between 
1985 and 1992. 
The new vessel has been equipped with a 
comprehensive range of medical equipment, in 
addition to a fire pump, enabling the boat to 
tackle offshore or port-based blazes. Ernst Meier-
Hedde also carries a daughter craft, named Lotte; 
she measures 8.2m x 2.9m, draws 0.8m and has a 
displacement of 4.3tonnes. Fitted with a single 
Steyr SE 236E40 engine, rated 170kW, Lotte can 
achieve a maximum speed of 19knots. 
The main vessel deploys a knife-type towing 
hook, enabling her to partake in salvage operations, 
if necessary. A pair of MTU engines drives a fixed 
propeller through ZF gearboxes, enabling the 
vessel to reach speeds of up to 24knots when called 
upon for first response work.

obbler Boats has unveiled the prototype version of its 
Gobbler 290 class of oil spill recovery craft, designed 
to be transported by road, air and vessel to spill sites in the 
quickest timeframes possible. Launched at Seawork 2015, 
the prototype of this class manages to combine compact 
and lightweight dimensions with complex and radical 
oil-skimming technology. 
Made from fibreglass and incorporating oil-resistant 
resins, the Gobbler 290 weighs 3.5tonnes, draws 450mm 
and accommodates a two-man crew. Given these specs, 
the vessel / trailer combination can be launched easily 
from her custom-built, all-terrain road trailer to deal with 
spills directly from shore.  Gobbler 290 vessels, sometimes 
including the trailer and truck, can also fit into the load 
space of various transport aircraft, for access to isolated 
areas. As such, the vessel can be put to use in a variety of 
remote and hard-to-access locations and can be launched 
in shallow waters. The boat’s wheelhouse can also be 
detached and stowed on the aft deck in the event of 
limited aircraft headroom, or for passing under low road 
bridges. 
The class also features a unique oil spill recovery set-up. 
The vessel can carry a range of oil skimmers for differing 
scenarios; one features a recovery capacity of 22tonnes per 
hour, while another is rated 40tonnes per hour, and both 
skimmer types deliver 98-100% water-free recovered oil. 
These skimmer types are located at the front of the vessel. 
Throughout its oil recovery operations, the Gobbler 290 
remains completely oil-free, save for the oil that it is 
actively recovering and handling. This recovered oil is 
pumped ‘backwards’, through the boat’s internal hoses, to 
a bollard, located on the aft deck. The bollard is connected 
to a detachable bladder that is trailed behind the boat 
during her clean-up operations – typically conducted at a 
speed of 2knots. Each bladder has a capacity of up to 
13,000litres and is infinitely reusable. Rather than having 
to make regular trips back to shore to offload recovered 
oil, the Gobbler can fill each bladder to capacity, and then 
quick-release it from the vessel’s aft for later collection, 
while applying a new, empty bladder to the deck transfer 
bollard. 
To support these operations, Gobbler Boats has also 
devised and produced a series of floating ‘bladder 
collection points’, in the form of the Quad-Pod and the 
Octo-Pod. Each features a light and AIS beacon, and is 
used to store spare bladders (eight on the Quad-Pod / 16 
on the Octo-Pod, including two spares for each group-
working vessel) The pods are weight-matched to the 
lifting capacities of various helicopters and can also be 
deployed by an accompanying mothership. Each pod also 
incorporates a refuelling facility. When the Gobbler 290 
crew has filled one bladder, they can connect it to the pod 
and then collect a spare bladder to continue their work. 
When the pods’ bladders have all been filled, they can be 
simultaneously pumped, via the pod central pumping 
system, to an accompanying mothership, and the empty 
bladders are then ready for re-use, to reduce fuel 
consumption and save time. 
The Gobbler 290 incorporates solid state technology 
and hydraulically controlled equipment throughout, 
resulting in a “better than 95% spark-free environment”, 
Gobbler Boats Ltd confirms. In the event of a flameout, 
the crew can detach the bladder from the bollard and 
make a speedy getaway from the scene. 
The Gobbler 290 is also fitted with a jet intake auto-
clean system so that, should the waterjet intake screen 
encounter an obstruction, the crew can pull a lever 
connected to the vessel’s PRM gearbox and blast the object 
out backwards. This saves the crew from having to dive 
underneath the boat to manually clear the underwater 
obstruction, and protects them from potential sub-zero 
temperatures and attacks by marine wildlife.

T
he Dockstarvet-built Gustaf AF Klint does 
not so much represent a ‘first-in-class’ vessel, 
but more a “specialised, one-off project”, in the 
words of the builder’s CEO, Anders Hellman. 
However, Hellman admitted, it was a job which 
has proven an ideal crash course in “system 
integration and electric drive installations,” 
which the yard can carry over into future orders. 
Named after a pioneer in Swedish hydrographic 
survey, who was active between 1790-1840, Gustaf 
AF Klint has been designed to specialise in ‘clear 
sweeping’ work, an offshore activity not entirely 
new to Dockstavarvet; the yard built three clear 
sweeping ships in the 1970s. This necessitates the 
vessel carrying a 30m steel beam – hinged in a 
winch system, sideways-on, across the vessel’s stern 
– which is moved at a slow speed, at a pre-set depth, 
and which registers any contact with objects on the 
seafloor. This is used for tasks where the demand for 
accuracy cannot be met with conventional multi-
beam echo-sounding technology – including areas 
such as fairways and harbour waters. 
The ship is a trimaran, fashioned purely from 
aluminium, and utilises a sole Volvo-Penta diesel 
engine, rated 558kW, and Twin Disc MGX-5204 
gearbox with trolling function, generating only 
25rpm on the propeller in dead slow mode. 
Meanwhile, the vessel’s forward and aft thrusters 
enable the ship to sail on a straight line, independent 
of wind and current, up to certain limits. 
Although most sweeping operations will be 
conducted when going forward, they will 
sometimes be conducted when going astern – for 
instance, when working against a dock wall. The 
sweep system is controlled via a mounted platform 
on the bridge, complete with two crew seats. The 
platform is rotatable; when working in astern 
mode, for example, the platform is turned 180degs. 
Gustaf AF Klint has also been fitted with a 
comprehensive electronics package, enabling 
the crew to register signals from the sensors on 
the steel beam and the beam winches, as well as 
positional and depth data. Altogether, about 50 
sensors and antennas have been installed 
aboard the vessel, as have some 20 computers, 
with presentations accessible via 10 monitors. 
The main deck level of the deckhouse contains 
a workshop and a stores room for survey 
equipment, as well as mess, toilet/washroom and 
berth facilities for the crew. An A-frame, capable 
of lifting 1,500kg, is fitted on the aft deck for 
handling of the workboat, a ROV and/or a 10ft 
container. The vessel’s windlass, A-frame, sensor 
system and winch system for the beam, as well as 
the entire control system for main engine and 
thrusters, were designed and delivered by Petters 
Marine Hydraulic (PMH). The system contains 
functions for six different modes: conventional 
manoeuvring with rudder and propellers; 
joystick mode; keep position (fixed on one 
spot); ‘slow speed track’ (while sweeping at 
speeds up to 2knots); ‘high speed track’ in 
speeds of up to 8knots, for multi-beam 
sounding work; and transit mode on auto-pilot. 
The sensor and manoeuvring systems have also 
been integrated with the SMA’s shore-based 
systems for position fixing and registration of 
depth data.

D
esigned and built in Thailand – by Albatross 
Marine Design (AMD) and Bakricono 
Shipyard, respectively – the concept behind the 
new Heliotrope 48 (H48) class is to match eye-
catching shapes and striking colours with 
practical functionality and operational efficiency, 
so as to create a genuinely unique entrant to the 
power catamaran yacht market. This market has 
undergone a surge of popularity in recent years, 
and remains a potential growth area for yachting 
enthusiasts who may not be able to afford the ‘full 
trimmings’ of a luxury yacht, but whose wallets 
can stretch to a quality recreational vessel that 
does not require the presence of permanent crew, 
nor extensive mooring fees. 
However, AMD has been keen to ensure that 
the H48 is not mistaken for a ‘marina-based 
houseboat’, but instead fulfils her role as a 
performance-oriented model. The cat’s hull form 
was developed following detailed resistance 
studies, incorporating CFD methods, to provide 
fuel efficiency and soft rides across a wide range 
of semi-planing speeds. Special attention was also 
paid to the bridge deck configuration, as Dr 
Albert Nazarov, AMD managing director, 
recounts. “On many pleasure cats, the bunks are 
located at the bridge [or wet] deck level, 
commonly between the demi-hulls,” he explains. 
“This means the designers have to reduce bridge 
deck height above waterline, often compromising 
the seakeeping.
“With the H48, we did not place any beds on the 
bridge deck. As a result, we can raise 25% of the 
forward area of the bridge deck, thus improving 
the seakeeping and reducing possible slamming 
on the seaway.” Additionally, the cat’s propellers 
and rudders are protected by skegs, facilitating 
beaching of the vessel. 
Vacuum infusion was used to assemble the 
H48’s hull structure, drawing on a mixture of 
composites such as vinyl ester resin, multiaxial 
E-glass fabrics and Airex foam core. Below 
waterline, Lantor Soric bulking mats have been 
applied to the hull, and the cross structure has 
been reinforced, with unidirectional tape, in areas 
prone to slamming. This approach has succeeded 
in keeping overall weight down, whilst resulting 
in a sturdy and reliable fast vessel.  
The H48 can be configured for different 
requirements. For instance, the ‘charter’ version 
of the craft offers four double cabins and four 
toilets, with two shared shower rooms; the 
‘master’ option, meanwhile, can be made to 
feature a cabin and bathroom on one side of the 
vessel, with two guest blocks on the other. 
Featuring a 22m² flybridge, which opens up into 
the saloon to form a single functional zone, and 
with interior headroom pushed up to 2.2m, the 
vessel offers ample space for a variety of onboard 
activities.

L
ast year, Significant Small Ships featured the 
October 2014 delivery of the 26.7m x 9.1m 
Seacat Intrepid, the first in South Boats Isle of 
Wight’s (IOW’s) new breed of South Cat 26 
vessels. That vessel was the result of a detailed 
assessment programme, studying the merits of 
various crew transfer vessel (CTV) hull forms, 
including SWATH, semi-SWATH, fine entry 
catamaran, full buoyancy catamaran and ‘D’ 
bow designs. As a result of both theoretical 
testing, and trials conducted with self-propelled 
models, South Boats IOW – assisted by 
consultants – drew up an analysis of each hull 
form’s strengths and weaknesses, resulting in the 
development of the South Cat 26 and 23 classes. 
The first of the 23m class, Iceni Venture, was 
delivered in April 2015, initially undertaking 
work with SSE at the 500MW Greater Gabbard 
offshore wind park, UK. Ben Colman, sales and 
marketing manager at South Boats IOW, says 
that the idea behind the South Cat 23m class was 
to create a vessel capable of performing better 
than, or equal to, larger CTVs, albeit without the 
expenditure typically associated with larger 
vessels. 
Last year, Colman commented: “Modelling 
data shows the 23m to have five times better 
seakeeping [measured by slams per hour in 
equal conditions] than 26m designs of our 
competitors.” He was backed up by Richard 
Thurlow, director, Iceni Marine Services, who 
added: “For its size and cost, the vessel is 
punching well above its weight, and, in my 
opinion, sets a new standard for this size of 
CTV.”
Powered by twin MAN V12 main engines, the 
vessel has proven capable, in sea trials, of 
achieving sprint speeds of 32knots and a 
continuous service speed in excess of 29knots at 
85% engine load. The vessel can reportedly 
maintain this performance whilst facing wave 
heights of more than 1.25m Hs, in any direction. 
Since her delivery date, Iceni Marine Services 
estimates that Iceni Venture has gained a number 
of sail days that would have previously been 
written off as ‘weather down’ days. By enabling 
working transfers of up to 2.5m, the vessel has 
also increased its scope of availability for charter 
during the winter months. South Boats IOW has 
calculated the vessel’s average fuel burn rate as 
being approximately 200-220litres per hour. 
Iceni Venture was followed by the delivery of 
Iceni Vengeance, another unit built for Iceni 
Marine Services. The third and fourth additions 
to the South Cat 23m range, however – Seacat 
Mischief and Seacat Magic – have been produced 
for long-running South Boats IOW partner and 
operator Seacat Services.

elivered 
to 
Norwegian 
Sea 
Rescue 
(Redningsselskapet, or RS) in October 2013, 
stemming from a US$3.5 million donation from the 
Ulstein Group, this 22m aluminum craft design is 
based on RS’ and builder Swede Ship’s accumulated 
knowledge and experiences, resulting in a top of the 
line vessel with all the latest technology. 
Idar Ulstein has a target speed of 38knots and the 
capability to exceed 40knots. She is designed for 
operation up to 200m from shore, primarily in 
undertaking open-sea SAR operations. Her large 
wheelhouse, with glued windows, allows for 
360degs visibility and its resiliently mounted design 
wheelhouse has resulted in low noise levels, with 
just over 60dB(A) recorded at maximum ship speed. 
The comfort level in the wheelhouse is intended 
to prevent fatigue for the three-man crew. Below 
deck, the cabin was designed mainly for rest and 
not for long overnight trips. Three bunk beds, a 
galley and WC with shower are available. In 
between the crew area and the engine room is the 
technical room, which is equipped with a work 
bench and complete set of hand tools. The engine 
room contains the 12V2000 series MTU main 
engines, a diesel generator and a hydraulic 
generator set. 
The wheelhouse has three operating stations: one 
facing aft, intended for use in towing operations; 
and two normal positions facing forward, which 
are fully redundant and equipped with all the latest 
equipment for modern navigation and systems 
supervision, presented on four 26” screens. The 
radars are of military type and standard, to enable 
the captain to see small objects floating on the 
water surface. The wheelhouse is also equipped 
with a medical bench, for casualty treatment.
The hull has been designed for 6G at the 
longitudinal COG and 13G at the bow. However, 
when the crew are in their suspension seats, 
members should not experience acceleration 
forces higher than approximately 2-3G.

K
aroline has been hailed as the world’s first battery-
driven fishing vessel, developed by Norwegian 
boatbuilder Selfa Arctic. The builder specialises in the 
production of fishing vessels fashioned from fibreglass, 
via vacuum infusion, and is, at present, the only 
Norwegian boatbuilder entitled to approve its own 
newbuilds, as decided by the Norwegian Maritime 
Authority. 
In 2007, Selfa Arctic initiated a project with the aim of 
developing environmentally friendly products and 
contributing to the global, industry-wide effort to curb 
vessel emissions. In collaboration with SINTEF and FHF 
(the former being Scandinavia’s largest independent 
research organisation; the latter being The Norwegian 
Seafood Research Fund) a ‘pre-project’ was initiated in 
2009. The result was a base calculation of the energy 
needed for a hybrid fishing vessel to carry out operations. 
Based on the results of this study, Selfa Arctic then 
began to search for a suitable European component 
supplier, and entered into cooperation with Siemens in 
Trondheim, located 1.5km from Selfa’s boatyard. The 
main project commenced in 2013 and was partially 
funded by Transnova (now Enova) and the Norwegian 
Research Council.
Karoline has been equipped with a Volvo Penta D4-180 
generator, which drives a Siemens electric motor, 
generating an output of 60kW at 2,400rpm. This also 
charges a 195kW battery bank, supplied by Corvus. As a 
result, the boat can carry out typical fishing vessel 
operations on battery power,  which, for the fisherman, 
means drastically reduced noise, vibrations and toxic 
fumes. Steaming in and out can either be conducted via 
battery, or with the Siemens motor. The boat can be 
charged by a standard 63A cable when docked, with 
charging times estimated to last between six and eight 
hours.
During 2014 and 2015, the propulsion system was built 
on the floor at the Siemens plant in Trondheim and tested 
during the winter. The propulsion system and battery 
were subsequently installed in spring 2015. The boat was 
put to sea at the beginning of August and presented at 
Aqua Nor and then put through its paces in a 600nm sea 
trial, on a route between Trondheim and Tromsø.

E
merging in the wake of the European marine 
sector’s 
current 
‘electric 
renaissance’, 
L’escapade joins the many passenger vessels 
within this territory to have selected hybrid 
diesel-electric power for operations. The vessel’s 
construction has also involved what builder 
Alumarine terms a “pooling of European know-
hows”, 
with 
the 
vessel’s 
diesel 
engine 
manufactured 
in 
Sweden, 
her 
battery 
management system sourced from the UK, her 
naval architecture provided by Belgium, her 
batteries delivered from Germany and her hybrid 
control system made in Italy. 
The 27.8m x 5.05m vessel, which is capable of 
accommodating up to 102 passengers at sea – or 
60 persons whilst undertaking an onboard 
restaurant service – has been fitted with a Volvo 
D5 engine, rated 118kW at 2,300rpm, linked to a 
Transfluid HM2000 hybrid transmission and a 
Transfluid Powershift Revermatic 11-700RBD 
drive, featuring a reduction ratio of 1.88.  The 
electric engine is rated 75kW and derives its 
power courtesy of a 150kW lithium phosphate 
battery pack, supplied by Exide FeLiPO, and 
enables the operator to switch between diesel and 
electric modes; the latter mode not only curbing 
emissions and fumes, but also for drastically 
reducing noise, leading to silent river operations 
and a noise level of no more than 58dB within the 
passenger area. This factor was a prime stipulation 
for her operations in the picturesque province of 
Oise, France.
In diesel mode, the vessel can attain a top speed 
of 10knots and a cruising speed of 7.5knots at 
1,800rpm. In electric mode, the cruising speed 
would be in the region of 4.3knots, with the 
electric engine performing at 900rpm, increasing 
to 7.5knots at 1,800rpm max. Vessel trials proved 
L’escapade to have a range of 20 hours when 
operating at 5.4knots in pure electric mode. 
The boat has been fashioned from 
aluminium,with operational flexibility built in; 
for instance, the passenger deck can be converted 
into a restaurant and reception room. The aft 
deck features a functional catering zone, and an 
outside folding roof terrace can accommodate up 
to 20 people. Passengers can stow their bicycles at 
a dedicated area at the bow.
In all, the launch and delivery of L’escapade 
adds to the many deliveries this year (and over 
the past five years) that have proven that the rise 
of green craft technology is no flash-in-the-pan 
fad, and that it is possible to run a commercial 
passenger service, at optimum river cruising 
speed, whilst reducing emissions, noise and fuel 
oil consumption.

escribed as a ‘maid of all work’ and a floating 
‘Swiss Army Knife’, due to her versatility when it 
comes to riverine operations, the UK Port of London 
Authority’s (PLA’s) maintenance vessel London Titan, 
delivered in June 2015, represents the authority’s single 
largest investment in 20 years, boasting a value of £6.9 
million (US$11.5 million). 
London Titan’s rota of tasks includes, but is not 
restricted to, mooring maintenance, buoy laying, 
dive support, pile removal, plough dredging and 
wreckage removal across the PLA’s 95-mile 
jurisdiction on the River Thames. Designed by 
Aberdeenshire-based naval architect Macduff Ship 
Design and constructed by Dorset builder Manor 
Marine, the 36.5m loa London Titan has effectively 
replaced two 1960s-built PLA craft, Hookness and 
Crossness, resulting in a modernised vessel with 
reduced overall operating costs. 
The original contract for the vessel stems back to 
January 2012, reflecting the attention that Macduff 
Ship Design and the PLA devoted to getting the 
vessel exactly right for her environment. Practical 
considerations included the creation of a shallow 
draught (the completed vessel has attained a 
maximum draught of 2.2m) and relatively ‘squat’ 
shape, so as to enable the vessel to pass under the 
many bridges encountered on the Thames, albeit 
with the capability to operate efficiently in open 
water stretches. Additionally, Macduff’s team spent 
time aboard the outgoing duo Hookness and 
Crossness, to create as ergonomic an interior 
environment as possible for the crew. 
Additional features aboard London Titan include: a 
pair of large articulated cranes; spud legs, located 
forward and aft of the starboard / port cranes, 
respectively, and installed as a less time-consuming 
alternative to anchors; a pair of large articulated cranes; 
and superior winch capacity to her two predecessors. A 
towed plough dredge, deployed over the stern by a 
gantry, enables the vessel to undertake dredging duties. 
Consilium UK has designed and installed London 
Titan's full bridge navigation package, which it did to 
meet international shipping regulations for vessels of 
more than 400gt – another rarity for vessels navigating 
the River Thames, and a feature that could see the 
Lloyd’s Register-classed ship deployed in other 
locations/regions if necessary.

U
K builder CTruk continues to transplant the 
knowledge it has accumulated in offshore 
wind farm support vessel design and construction 
into new avenues. 
Just two years after making its Significant Small 
Ships debut (in 2011) with the 18.5m crew 
transfer vessel CWind Athenia, the builder 
featured again in the journal with the completion 
of its prototype Twin Hulled Offshore Raider 
(THOR) model. This year, the group has stepped 
up to the plate with the January 2016 delivery of 
its first hydrographic survey boat to date. 
Constructed for the Port of London Authority 
(PLA), the 17m x 6.1m Maplin is based on 
CTruk’s MPC19 catamaran class, which has won 
plaudits for its seakeeping characteristics and 
notable levels of stability within the offshore wind 
farm services sector. Marrying corrosion-free 
composite design to a catamaran hull form, the 
vessel is intended to serve as a low-maintenance 
and relatively lightweight survey vessel, albeit one 
with sufficient deck space to enable a wide range 
of onboard activities. 
This enhanced stability is particularly intended 
to increase Maplin’s surveying capability; for 
instance, in allowing more effective use of the 
multi-beam deployable sonar unit that has been 
built into the hull, CTruk says.
The deck area, strengthened to accommodate 
loads of up to 1tonne per m², has been fitted with 
multiple fixing points, which enable the crew to 
lash and carry additional storage – for instance, 
small buoys, lifted aboard by the vessel’s 
Bonfiglioli 2300 crane. 
The wheelhouse has also been built with a low 
profile, and Maplin’s mast made retractable, to 
facilitate the vessel’s passage through waterways 
subject to low bridges. Her low draught will 
enable the vessel to pass under London Bridge. 
Maplin has also been designed with a RIB 
recovery A-frame, thereby enabling the crew to 
launch and recover a 4m daughter craft. She is set 
to replace the PLA’s 1955-built survey boat 
Yantlet, which is reaching retirement.

N
eil Armstrong is the first in class of a new pair 
of research vessels constructed for the 
University National Oceanographic Laboratory 
System (UNOLS) fleet. Neil Armstrong and sister 
ship Sally Ride are both auxiliary general 
oceanographic research ships and will be operated 
by Woods Hole Institution of Oceanography and 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, respectively. 
Both vessels were designed by GPA in Seattle, 
Washington, US, and constructed by Dakota 
Creek Industries (DCI), also of Washington. 
The GPA/DCI team strategy for the design of the 
Armstrong class was to meet all critical and 
optional requirements set forth in the specification 
developed by the US Navy Office of Naval Research 
(ONR) and the UNOLS group. While final 
dimensions were dependent on specification-
derived values and space required for desired 
features, there were also various operational 
characteristics required in the specification. One of 
the more critical of these is the prevention bubble 
sweep-down, which requires a hull form design 
that discourages flow in way of the bow wake from 
carrying bubbles generated by the ship’s entry 
downward, toward the instrumentation array 
located near the mid-ship bottom centerline.
Vibration and noise transmission throughout the 
hull was another critical operational design 
element. It was important to prevent mechanically 
induced noise on and vibrations from affecting the 
crew and scientific personnel during their work 
and resting hours, as well as to prevent adverse 
effects on onboard sensitive scientific equipment 
and the marine environment surrounding the 
vessel. Structural design, including global hull 
structural analysis and large counterweighted 
foundations for the main generator sets, along with 
shock mountings on vibrating equipment and 
vibration-attenuating coatings, were all employed 
to ensure that all vibration criteria were met or 
exceeded. DCI and GPA collaborated with Noise 
Control Engineering (NCE) to engineer these 
solutions and validate that these measures were 
effective. The vessels also ensure minimised effect 
on the environment by way of both locating all 
drains and outflows on the port side (opposite the 
side handling gear and ROV hangar entry), and by 
the capability to have zero outflow or drainage 
overboard for up to 72 hours.
Neil Armstrong is capable of a sustained speed of 
12knots with a range of 11,500nm. The vessel can 
provide 11.3tonnes of towing force at 4knots and 
4.5tonnes at 6 knots in sea state 4 conditions. Neil 
Armstrong and Sally Ride are powered by twin AC 
motors controlled by variable frequency drives 
provided by Siemens, and propelled by two 
controllable-pitch Hundested propellers. This 
arrangement maximises fuel efficiency over a 
broad operating profile, which includes use of a 
tunnel stern thruster and a Tees White Gill 
azimuthing disc bow thruster for station-keeping, 
while also providing a high degree of control over 
propeller-induced noise. 
For subsea research, the Armstrong class is 
capable of being fitted with a wide array of subsea 
sensors and sonar equipment on a number of 
through-hull fittings and array foundations in the 
transducer room. The transducer room is also 
equipped with various sea chests and a larger 
overhead for the movement of scientific equipment 
to be defined in future years. Flexibility in this 
space and throughout the design is important in 
allowing the Armstrong class to adapt to as many 
different type of missions as possible.

T
he Ocean Eagle 43 (OE43) is a new class of 
offshore patrol vessel, taking the form of a 
trimaran 
or 
stabilised 
monohull 
and 
incorporating a number of ocean-racing yacht / 
power trimaran features into its overall design. 
The eye-catching vessel’s concept matches a 
slender main hull to floats, for increased 
stability, range and seakeeping, as well as 
reduced energy draw and fuel consumption. 
Stemming from a collaboration between the 
CMN Cherbourg yard in France, UK naval 
architect Nigel Irens Design, R&D specialist 
SeaTeam Aviation and operator ProLarge, the 
OE43 and her two sisters were developed for 
operation in Mozambique, where they will 
primarily undertake fisheries protection and 
coastal surveillance operations. 
The trio was launched in 2015; as Significant 
Small Ships of 2015 went to press, the three 
completed vessels were in Cherbourg, where 
their future crew members (including the 
skippers) are undergoing comprehensive 
training, prior to their imminent delivery. 
The OE43 has been described by Nigel Irens 
Design as a “logical extension” of its previous 
power trimaran offerings, which include the 
34.4m, 1998-built Cable & Wireless Adventurer, 
the first craft to circumnavigate the world 
within 74 days. Measuring 43.6m x 15.7m, the 
OE43 is capable of efficient operation across a 
range of speeds; whether sprinting or relocating 
at speeds of up to 30knots, or long-range 
cruising; in the latter case, the OE43 has 
recorded a range of more than 3,000nm when 
travelling at 18knots, and a range of 5,000nm  
at 12knots. 
One of the biggest design challenges 
concerned the development of the main and 
float hull forms. Nigel Irens states: 
“Considerable work was undertaken on the 
distribution of volume in the hulls both above 
and below the waterline, in order to find the 
optimum balance between performance and 
seakeeping.” Equally, the floats received special 
attention and were tweaked to extract the best 
desired stability characteristics whilst keeping 
resistance to a minimum. The end result, Nigel 
Irens recalls, was a patrol craft “more akin to a 
monohull than a catamaran”. 
For additional weight reduction (and 
subsequent fuel reduction), the OE43 was 
constructed from lightweight composites – 
Nigel Irens explains: “The infusion of the main 
hulls set a new record for a cored epoxy hull 
infused in one shot.” CMN Cherbourg, 
meanwhile, manufactured the new class of 
vessels’ machinery and systems, to ensure 
accurate weight control. 
To top things off, the OE43 has the capacity 
to carry, launch and recover a fast-response, 
7m-long RIB, featuring a speed of 40knots, and 
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a deck 
securing system. This configuration enables a 
wide range of security-related tasks to be 
undertaken, including anti-piracy / anti-
smuggling operations and search and rescue.

(Kihnu Virve, delivered in October 2015, and 
Soela, scheduled for delivery in 2017) will be 
operating. The ferry is powered by a pair of MTU 
8V4000 engines, each producing 1,000kW of 
power and feeding Rolls-Royce azimuth thrusters. 
Two Volvo Penta generators have also been 
installed, to provide additional onboard power. 
Together, this arrangement grants the vessel an 
operating speed of 15knots when operating in 
calm water, and 3knots when ploughing through 
450mm of solid ice. 
Ormsö and her sisters have also been developed 
with adaptability in mind. For instance, the 
design enables the owner to install a twin deck, if 
needs be, thus creating a second car level that can 
accommodate an extra 10 cars.

O
ssOy is the first vessel in Sinopacific 
Shipbuilding’s SPA150 class, and constitutes 
the first medium-sized anchor handling tug 
supply (AHTS) vessel in the builder’s in-house SP 
series. Featuring just under 9,000kW of 
propulsive power,  a Class 2 dynamic positioning 
system (DP2) and a 150tonne bollard pull, the 
vessel is suitable for a variety of offshore tasks, 
including tug work, anchoring, external fire-
fighting, oil spill response and recovery and 
loading various liquids and dry cargoes. 
The vessels in the SPA series have been rolled out 
for the rapidly expanding owner and operator Far 
East Marine Company (Femco), which, since its 
establishment in 1998, has come to oversee a 
current fleet of 11 AHTS vessels, two dry cargo 
vessels and one fast support craft. Sinopacific 
comments: “The design team has been able to offer 
flexibility and specific configurations for each 
vessel, so as to customise each one to Femco’s 
specific demands.”
Sinopacific collaborated closely with Rolls-Royce 
Marine, from the earliest stage of the design 
process, to create an optimised propulsive solution 
for the SPA150 series. Reportedly, this is the first 
time that Rolls-Royce has provided integrated 
equipment packages for vessels on build in China 
that were not of that company’s own design. 
OssOy is arranged as a single-deck vessel, with 
machinery and accommodation units (including 
36 cabins) located forward. Other design features 
include a bulbous bow, intended to significantly 
reduce wave resistance when the 72m x 17.2m 
vessel is sailing in transit, thereby providing a 
bulwark against excessive fuel consumption and 
strengthening the vessel’s ‘green’ credentials.

M
id-sized crewboat specialist Penguin Shipyard 
International rolled out the latest innovation in 
its line of ‘Flex’ vessels in Q2 2015, with the delivery 
of two of its new Flex-45 class fast supply intervention 
vessels (FSIVs), including the debutante Pelican 
Pride, to Pelican Offshore, the shipowning subsidiary 
of Penguin International Limited.  
Designed by Penguin Shipyard, the Flex-45 
Executive FSIV is powered by four mechanically 
controlled Baudouin M26.2 main engines with a 
combined output of 3,580kW. Performance-wise, the 
Flex-45 is not designed to be a high-end, high-speed, 
high-cost FSIV. Instead, it is designed to transport 
personnel and cargo economically and efficiently, 
while offering “executive levels” of comfort, Penguin 
claims. The overall effect, the designer and builder 
adds, is one of “style meets sensibility”. 
The vessel has a respectable top speed of 
27knots with 45dwt and a corresponding fuel 
consumption of just 840litres per hour. At 
economical speed, the fuel consumption drops to 
a modest 680litres per hour. The FSIV’s 135m² 
clear deck area can transport up to 80tonnes of 
cargo and includes a Palfinger knuckle-boom 
crane as standard equipment.
Despite taking an economical approach, Penguin 
Shipyard has not skimped on creature comforts. 
For example, each Flex-45 comes with 60 reclinable 
business class seats as a standard feature, plus four 
crew cabins with a total of 10 bunks. 
And, should the Flex-45 be required to undertake 
firefighting duties , the Flex-45 is equipped with 
two FiFi monitors capable of throwing out 1200m³ 
of seawater per hour.
“The Flex-45 is designed to be economical to 
own and operate, and comfortable to ride and 
sleep in,” James Tham, managing director of 
Penguin International Limited, parent company of 
Penguin Shipyard, states. “This is an FSIV that 
makes good economic sense, considering the 
current state of the offshore industry.”

T
he offshore market may have remained 
stagnant in 2015, but innovative solutions 
continue to abound, as is evident in the 
delivery of the Shipyard De Hoop-designed 
and –built multipurpose OSV Prince Job I. 
Developed to operate in Chevron’s offshore oil 
fields near Nigeria, the 68.5m vessel’s duties 
include the discharge of transmix liquids; 
although such work is usually handled by 
tankers, draught restrictions affecting the 
operational zone have made these latter vessel 
types unsuitable. Similarly, tankers would 
prove poor platforms for Prince Job I’s other 
stipulated tasks, such as transportation of deck 
cargo and inspection, repair and maintenance 
(IRM) and firefighting operations. IRM work is 
especially important, given that the transmix 
liquids are being pumped from the offshore 
site to shore via a single Chevron pipeline; this 
pipeline must be kept in optimal working 
order, and repaired, should any defects occur, 
in order to reduce the likelihood of accidents, 
which could include life-threatening incidents 
such as explosions. 
The vessel’s cargo area spans some 500m² and 
has been strengthened to 5tonnes per m², with 
container fittings and lashing points enabling her 
to accommodate a containerised cargo equivalent 
to 16teu. Two Sormec offshore knuckle boom 
cranes, each rated 10tonnes at an outreach of 
15m, have been installed to assist hose-handling 
and loading/unloading operations. For 
maximum, unobstructed access across the cargo 
deck, the superstructure has been situated as far 
forward as possible, De Hoop explains.
Prince Job I has been fitted with four inflatable 
life rafts, split equally between the port and 
starboard sides, each featuring the capacity for 25 
persons, and an aluminium workboat. Should the 
vessel be called on to tackle fires, a pair of electric 
pumps, each with a capacity of 1.5 million litres, 
can feed two monitors with a combined capacity 
of 2.4 million litres per hour. This set-up has 
earned the vessel DNV-GL FiFi 1 status. 
The superstructure consists of 4.5 levels and 
contains the wheelhouse (with the bridge split into 
a forward-facing section, for vessel transit, and an 
aft-facing section, where DP-relevant operations 
are conducted) and 10 cabins, providing 
accommodation for up to 30 crew members.

J
une 2015 saw the handover of the 32m RT 
Emotion, the next-generation ART80-32 
Rotortug built by Damen and designed by an 
alliance of Rotortug B.V, in the Netherlands, 
and Canada-based naval architect Robert Allan 
Ltd. RT Emotion has subsequently been hailed 
as the first hybrid tug to operate within 
German waters.
The key drive behind this class has been to 
blend 
environmentally 
clean, 
hybrid 
technology with high performance and 
significant pulling power. Dubbed the 
‘E-KOTUG’ series, the designer and builder 
claim 50% less harmful emissions, notable 
noise reduction, cleaner combustion and 
substantial maintenance savings thanks to the 
vessel’s improved fuel economy. The tug’s 
XeroPoint hybrid propulsion system oversees 
three electric motors and the Corvus-supplied 
battery pack. 
The ART80-32’s optimised hull shape enables 
ahead and astern speeds of more than 13knots 
and, in terms of bollard pull, the tug can 
achieve 84tonnes over the stern and 82tonnes 
over the bow. Similarly, versatility and 
flexibility were key considerations; as KOTUG 
puts it, the “ability to respond very quickly to 
changes in manoeuvring requirements” was of 
prime importance when developing the tug as a 
“highly responsive” addition to its fleet.

S
istac Vitoria is a purpose-built, RINA-classed, 
DP-2 monohull dive support boat, intended 
for service in Brazilian offshore waters. The 
aluminium vessel’s aft working deck contains 
multiple A-frame assembles with integrated 
winches for ROV and dive bell launching / 
retrieval,  in addition to a knuckle boom crane 
designed to handle deck gear. This area also 
contains a small rescue vessel, and features a 
lower platform at the stern, to facilitate direct 
access to the sea by diving personnel. Centrally 
located on the aft deck is a dive shop and dive 
control centre. 
The main deckhouse interior houses an 
emergency generator space, a decompression 
chamber, an office, a crew entertainment room 
(with TV), a meeting room, lunch room, galley 
and pantry. Three single-berth cabins, featuring 
en-suite bathrooms, are provided for personnel in 
positions of seniority. 
Meanwhile, below decks, a series of two-, three- 
and four-berth cabins, also with an en-suite 
bathroom apiece, are dedicated to the 33 crew 
and dive personnel aboard the vessel. The 
wheelhouse contains both forward- and aft-
facing controls and a pair of remote operated 
vehicle (ROV) control stations, as well as lockers 
for storage and a refreshment centre. Ahead of 
the wheelhouse, Sistac Vitoria’s fore deck provides 
a landing area, in which the vessel can 
accommodate a man-riding basket, capable of 
transferring persons between the ship and 
offshore platforms/structures, and of handling 
supplies and small items of cargo. 
Four Scania DI13 main engines drive Hamilton 
HM521 waterjets through ZF 665 gearboxes. 
Station-keeping and vessel manoeuvrability have 
been enhanced by the addition of three 
Thrustmaster 30TT200 tunnel bow thrusters, 
each rated 150kW, while main electrical power is 
provided courtesy of four Scania DI13 gensets, 
each generating 375kW.

A
s part of its fleet renovation programme, the 
Port of Tauranga Limited, New Zealand, 
took delivery of a pair of tug newbuilds, 
constructed in China to a customised version of 
Robert Allan Ltd’s (RAL’s) RAmparts 2400W 
class design. Tai Pari was delivered in June 2015 
(her sole sister, Tai Timu, followed hot on her 
heels later on in the month), with design input 
based on the Port of Tauranga’s operational 
specifications. The contract was certainly a 
significant one for Cheoy Lee, being its first RAL-
designed construction project to date. 
The now familiar RAmparts hull design 
incorporates an enhanced dead rise for superior 
seakeeping, as well as RAL’s conically shaped 
double chine stern for effective control and vessel 
stability at high speed. The Port additionally 
requested a vessel type that would be capable of 
towing, albeit with a high side stepping speed. As 
a result, RAL conducted a detailed CFD study to 
determine the optimal skeg geometry to yield the 
desired effects. Tests were conducted, utilising 
modelled Z-drive thrusters and rotating 
propellers. Another challenge was to restrict the 
hull length, so that it would fall under the 24m 
rule length for load line and tonnage conventions. 
With environmental protection in mind, Tai 
Pari’s main Caterpillar 3516C engines, each rated 
2,350kW at 1,800rpm, are ‘C’ rated, compliant 
with IMO Tier II guidelines. Tai Pari has also 
been fitted with firefighting equipment, including 
a single centrifugal pump, which is fed by the port 
main engine, and a forward-mounted monitor, 
the latter featuring a dispersal capacity of 1,200m³ 
per hour. 
Tai Pari and Tai Timu can each accommodate 
up to six members of crew. Each tug’s forward 
lower deck houses a pair of two-man crew rooms, 
complete with laundry and washroom facilities; 
meanwhile, the master and chief engineer enjoy 
their own individual cabins on the main deck.

I
n the words of her captain, Turbine Transfers’ 
crew transport catamaran Trearddur Bay is 
neither a “prop boat, nor a jet boat” but “drives 
better than either”. Designed by BMT Nigel Gee 
and built by Aluminium Marine Consultants 
(AMC), the vessel, which completed her sea trials 
in February, has captured attention by virtue of 
being the first boat – let alone offshore wind farm 
support craft – to install and utilise Voith Turbo’s 
new Voith Linear Jet (VLJ) propulsion technology. 
The VLJ is an advanced ducted propeller, which 
was selected for its ability to assist the boat in 
substantially reducing fuel consumption and 
noise and vibration, whilst offering enhanced 
range and speed. Integral to the VLJ’s design is a 
stator, positioned in the duct aft of the propellers, 
in a similar fashion to waterjets. This design 
results in ‘jet’-style water flow, rather than flow in 
circular motions. 
The product features 750kg nozzles, fashioned 
from stainless steel, which are positioned in front 
of a pair of rudders, manufactured by Clements 
Engineering.  Together, the VLJ and the vessel’s 
resiliently mounted superstructure have kept 
noise levels aboard Trearddur Bay down to 62dB. 
Despite an original specified top speed of 
27knots, Trearddur Bay has managed to achieve 
nearly 32knots when pushed to the limit. The 
presence of the VLJ has also enabled Trearddur 
Bay’s crew to ramp up the vessel’s bollard pull 
(bp) to 12.4tonnes, nearly double the amount that 
would have been possible with conventional jets. 
The jet also assists in fuel conservation when the 
boat is pushing onto the turbine, damping out 
vessel motion and potentially requiring just 50% 
of the power typically required by offshore wind 
farm support craft during this operation. 
Her higher speeds, meanwhile, offer similar 
cost advantages to the operator. “Feedback 
suggests that the crew is managing to complete 
journeys about half an hour quicker than usual,” 
says Rob Stewart, AMC commercial director. 
“The reduced draw on fuel also means that 
Trearddur Bay only has to refuel every second 
day, thereby saving a dramatic amount of time 
and expense.” 
The vessel’s forward deck has been equipped 
with a Hercules pressure washing system, while 
the aft deck has been fitted with sockets, 
enabling the storage and transportation of a 10ft 
container. Trearddur Bay’s bridge electronics 
were supplied by Boat Electrics, in a package 
comprising Class A AIS, autopilot, SART, 
EPIRB, radio, GPS compasses and man 
overboard (MOB) location systems.

L
ouisiana is one of the US’ most thriving 
boatbuilding hubs at present, and New Iberia-
based Geo Shipyard added to the state’s tally in 
2015 with the launch and delivery of the 19.8m 
loa aluminium catamaran research vessel Trident. 
Like a fellow entrant in this year’s Significant 
Small Ships (see London Titan, pages 42-43), 
Trident has been described as a ‘Swiss Army 
Knife’ in lieu of her versatile nature, enabling a 
number of research-related and academic studies 
to be conducted on board, as well as providing a 
platform for training. 
Reported to be the first new vessel that the 
University of Texas, based in Galveston, has 
ordered in  40 years, Trident has been developed 
to operate 24/7 for up to five days, between port 
calls, and to travel up to 200nm from shore. The 
vessel has been fitted with a 22.3m² dry lab, 
replete with computer facilities, and boasts a 
spacious aft deck capable of holding a wet lab 
counter, comprising a deep sink with fresh  /salt 
water taps and a fresh water shower. Trident’s rear 
cargo deck measures some 34.8m². 
Deck equipment includes: a DT Marine-
manufactured DT303EM survey/trawl winch and 
an aluminium A-frame; a 2tonne-capacity 
knuckle boom crane with a maximum reach of 
6.86m; a fire pump, supported by two fire 
stations; and a 4.6m inflatable RIB. The inclusion 
of two Wesmar V2 thrusters is intended to 
enhance Trident’s manoeuvrability, especially in 
areas where space is restricted. Kobelt supplied 
the vessel’s steering system. 
Inside, three staterooms accommodate 12 beds, 
and scientist passengers / students / trainees can 
also take advantage of the pilothouse, a galley and 
a mess dining area. The main Scania 13litre diesel 
engines, rated 373kW apiece, connect to 
812.8mm x 1,067mm ZF four-bladed nibral 
wheels through ZF 360 marine gears with 2:48:1 
reduction ratios. Together with the vessel’s twin 
Wesmar V2 thrusters, this propulsion package 
grants Trident a cruising speed of 17knots, 
increasing to 23knots max.

T
he launch and delivery of the 27.4m x 10m 
offshore wind park crew transfer vessel 
(CTV) Umoe Ventus ticked off a number of 
‘firsts’, as: the first-in-class in a new series of 
‘Wave Craft’ high-speed CTVs; the first renewable 
energy support vessel to be supported by the 
Carbon Trust’; and the first of these vessel types 
to be put together by Norwegian designer and 
boatbuilder Umoe Mandal. 
The genesis of Umoe Ventus  can be traced back to 
2010, when the Carbon Trust launched a ship design 
competition to address the key challenge of how 
best to enable wind turbine technicians to safely 
access /operate on farms located in deeper waters. 
The Carbon Trust’s Offshore Wind Accelerator 
(OWA) programme, set up in 2008, has worked 
alongside a number of energy companies – 
including DONG Energy, Statoil, Scottish Power 
and E.ON – to develop new solutions for the 
offshore wind farm support sector.
The winner of the ship design competition, 
selected from 450 entries, was the Wave Craft class 
proposed by Umoe Mandal, itself a newcomer to 
this sector; previously, the designer / builder had 
specialised in producing high-speed naval corvettes. 
In fact, Umoe Ventus ’ design borrows liberally 
from the ‘surface effect ship’ (SES) concept, one that 
has proven popular in the Norwegian Navy, and 
which has been credited as one of the fastest vessel 
types available; speeds of 60knots and more are not 
uncommon. The SES concept incorporates a 
combination of catamaran hulls and hovercraft 
technology, deploying an air cushion between the 
hulls to lift 80% of the vessel above water. As a result, 
the SES is able to curb wave-induced motions and 
attain higher speeds than the average catamaran 
whilst burning less fuel. 
In addition, when the air cushion is raised, the 
vessel can realise a minimum draught of 
approximately 0.7m, thereby enabling her to access 
ports subject to tidal restrictions and shallow waters. 
Reduced wave-induced motions equate to greater 
crew comfort. “Seasickness is almost non-existent,” 
comments Umoe Mandal’s Trygve Halvorsen 
Espeland, development manager for the Wave Craft. 
“Further, the air cushion damps motions when 
accessing turbines, increasing the operational 
window to wave heights of up to 2.5m significant 
wave height.” The Carbon Trust has calculated that 
the Wave Craft design is able to increase wind farm 
accessibility by “at least 20%”. 
Her owner, Umoe Wind (Umoe Mandal’s sister 
company), has handed Umoe Ventus over to DONG 
Energy, which has chartered the vessel to support its 
activities at the 312MW Borkum Riffgrund 1 
offshore wind farm, in the North Sea.

R
obert Allan Ltd (RAL) continued its long-
standing relationship with Turkey’s Sanmar 
Shipyard in 2015, one of the notable deliveries 
being the first of RAL’s new RAscal 1800 class of 
azimuth stern drive (ASD) tug. 
Incorporated directly into Sanmar’s fleet, 
Yeniçay 1 and the RAscal 1800 series builds on 
RAL’s previous RAscal 1500 class, and has been 
described as the ‘big sister’ to that particular 
breed of twin Z-drive tug. Whereas the RAscal 
1500 measured some 14.9m x 8.3m – as featured 
on the vessel Brage, which Sanmar delivered to 
Norwegian owner Bukser og Berging in 2014 – 
the RAscal 1800 features an extended length of 
18.7m loa and 9.2m, with a corresponding 
increase in vessel depth. 
Yeniçay 1’s propulsive set-up comprises:  two 
Caterpillar C32 diesels, each rated 970kW at 
1,800rpm; a pair of Veth VZ-900 fixed pitch 
Z-drive units; and five-bladed, nozzled, 
1,700mm-diameter propellers. This set-up grants 
the tug a bollard pull of 31tonnes and a free 
running speed of 12knots. Designed for a  four-
man crew, Yeniçay 1 features two below-deck 
double cabins, a galley, a mess and toilet/shower 
facilities. By incorporating resiliently mounted 
engines, visco-elastic floor technology and 
composite shafting into her design, onboard 
noise levels have been restricted to 63dbA in the 
wheelhouse and 60dbA in the galley area and 
cabins. 
The vessel’s primary tasks include ship-assist 
work, line-handling, inland coastal towing and 
general harbour duties. Additionally, she has also 
been equipped for firefighting operations. In 
addition to her spacious fuel and water tanks, the 
tug can store up to 1,618litres of foam, and the 
vessel has been fitted with a fi-fi pump, courtesy 
of Fire Fighting Systems (FFS), with a capacity of 
600m³ per hour. 
The bow and stern are equipped with stainless 
steel fairleads, to accommodate a towline during 
her ship-assist operations, and the bow also 
features a DMT TW ship assist hawser winch, 
which is rated 0-30m/minute at 3tonnes. The 
hawser drum contains 100m worth of 40mm 
nylon rope, arranged in four layers, with a brake 
capacity of 75tonnes. RAL explains: “The hawser 
winch forward is used for normal ship-handling 
arrangements but the towline can also be passed 
aft through a tunnel beneath the wheelhouse, and 
then through a towing portal on the aft deck, for 
aft towing operations.” A 30tonne SWL towing 
hook is positioned aft, for ship-handling tows. 
Bigger may be yet to come; Sanmar is reportedly 
working on a ‘super-powered’ version of the 
RAscal 1800, which would replace the 1800’s C32 
engines with Caterpillar 3512 units, which would 
boost the bollard pull to 40tonnes.
