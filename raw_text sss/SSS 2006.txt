A 
new Trinity House rapid intervention vessel, 
named Alert, was built by Remontowa at Gdansk, 
in Poland. The vessel has now been deployed to cover 
the south-east corner of the country, primarily the 
Dover Strait, where she will be able to respond rapidly 
to any maritime incident. Alert will help to ensure 
Trinity House continues to provide an efficient service 
for mariners entering the ports and navigating the 
seaways under its jurisdiction.
Alert represents the completion of the first stage of 
an investment of £38 million on three new vessels by 
the General Lighthouse Authorities (GLAs) of the 
United Kingdom and Ireland.  
The vessel has been classed by Lloyd’s Register to 100 
A1 SSC Workboat G4; Lloyd’s Machinery certificate; 
Unmanned Machinery Space certificate; Machinery 
Condition Maintenance, Lloyd’s Environmental Policy, 
Lifting Appliance and Dynamic Positioning to CM 
Standard. The vessel also complies with requirements 
for UK MCA Class V111 vessels.
The 39.3m vessel has been installed with two 
Caterpillar diesel engines which each have an output of 
1492kW at 1600rev/min. In addition, two 50 XF5/4 
Kamewa variable pitch propellers, and one HRP bow 
thruster that has an output of 155kW at 1620rev/min 
were fitted on Alert.
The vessel can undertake hydrographic surveys, 
including bathymetry, side scan, sonar and wreck 
investigations, and sampling projects. Alert can also be 
utilised as a research platform with her large working 
deck that can be used for deployment of scientific 
equipment and sampling work. 
She also has capabilities for marine hazard 
search and marking; lifting, towing, and accurate 
positioning of  marine equipment; recovery and 
re-establishment of  off-station aids to navigation; 
sea trials of  electronic and specialty equipment 
helicopter support; safety boat assignments; and 
guard duties for cable and pipe laying projects. 
Alert is fitted with a range of high specification survey 
equipment and to the highest and most modern 
technical standards. With DP1 dynamic positioning, the 
vessel has a service speed of 15knots and a maximum 
speed of 17knots.
Alert has been equipped with a complete suite of 
navigation and communication equipment supplied by 
Northrop Grumman Corp’s Sperry Marine business 
unit. The system includes radars, electronic chart display 
and information system, autopilot, dual-axis speed log, 
dual fiber-optic gyros, magnetic compass, echosounder, 
automatic identification system, differential GPS, 
and voyage data recorder. Due to the confined space 
available on the bridge, a number of the displays have 
multifunction capability. The system runs on Sperry 
Marine’s proprietary Voyage Management System 
software. The communication equipment includes 
satellite and radio systems meeting the Global Maritime 
Distress and Safety System carriage requirements, as 
well as an Iridium satellite terminal.

T
he new pilot boat Arrow, a Camarc-designed 
16m vessel, was delivered to Falmouth Harbour 
Commissioners in November. It was one of two 
vessels ordered by the harbour commissioners and PD 
Ports in Teesport. Arrow entered service at the start of 
December. 
The VT Halmatic 16M design is based on Teesport’s 
existing 16m pilot boat Coatham. Following PD Ports’ 
six years experience of successfully operating this type 
of vessel, the operators had extensive input into the 
improvements and enhancements to the original design 
and specification.
The vessel has a length overall of 19.95m, a length 
waterline of 15.40m, a beam overall of 4.64m, and a fully 
loaded draught of 1.35m.  The vessel has been classed by 
Lloyd’s Register to +100A1 SSC Mono Pilot HSC G3 and 
also complies with UK MCA ‘Code of Practice for the 
Safety of Small Workboats & Pilot Boats’, and is certified 
as a workboat with up to 12 passengers, and a pilot boat 
endorsement for Sea Area Cat2 (up to 60nm from safe 
haven).
Arrow has been equipped with two Scania DI 16M EMS 
diesel engines rated at 570mph, and can reach a service 
speed of 21knots and a maximum speed of 23knots fully 
loaded.  Two Twin Disc gearboxes have also been fitted. 
A five bladed FP nickel aluminium bronze propeller, 
from CJR propulsion, has a speed of 1029rev/min.
As is expected, a comprehensive set of bridge 
electronics have been fitted. This includes a Furuno 
NavNet radar; radio telephones from Sailor, and GPS 
from CSI Vector and Furuno. A Marinex 2-zone fire 
detection system has been fitted with smoke detectors, 
along with a Pyrogen fire smothering system.
Arrow has crew of three and there is capacity of up 
to 12 passengers.  A mess has been provided for six, 
along with a galley, and one WC.

T
he first two Damen Axe Bow vessels were delivered 
to Oceanteam in September 2006 and the vessels 
were then leased by Diavaz for operation in deep water 
in the Gulf of Mexico. The concept of the Axe Bow 
vessels is an advancement of the 1999 enlarged ship 
concept that was jointly researched by Damen and 
Delft University. 
The vessel's axe-shaped bow maximises the waterline 
length and prevents the bow from coming out of the 
water; it decreases the bow flare and increases the 
draught of the bow significantly; it has strikingly low 
vertical acceleration levels; there is complete absence 
of bow slamming as well as decreased resistance; thus 
downtime and fuel consumption is reduced.
The vessels have a length overall of 33.57m, a beam 
overall of 7.36m, a depth of 3.30m, and an aft draught 
of 1.95m. The ships can reach a maximum speed of 
26knots. Axebow 1 and Axebow 2 have been classified by 
Bureau Veritas to 1 + Hull; MACH.
Three Caterpillar C32 B engines have been fitted, and 
these have an output of 3300bhp at 2100rev/min each. 
In addition, there are three Reintjes WVS430 gearboxes, 
and three FP propellers fitted. A hydraulic bow thruster 
in each vessel produces 75kW of power.
The ships have been installed with a full and 
comprehensive set of  bridge electronics including 
a JRC radar; and Raytheon Anschutz autopilot; and 
Seiwa/Explorer GPS and plotter; VHF and HM/MF 
from Sailor; and AIS from JRC.
Lifesaving equipment for the 75 passengers and crew 
includes lifebuoys, life jackets; and four Viking 20-
person life rafts; as well as a Novec fixed gas flooding 
system in the engineroom.

ergen Star is a 4440dwt oil product tanker. It 
is the first ship to be built to an innovative 
concept developed by NVC-Design in Rolls-Royce, 
combining a tailor-made hull design with a diesel 
mechanical propulsion system based on twin Azipull 
azimuth thrusters with pulling propellers.
Norwegian-owner Haugland Tankers had the tanker 
built by RMK shipyard in Turkey. Bergen Star is on long 
term charter to Statoil, and Bergen Tankers operate 
it primarily along the Norwegian coast.  Many ports 
here are difficult to access, and good manoeuvring 
characteristics had high priority.
The NVC-Design concept using Azipull propulsion 
covers a range of product tankers for coastal waters 
and worldwide trading from 3000dwt-30,000dwt, 
the upper limit depending on the required speed 
and ice class.  Bergen Star builds on the concept, but 
is a design tailored to this experienced shipowner’s 
precise requirements, and given the type name NVC 
604 PT.
Among the many advantages of the concept is an 
increase in cargo space compared to a conventional 
single screw product tanker, since the azimuth 
thruster system allows the engine room bulkhead 
to be moved further aft. Depending on the size 
of vessel, the increase in cargo volume is 5%-7%. 
This provides a short payback time on the slightly 
increased construction cost compared with a basic 
single screw ship. 
By using two independent propulsion lines 
comprising thruster, shaft generator, and main 
engine and control system, a high level of redundancy 
is achieved. It also means that maintenance work 
can be carried out on one engine when the vessel is 
working cargo in port, since the other unit, assisted 
by the tunnel bow thruster, is immediately available 
to take the vessel to safety should an emergency arise 
at the terminal. Maintenance can also be carried out 
at sea on reduced speed and Bergen Star can operate 
economically at  low speed on one engine. Propulsion 
system redundancy also increases the level of safety in 
coastal navigation.
In developing the hull form, Rolls-Royce had to 
ensure that the ship would have good course-keeping 
ability. Hulls with length to beam ratios desirable for 
low first cost and high earning capacity in the past 
tended to have poor course stability when propelled by 
azimuth thrusters, needing large steering corrections 
resulting in heavier fuel consumption.
Choice of Azipulls for propulsion helps greatly, as 
these thrusters with their hydrodynamically optimised 
underwater units provide substantial rudder area. 
Even so, a major programme of computational design 
and model testing of the hull was undertaken to ensure 
that the result would be a tanker with course stability 
well in excess of the IMO zig-zag test requirements.
The hull is double, meeting the new regulations, 
and incorporates a bulbous bow, plus a short skeg for 
docking purposes. Azipull propulsors are positioned 
below headboxes and allow the aft end of the hull to 
be optimised for minimum resistance and simplified 
hull construction.
Each independent propulsion system comprises a 
main engine driving an Azipull thruster equipped 
with a CP propeller, with a generator interposed in 
the shaft between engine and thruster. The simple 
mechanical layout offers flexibility and efficiency. 
Transmission losses are much lower than a diesel 
electric drive and the system is less demanding to 
operate.
An attraction is that in port one engine can be shut 
down. The other is declutched from its thruster and 
drives its generator supplying power for the hydraulic 
deepwell cargo pump powerpacks and the vessel’s 
hotel load.
Haugland Tankers’ new vessel has a cargo hold 
volume of 5175m3 split between 10 tanks. Cargo 
heating is by stainless steel coils through which 
thermal oil is circulated. Each tank has its own cargo 
pump and the total discharge rate is 1200m3/hr.

ourbon Orca the new Ulstein AX104 design is 
an anchor handling tug supply vessel (AHTS), 
and was a result of collaboration between Bourbon 
Offshore, ship designer Ulstein Design, and ODIM, 
which specialises in marine automated systems. The 
vessel now works under contract for Norsk Hydro.
In contrast to most existing vessels, on which the 
bridge projects above the level of the sea, Bourbon Orca 
differs with an inverted bow design. The first thing 
noticeable about an Ulstein AX104 vessel is the new 
hull shape. The bow is the reverse of a conventional 
bow, leaning backwards instead of forwards: an 
Ulstein X-BOW. Model tests have shown this vessel 
can sail faster and consume less fuel in high waves 
than a conventional bow would allow.
Vessels with an Ulstein X-BOW cleave the waves, 
reducing noise and vibration. The hull shape provides 
major buoyancy and reduces slamming against the 
vessel. There is also little sea spray on deck. These 
properties are important contributions toward greater 
work safety in rough seas. A vessel with an Ulstein 
X-BOW will also have greater fuel economy and can 
sail at higher speeds in poor weather conditions than 
vessels with a conventional bow.
The design collaboration produced the SAHS system 
(safe anchor handling system) which eliminates any 
human presence on the after deck of the vessel during 
the most dangerous operations to ensure optimum 
protection of the crews.  The vessel was tested in 
conditions corresponding to those in the North Sea. 
This shows that the ship will in most cases be able to 
perform very demanding tasks regardless of weather 
conditions and speed. The greatest significant wave 
height in the model tests in Trondheim was 6m. 
That corresponds to a wave height of 11m in real 
conditions. 
When the vessel is in a dynamic position, the 
shape of the bottom limits the effects of eddies and 
banging. As a result, Bourbon Orca can operate under 
very difficult sea conditions, particularly in the North 
Sea. In addition, this design offers better working and 
safety conditions for crews, who will enjoy greater 
comfort, both in terms of sound levels, vibration, and 
stability.
The rear deck is equipped with two powerful 
mobile cranes equipped with articulated grappling 
hooks, a control system and a remote activated 
video surveillance system, as well as a mobile anchor 
handling platform system to replace the traditional 
stern roller.
For environmental reasons, Bourbon Orca was 
equipped with diesel-electric propulsion. This 
vessel will be the first AHTS to be equipped with 
this solution, combined with azimuth thrusters. 
This technology, combined with the hull design, 
significantly reduces gas and toxic emissions and 
ensures significant fuel savings. While with a 
conventional propulsion system, the engines of an 
AHTS run continuously, with this type of propulsion, 
only the energy needed is consumed, generating both 
economic and environmental benefits.

A 
new tug, a UNV 135 AT, called Cap Sigli, an 
azimuthing tractor tug of 35tonnes bollard pull, 
was delivered by UNV, of Spain, early in 2006. The tug 
was delivered to the Algerian port authority of Béjaïa 
and is the first azimuthing tractor to be used in Algeria. 
The dock and sea trials of Cap Sigli were carried out in 
November 2005 and the delivery took place in Béjaïa, in 
December of the same year.
The tug is 29.5m in length, has a 28.0m beam, a gross 
tonnage of 369gt, and has been designed for use in 
harbour, coastal, and sea going operations, and is also 
equipped for fire fighting, and has been fitted with anti-
pollution devices.
Cap Sigli was designed by the UNV technical office 
to comply with Bureau Veritas class notation I + Hull 
+Mach Remorqueur Haute Mer +AUT-MS, Firefighting 
(FiFi1) + Clean Sea + Clean Air.  The owner’s inspection 
was carried out by the consultant Erenav, from Algiers. 
The vessel also complies with the following regulations: 
Freeboard 1966; Gross Tonnage 1969; Marpol 74/78; 
Colreg 1972; and in general with all IMO rules applicable 
to this type of vessel. 
Accommodation has been provided for eight in three 
double cabins with bunk beds and two single cabins for 
the officers. There is a mess room onboard equipped 
for the crew and one stainless steel galley with kitchen, 
and one common sanitary room. The accommodation is 
fully air conditioned by a unit installed in a store below 
the wheelhouse. The wheelhouse located is above the 
accommodation superstructure.
Two four stroke diesel engines MAK 6M20 developing 
1140kW at 1000rev/min with its auxiliary equipment: 
starting air bottles, diesel pump and filters, turbo-
compressor, refrigeration pumps, oil cooler, lubrication 
oil pump and filters, 35dB silencer, and spares and tools. 
The engines have been prepared to burn gas oil and have 
been designed to drive Rolls-Royce model US 155 FP 
propellers in a tractor configuration.

T
HE Genesis 37 Interceptor is a new model from 
shipyard Safehaven Marine. It is a completely new 
design and is a replacement for the old Interceptor 38 
model.  This Genesis model, called Celtic Amara, is 
closely based on the company’s successful Interceptor 
42’s hull, but incorporating a number of refinements 
to provide even higher levels of performance and 
seakeeping. 
Her beam is a wide 3.81m just 254mm short of 
the 42’s beam, and much wider than the 38 model, 
providing her with high levels of both static and 
dynamic stability. With a GM of 1.5m she has 
high reserves of stability over an anticipated large 
displacement range, as indeed she will form the basis 
for a new 11.27m pilot boat to be offered alongside 
the current Interceptor 42 pilot boat. 
Celtic Amara’s waterline entry has been made finer 
at 50degs to cut through waves, and she has the same 
midship deadrise of 22degs meaning she will not slam 
in large waves. The vessel’s steeply raked stem and 
cutaway forefoot means she has the same handling in 
following seas. 
Her keel design has been optimised to provide the 
least drag and resistance with maximum directional 
stability. Because the Interceptor hull is a true deep V 
she has a deep draught at the bow and amidships, so 
there is no need for a deep keel, as her deep V sections 
act as a keel in itself. Only at the transom where her 
draught reduces is the keel needed and here it is 
deep, its hydrodynamics are optimised with the keel 
being integrally faired into the propeller tunnel, to 
provide a smooth, clean flow of water to the propeller 
completely eliminating cavitation. In addition a 
stainless steel skeg protects the prop and rudder from 
ropes and floating debris.
This will provide a higher speed and better fuel 
economy, an important consideration with today’s 
rising fuel costs. Her unique double chine hull design 
and multiple spray rails, foreshortened at the bow 
which combined with her high rise of chine at the 
bow, eliminates chine knock making her a dry boat.
The craft’s superstructure has been offset to port to 
allow a good wide and safe passage up the starboard 
side to the fore deck, so as not to waste valuable 
accommodation by providing a walkway up the port 
side that never gets used. 
The design takes advantage of her wide beam in 
providing maximum gunwale space for angling, 
allowing anglers to fish from the full length of the 
craft when drifting. In addition she features a large 
aft deck area with a flush deck which provides 
plenty of space, but still allows for a comfortable 
accommodation area. 
Both long and short cabin versions are available. 
The extended cabin version of the craft provides 
increased accommodation area and greater luxury to 
her internal fit out. 
Powered by a Caterpillar C9 575hp engine, the 
vessel can achieve a maximum speed of 27knots on 
her heavily built 7500kg displacement with excellent 
fuel economy at 16knots-18knots.  A Lloyd’s Register-
approved scantling and framing has been used in this 
pilot boat.
The vessel reportedly has good abilities in big head 
seas, even after being completely air borne, to the 
point of showing her propeller when coming off the 
crest of a big wave, the landings were always soft and 
controlled. In following seas her wide beam resisted 
roll and yaw in quartering conditions making her very 
safe and controllable in surfing conditions with zero 
broaching tendencies.

T
raditional designs of patrol and safety/rescue craft, 
whether of semi-displacement or planing hull 
form (including rigid inflatable boats) create substantial 
wash, especially in shallow water, when required to 
move at high speed, for example when responding to 
an emergency.  Furthermore, the large wash created 
at speed can be damaging to the riverbank/shore 
environment and the high resistance created by the 
wash causes high fuel consumption, with subsequent 
depletion of fuel resources and unnecessarily high 
atmospheric emissions.  
The Port of  London Authority’s (PLA) marine 
engineer and harbour master recognised the importance 
of providing river patrols that caused the least wash 
at the range of typical patrol and emergency speeds 
and initiated a programme of  research, trials and 
vessel development, aimed at achieving operational 
commitments with substantially reduced wash and 
fuel-burn. Following a scientific study of  wash 
characteristics of different hull forms operating at high 
speed in shallow river conditions, undertaken for the 
PLA by Southampton University, was the subsequent 
design and build of two new patrol launches for the 
PLA’s Upper District, by Ecocats Ltd.  
The results exceed expectations, both in terms of low 
wash in the shallow water of the PLA’s Upper District 
and in fuel economy/emissions.  Wash is reduced from 
1.0m to 0.25m, at emergency response speed, and the 
design’s low hydrodynamic resistance produces fuel-
burn and emissions savings typically of 67%, when 
compared with the semi-displacement monohull vessels 
previously used for operational patrols.
The Ecocat E31 patrol vessel, Chelsea, relies upon fine-
lined semi-displacement catamaran hulls, to deliver the 
optimised wash, resistance and buoyancy characteristics 
that were predicted by the research and trials programme. 
Through use of advanced composites for hull and 
structure and tight control of production processes 
and equipment weights, the vessel’s displacement has 
been kept to the design standard, drawn from ISO 
12215-5 and sufficient to exceed the MCA’s SCV Code 
requirements for unrestricted operations at sea or in 
categorised waters.  
The catamaran platform and spacious island 
wheelhouse ensure large open working decks with 
good access within the vessel and to other river users. 
While constraints upon the PLA resulted in the choice 
of diesel outboard propulsion, alternative outboard or 
inboard arrangements are possible to give increased 
vessel speed, should that be required.
This research, development and design project has 
added substantially to the potential for improved safety 
in inland waterway and inshore patrol and rescue 
craft, while also providing benefits to the riverbank, 
atmospheric and water environments.  The initiative 
establishes a new level of small ship construction 
and environmental best practice, now available to the 
benefit of other UK and overseas port, inland/inshore 
waters, navigational and rescue authorities, and the 
general public which they serve.
Chelsea has a length of 10.65m overall, a length bp 
of 9.07m, a moulded depth of 1.95m and a moulded 
breadth of  3.75m. With a design deadweight of 
3.8tonnes, and a lightweight of 3.85tonnes, the vessel 
also has a displacement of 3.9tonnes.  Chelsea did not 
need classification, but she meets ISO standards, and 
has been certified to the UK MCA for operation in sea 
area category 3.
The craft has been installed with two Yanmar D36 
diesel outboard motors which have an output of 27kW 
at 4500rev/min.  Two aluminium Yanmar FP propellers 
also assist propulsion and the vessel has a maximum 
speed of 18knots, a service speed of 16knots, and a 
patrol speed of 8knots.  Interestingly, four 60W solar 
panels have been fitted to Chelsea to ensure the battery 
is topped-up.

I
n response to increased poaching and the depletion 
of fish stocks The Marine and Coastal Management 
(MCM) division of the Department of Environmental 
Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) requested South African 
boat builders to develop a high speed vessel capable 
of overtaking and apprehending organised gangs of 
armed poachers.
 World demand and high prices for abalone is fueling 
indiscriminate poaching and South Africa’s once 
plentiful stocks are now facing collapse.  The criminals 
were mostly able to evade capture by simply out 
running the authorities in their rigid inflatable boats 
with twin outboard motors capable of speeds up to 
55knots.  
The speed requirement was paramount, the vessel 
had to be able to reach 65knots, operate in offshore 
conditions, whilst carrying a crew of  eight armed 
men and fuel sufficient for a range of 400km. MCM 
particularly wanted the boat to be built in aluminium for 
its longevity and durability in harsh African conditions.
Eraco Boat Builders took up the challenge and 
set about designing a suitable monohull capable of 
sustaining high speeds on the often-turbulent South 
African waters.  Armed with an early design Eraco 
contracted CAE Marine in Stellenbosch as consultants 
to assist with further developments. Dr Brian Gowans 
of Marine Technology Cape Town was contracted as 
an independent to superintend the design and build to 
MCA standards and to conduct proving trials.
To contend with constant pounding from waves over 
1m at speeds in excess of 60knots the hull had to be 
able to withstand slamming forces up to 13G.  CAE 
structural engineers designed an immensely strong and 
rigid labyrinth of transverse frames and angle section 
longitudinal stiffeners welded into 6mm hull plates. 
The structure was designed to DNV High Speed 
Light Craft code.  Weight is a critical factor influencing 
performance and every effort was made to reduce it. 
The entire 13.6m hull, excluding propulsion system, 
weighs only 2350kg.  
Equipment vital to the ability of the pilot and crew 
to function in comfort and safety included the state of 
the art shock absorbing seats from Ullman Dynamics 
in Sweden, suspended on a carbon fibre tension spring 
reduces bone jarring impact from 13G down to under 
2G, providing a comfortable ride.
The vessel has been equipped with two Seatek 820 
plus main engines each with an output of 611kW, and 
two ZF gearboxes with an output speed of 2540rev/
min. Two FP stainless steel Rolla propellers were also 
fitted, which were adapted with five-blade surface 
piercing capabilities.

F
S Camille, built by Yardimci Shipyard for 
Fouquet Sacop Maritime, of France, is a single 
decked ship with double bottom and double sides, 
specially designed for bunkering and ship-to-ship 
transfer operations. Designed by the Istanbul-based 
consultancy, Delta Marine, the vessel is able to carry 
petroleum products with flash point above 60°C, 
with the specific gravity no more than 1030t/m3 at 
75°C. Another sister of the vessel is being built in the 
same shipyard for Yardimci Gemi Insa AS.
FS Camille has eight cargo tanks in total and one 
slop tank integrated in the cargo area. Six of the cargo 
tanks, dedicated for carriage of HFO, are separated 
from the other two cargo tanks, carrying DO, by 
the slop tank. A pair of cargo tanks are divided by 
a horizontally corrugated longitudinal CL bulkhead, 
while vertically corrugated bulkheads have been used 
for separation in transverse direction. 
No steel structure is facing into the cargo tanks 
except for the deck framing and two web frames on 
the longitudinal bulkhead. The pipe tunnel, located 
between ballast tanks and along the cargo area, 
ensures the ballast valves keep dry. 
The cargo discharge system is based around two 
different types of cargo pumps. Two Bornemann 
electrically-driven, twin screw pumps, with a capacity 
of 400m3/h and located in a separate pump room, 
are dedicated to serve for HFO tanks. Two Marflex, 
electrically-driven, deepwell pumps are able to 
discharge DO with a rate of 80m3/h. The slop tank 
in the middle of HFO and DO tanks is fitted with a 
50m3/h rated, electrically-driven, screw pump.
This specialised tanker has been built with 
two enginerooms, separated with a full A60 steel 
bulkhead, and thus complies with the related 
notation of classification society Det Norske Veritas. 
To increase the environmental protection and vessel 
safety, the fuel tanks in the engineroom are double 
hulled, and the construction of the skeg between 
azimuth thrusters improves the course keeping.
One of the most important features of FS Camille is 
the innovative propulsion system consisting of two 
azimuth thrusters directly driven from two medium-
speed diesel engines. The main engines, each with a 
capacity of 1080kW, are supplied by Wärtsilä, who 
with Lips, also provide the azimuth thrusters, with a 
speed of 352rev/min.
The vessel is fitted with one auxiliary diesel 
generator of 500kW at 1500rev/min and one 
emergency diesel generator with an output of 320kW 
at 1500rev/min. Heating of cargo and domestic 
services is generated by two pieces of thermal oil 
heaters and economisers. 
The hull form of FS Camille, has minimal resistance 
from wave and friction, through extensive powering 
tests carried out in the Bulgarian Ship Hydrodynamics 
Centre, in Varna, and CFD analyses carried out by 
Mesh Engineering Co. Good course keeping is a 
significant feature of the vessel and the fitting of 
azimuth thrusters, and a bow thruster, of 300kW, 
increases the manoeuvring capability.
A cargo handling crane has 22m of outreach, which 
enables the vessel to provide ship-to-ship transfer 
operation. All controls of engine operations and 
main engines start-up are managed from an engine 
console in the wheelhouse. Two freestanding funnels 
at port and starboard sides of the superstructure are 
also fitted.
The accommodation area is located in the aft of the 
ship, and is divided into two decks and a wheelhouse 
deck. The total complement is arranged for 10 people 
- that is three officers and seven crew - and cabins 
with private facilities are provided.

n July, Rodriquez Cantieri Navali do Brasil SpA, 
the Brazilian yard of the Italian Rodriquez Group, 
delivered the first and launched the second of seven 
double ended catamarans under construction for 
Barcas SA, in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.
Gavea I is the fourth vessel to be completed by 
Rodriquez’s Brazilian shipyard after the three 28m 
catamarans delivered in 2005. Entirely built of 
aluminium, with a length of 52m, and a beam of 
14.2m, Gavea I has a notable capacity.
The vessel is able to transport 1300 passengers, 900 
seated, for a total payload of 12tonnes, with a light 
displacement of 290tonnes.  The vessel is double 
ended, composed of two hulls connected by the main 
deck, an upper deck, two command bridges - one on 
each end - and a top deck.
The Citycat 52 DE design is a double-ended vessel 
with a double bridge in order to optimise the time 
spent at the quayside and two MTU 16V 2000 M70 
engines rated at 1050kW each, placed between the two 
hulls on the boat’s longitudinal axis, each coupled to 
an azimuth propeller wholly designed by Rodriquez 
Marine System.
This system allows the vessel to reach a service 
speed of 18knots, which is more than sufficient to 
reduce the time needed to cover the route from the 
present 25 minutes to just 12 minutes, with a fuel 
consumption of only 250litres/hour for each engine. 
This is also due to the rapidity of disembarkation and 
embarkation.
Gavea I is now used on one of the busiest ferry 
services in the world: she links Rio de Janeiro to 
the residential and industrial city of Niterói, a route 
used by over 80,000 passengers every day, mainly 
commuters travelling to and from their workplaces.
Rodriquez Cantieri Navali do Brasil was founded 
in Rio de Janeiro by Rodriquez Cantieri Navali after 
the signing of a contract for the construction of 10 
aluminium catamarans with Barcas SA. This contract 
stipulated that the construction be in Brasil and hence 
this new yard was established in Niteroi and opened 
in August 2003. There are 10 catamarans under 
construction, three CityCat 29s (29m length overall, 
25knots, and 230 passengers) and seven CityCat 
52DEs as described above.

leann Mor the first of class Interceptor ‘Pilot 42’ 
was launched in April 2006. This vessel was 
based on the successful Interceptor 42 hull, which 
has seen service as class 6 passenger boats, work 
boats, dive boats, and patrol boats, with over 20 craft 
now in operation throughout the UK, and Europe. 
The hull design is well proven and renowned for 
possessing excellent sea keeping abilities.  Gleann Mor 
has a length overall of 13.10m, beam 4.27m, and a 
draught of 1.37m.
In summer 2005 the contract was awarded to 
Safehaven Marine to build the new pilot boat for the 
Port of Cork. One of the main requirements for the 
Port was for exceptional strength. To achieve this, 
substantial 150mm x 150mm transverse frames at 
500mm centres on a 10,000gm2 shell laminate were 
used. The same substantial beams were used on the 
deck structure and knees, which provides strength at 
the critical deck to hull join.
The net result is that the likelihood of damage 
occurring to her hull as a result of normal pilot 
boarding operations is substantially reduced, meaning 
less down time, an important consideration for a busy 
port like Cork Harbour. Her main fendering was 
provided by Technix Rubber, consisting of 160mm 
heavy D section, with 140mm D section used for the 
lower belting and the diagonals. This combination 
provides good protection to the craft when alongside 
ships. On deck, a wide walkway, 32mm railings, and 
Hadrian safety rail facilitate safe passage.
In the cabin, the arrangement chosen by the Port 
of Cork, was for a central helm position. This means 
boarding can take place to the side best suited to the 
prevailing conditions, as both port and starboard 
side benefit from equal visibility. In addition the 
helmsman’s seating and steering position has been 
designed with car like ergonomics in mind, allowing 
fatigue free operation, where all controls fall easily 
to hand. 
Visibility is maximised by the use of forward 
slopping front windows, to easily shed water and 
reduce glare and reflections. Upper level skylights 
and roof windows give a clear view overhead. Front 
screens are heated and in addition a hot air heater/
demister is fitted to ensure good visibility at all 
times. 
Gleann Mor is powered by a pair of Volvo D12 
engines rated at 450hp at 1800rev/min continuous. 
This provides her with a required operational speed of 
23knots on a 18,000kg displacement, being cognisant 
of fuel costs and efficiency. 
Another part of the Port of Cork specification was 
to provide a means of quick engine replacement in the 
event of a failure. To this end a large hatch was built 
into the superstructure roof which can be quickly 
removed, the four pilot seats can then be unbolted 
and the completed seating modules removed. A 
large hatch situated in the cabin sole is unlatched 
and hinged back, allowing the engines to be quickly 
removed. 
During sea trials, seakeeping was tested in severe 
weather conditions, storm force 10, 60knots of wind, 
and 10m seas with wind against tide at the entrance 
to Cork Harbour. Punching into steep head seas her 
behaviour was reportedly excellent. Her deep V hull, 
weight and strength allowed her to punch through the 
waves almost silently with no bangs or slams and even 
after being airborne her landings were very soft, after 
shouldering the seas aside. 
The aft central con position and pilot seating 
resulted in very low motions for the crew, providing 
comfort even in these conditions. Her beam ensures 
there is very little rolling and heel and it can withstand 
heavy breaking seas striking her. 
It’s worthwhile to note also that the screens 
remained virtually dry throughout the test, her twin 
chine hull design effectively suppressing airborne 
spray allowing good visibility to be maintained, 
even in poor conditions. Turning to run before the 
seas Gleann Mor was controllable, allowing hands off 
steering in following seas, running straight down 
wind displaying exceptional directional stability. 
Putting the seas on the transom quarter, always a 
test for a boat, she was again very steady, with little 
heeling on the face of waves when surfing and zero 
tendency to yaw. In fact her stiffness and stability on 
this course was very impressive.  
During ship-boarding trials her ability to easily 
come away from a ship provided great confidence 
to the coxswain and crew; her deep V hull design 
creating a large wedge of water between the two hulls, 
pushing her off easily by use of the wheel alone. She 
was also very dry and stable when alongside.

old Express and Silver Express were built for the 
Caribbean company L'Express des Iles at Austal 
Shipyard’s Fremantle facility. L'Express des Iles 
ferries operate regular domestic and international 
services between the harbours of Guadeloupe, 
Marie-Galante, Le Saintes, Dominica, Martinique, 
and Sainte-Lucia.
During 2002 the design and performance criteria 
of the two ferries were established with much of 2003 
and 2004 focused on achieving a flexible finance 
solution before a contract was signed. A year, to the 
day, later both boats were handed over prior to them 
being loaded onboard a heavy lift ship in Fremantle 
Harbour bound for Guadeloupe.
With the boats entering service at the end of 2005 
the entire four-boat L'Express des Iles fleet, following 
some recent sales, is now comprised entirely of Austal 
built fast ferries.  Continuing the design theme of the 
current Austal boats in operation, Silver Express carries 
360 passengers and 10 cars, and Gold Express 446 
passengers, however, they share the same length and 
have identical four engine propulsion arrangements 
providing a speed of 38knots fully loaded.
The ships have a round bilge, bulbous bow hull 
form, and propulsion is via four MTU 16V 396 TE74L 
main engines (this keeps commonality with L'Express 
des Iles’ existing fleet); four ZF 7550 gearboxes; 
and four Kamewa 63 S11 waterjets.  They have also 
been equipped with Seastate Ride Control System 
(Interceptors and T-Foils) and an Austal Marinelink 
Vessel Monitoring System.
The upper deck area of the ships has an open design, 
with sliding windows and large aft doors.  In each 
ship there is a passenger GPS system, LCD television, 
and passenger access to two vending machines, and 
a kiosk, which has a display and an under-counter 
fridge. There is also a first aid room on each ship and 
a children’s area with a dedicated DVD player. Crew 
mess and crew berths have been provided for four 
persons.
Gold Express has cargo storage for 10 crates with 
custom built cranes, and Silver Express has cargo and 
car storage for 10 cars and 10 crates with side ramp. 
There is a high ceiling height of 2.2m, where as a 
typical ceiling height is usually 2m or less.
A workshop can be found aft on the main deck 
with mooring capstans forward and aft. The ships 
have self-cleaning sea chests, and are equipped with 
Zodiac 150/100 person liferaft systems. As expected, 
Gold Express and Silver Express are fitted with a full 
complement of HSC electronics, including VDR, 
DVR, AIS, DSAS, GMDSS A3, and night vision.

H
MS Clyde, the first ship to be built in 
Portsmouth Naval Base for nearly 40 years, 
was delivered in October 2006. The catalyst for 
this renewal in shipbuilding was the move, in 2003, 
of VT Shipbuilding to £50 million state-of-the-art 
facilities.
The UK Royal Navy’s new 80m offshore patrol 
vessel (helicopter) (OPV(H)) will be the new patrol 
ship for the Falkland Islands and will deployed to the 
south Atlantic in spring 2007.
One of the unique features of the ship is that she 
is owned by VT Group and chartered to the UK 
Ministry of Defence for a period of five years. At the 
end of that period, the MoD can either extend the 
charter, return the ship or purchase her outright. 
Among the ship’s enhanced features compared 
to the older River class is a flight deck capable of 
accepting helicopters up to the size of the new Merlin 
aircraft. Other enhancements include increased 
accommodation to cater for an embarked force, 
a 30mm gun, higher levels of survivability, and air 
surveillance radar.
The vessel has been installed with two Rushton 
Marine Diesels which have an output of 4125kW 
at 1000rev/min. Two bow thrusters have also been 
fitted.
HMS Clyde will accommodate a crew of 36 (six 
officers, nine senior rates, and 21 junior rates), 
berthed in single or twin berth cabins with en suite 
facilities. There will be additional accommodation for 
up to 20 extra personnel, which could be an embarked 
military force, trainees or headquarters staff.

T
he new owner of James Cook, the Natural 
Environment Research Council (NERC), has 
chartered the vessel to the Research Ship Unit (RSU), 
from the National Oceanography Centre. This vessel 
provides a platform on and from which scientific 
experiments, investigations, and remote equipment 
servicing can be carried out.  The main users of the 
ship will be UK universities and research institutions, 
but some specialist commercial charters may also be 
carried out. 
James Cook is capable of operating safely and 
effectively on an unrestricted worldwide basis 
from high latitude ice margins to equatorial regions 
including the highest air/water temperature regions. 
The vessel will also be required to work on the 
UK/Continent continental shelf working close 
inshore on scientific tasks, wreck investigations, and 
in designated special sea areas where time on such 
locations could extend to 20 days.
The craft has been constructed to Lloyd’s Register 
Ice Class 1C with enhancements such as double 
framing throughout its length and an NERC required 
minimum shell plate thickness of 12mm up to upper 
deck level.
James Cook is able to operate from a wide range of 
ports – both requiring no special port facilities and a 
capability to gain access to small ports – thus allowing 
NERC as large a choice as possible of ‘nearest’ ports 
to reduce the distance from the site at which the 
science will be carried out. 
Most scientific work will be carried out at the aft 
end and along the starboard side. The port side of the 
ship is reserved primarily for ship type operations 
such as rescue boat handling, but it is also used for 
towed echo sounder deployment.  
The ship has a large open aft working deck 
connected to a relatively wide (4m) starboard side 
working deck leading forward to about midships. 
These working decks are about 4m above the 
normal operating draught to minimise the dangers 
of pendulum action when deploying or retrieving 
equipment, while protecting personnel as far as 
possible from the shipment of seas.
Immediately adjacent to the working decks there 
is an enclosed space which provides a protected 
working environment where large and small pieces 
of equipment can be stored, opened up, and worked 
upon. This is a wet space not included within the 
enclosed superstructure. The space will be fitted with 
a gantry crane beam allowing equipment transfer 
from the outside deck. The deck within the wet space 
is sheathed with timber to reduce noise in spaces 
below and to provide protection for the equipment 
being handled.
There are a number of laboratories onboard 
including the deck lab, the water sampling lab, and 
the dry and clean lab.  The ship has accommodation 
and facilities for 54 persons, that is, 32 scientists and 
22 officers and crew.
The vessel has been installed with Wärtsilä 9L20 
main engines which have an output of 1770kW at 
1000rev/min.  Also fitted is a five-bladed Wärtsilä FP 
propeller with a speed of 180rev/min.

A 
multi purpose utility vessel, named Mermaid 
Investigator, which was delivered to Mermaid 
Marine Australia Ltd, was constructed by the Cheoy 
Lee shipyard in Kowloon, and was one of the largest 
vessels ever built at the Hong Kong facility.
The 54m vessel, of all steel construction, now 
operates in the Australian offshore oil and gas 
industry to provide a stable work platform for air/
nitrox dive operations. It also operates as an ROV 
vessel for platform/pipe line maintenance, and as a 
stern landing vessel for the transport of large items of 
cargo direct to shore. 
Furthermore, to increase its versatility, the vessel 
is capable of shallow draught operations, as it has a 
draught of only 2.5m.  Mermaid Investigator was built to 
Bureau Veritas class, for unrestricted navigation.
Two Caterpillar 3512B engines, each developing 
1810hp and driving two Berg CP propellers via Reintjes 
gearboxes, give the vessel a speed of 12knots. Precise 
manoeuvring and positioning is facilitated by Rolls-
Royce bow and stern thrusters (450kW and 300kW 
respectively), and a four point (two bow and two stern), 
anchoring system utilising Plimsoll deck machinery. 
Electrical power comes from a variety of sources. 
One primary, two secondary, and an emergency 
Caterpillar diesel generators, as well as two 600kW 
Leroy Somer shaft driven generators.

A 
new 98m wave piercing catamaran was delivered 
by Incat, of Australia, to one of Spain’s largest 
shipping companies, Acciona Trasmediterránea. 
Milenium Tres is the sixth Incat high speed catamaran 
to join the Acciona Trasmediterránea fleet.  Milenium 
Tres entered service on the Melilla to Almeria and 
Malaga link.
A new feature introduced onboard Milenium Tres, 
making her different from her sisters, is the fully-
enclosed port and starboard side aft staircases leading 
car passengers from the vehicle deck direct to the 
vessel’s aft cabin. On previous 98m vessels these 
staircases have been external to the accommodation.  
Engines from MAN B&W’s new RK280 range, 
powerful and fuel efficient 1000rev/min diesel 
engines, were selected for Milenium Tres. Four 
16RK280 engines, each rated at a minimum 7200kW 
at 1000rev/min MCR, offer a high power to weight 
ratio. The latest combustion chamber technology 
with electronically controlled pump pipe injection 
system and optimised cylinder pressures, reduces fuel 
consumption to a most competitive level offering a 
low operating cost with a specific fuel consumption 
of less than 190g/kWh. Maximum speed is 48knots.
The engines each drive transom-mounted steerable 
Wärtsilä-Lips 120E waterjets via 4 x ZF 53000 
NRH gearboxes. All four waterjets are configured 
for steering and reversing, while an independent 
hydraulic system in each hull covers the steering 
and reverse functions.  Manoeuvring and directional 
control is enhanced through the use of retractable 
trim tabs that maximise moment force from water 
jet side/reverse thrust and optimisation of force/
moment positioning. 
Four Caterpillar 3406B 230kW generators are fitted, 
each being rated with a 10% for one hour overload 
capacity. The generators are arranged for automatic 
start-up and paralleling, the automation considering 
one unit maintained as a standby set.
Further improving the 98m wave piercing 
catamaran’s sea keeping qualities is the Maritime 
Dynamics/Incat Ride Control System, consisting of 
transom mounted trim tabs and a retractable T-foil. 
These, combined with Incat’s hull form featuring long 
outer bows, fuller midship sections, stern skeglets, 
and centre bow clearances, mean motion sickness 
incidence has been reduced by up to 40% in higher 
sea states by reducing pitch, roll and heave. 
The vehicle deck onboard Milenium Tres offers freight 
space for 380 truck lane metres at 3.1m wide x 4.35m 
clear height. The fitting of nine hoistable mezzanine 
vehicle decks gives the operator the flexibility to carry 
up to 267 cars, or 12 freight trailers with 180 cars, or 
24 road freight trailers with 85 cars while offering the 
headroom demanded by freight vehicles when raised. 
Suitable for heavy road transport vehicles the main 
vehicle deck also benefits from unrestricted height for 
6m and an unobstructed width of 18m at the stern.
Passenger spaces on Milenium Tres are located on 
one deck, with three distinctive lounge areas along its 
length, each featuring its own style of seating, colour 
scheme, and facilities.  The interiors are also different 
to her sister ships.
The wheelhouse onboard Milenium Tres provides 
360deg visibility for the officers over the top of the 
aerodynamic superstructure, while an aft-facing 
docking console and CCTV monitors negate the need 
for bridge wings with their associated windage and 
weight.
The area features a fully equipped bar with facilities 
to serve a wide variety of food and beverages. 
Outboard of the passenger walkways are two 
comfortable lounges where passengers may relax in 
Ocean Tourist High Back reclining seats, surrounded 
by panoramic windows again affording excellent 
sea views. Raised lounge areas immediately forward 
enable passengers to relax in Ocean Tub seating, 
arranged around tables. 
As always, safety is paramount and Milenium Tres is 
equipped with four Liferaft Systems Australia Marine 
Evacuation Stations, two port and two starboard. 
Each MES serves a total of 200 persons.  A total of 
ten 100-person rafts are fitted. Two SOLAS inflatable 
rescue boats, each with 30hp motors, are provided for 
launch and recovery operations.
Hobart-based company Colbeck & Gunton supply 
the lightweight structural fire protection system aboard 
Milenium Tres including fire doors and dampers. To 
protect all moderate and high risk spaces  The ‘Rapid 
Access’ (deckhead) and ‘Lightweight’ (bulkhead) fire 
protection system meets all the demands for lighter 
weight and faster installation/removal for this type

A 
new 11m interceptor craft, NB543, a compact 
version of the larger IC 16 M was delivered to 
the Mexican Navy by Dockstavarvet.   The craft was 
designed for patrolling littoral waters and inland 
waterways. 
The new vessel is characterised by an all-aluminium 
construction, a high-speed chine form, shallow draught 
and a low profile, and has been built and equipped to 
meet the requirements of Det Norske Veritas’ High 
Speed and Light Craft rules. 
The machinery comprises either a single or a twin 
installation providing speeds up to 50knots. In this 
particular version, the boat is powered by two Volvo 
Penta D9 diesel engines providing a total output of 
736kW (1000hp) and a sprint speed of more than 
42knots. The engines are driving two Rolls-Royce 
FF310 water jet units through ZF reduction gears and 
flexible shaft couplings.
The layout comprises three watertight compartments; 
forepeak, accommodation, and engineroom. The 
wheelhouse provides shock absorbing seats for coxswain 
and navigator, a sofa for up to three passengers, and a 
small galley. The accommodation below is arranged 
for crew comfort including beds, and a small working 
area.
The technical systems installed are based on proven 
CB 90 H solutions, developed for and together with 
the Swedish Navy. The air draught is kept less than 
3.50m enabling the craft to pass under bridges even 
at high waters. 
The low radar profile of the NB543 together with 
its extreme speed resources and manoeuvrability 
makes it a most powerful platform for police/security 
operations.

T
he multi function tender for the Northern 
Lighthouse Board was named and launched 
by HRH The Princess at the Gdansk Stocznia 
Remontowa yard, Poland.  The vessel NLV Pharos, is 
now based at Oban, Scotland, home of the Northern 
Lighthouse Board. 
The ship works now mainly in Scottish and Manx 
waters - the area covered by the board - servicing 
over 200 automatic lighthouses, buoys, and beacons 
and acts as a working platform for aids-to-navigation 
project work, as well as carrying out commercial work 
under contract. On occasion the ship will travel south 
to assist the other General Lighthouse Authorities, 
namely Trinity House and the Commissioners of Irish 
Lights.
In addition, NLV Pharos has been designed with the 
capability to carry out other offshore roles, including 
towing; hydrographic surveys; attendance at wrecks 
and wreck finding; transportation of personnel, plant 
and equipment to offshore stations; and support of 
safe workboat and helicopter operations.
Classified by Lloyd’s Register of Shipping, the 
vessel has a length overall of 84.20m, a moulded 
breadth of 16.50m, and a design draught of 4.25m.

A
n offshore logistical support vessel for Offshore 
Wind Power Marine Services Ltd, of Conwy, 
North Wales, was this year built by South Boats 
Special Projects Ltd.  Offshore Provider is a South 
Catamaran 44/14m Alloy WFSV.
The vessel has a 15m length overall, a 6.5m beam 
overall, a draught of 0.9m, and has a displacement 
weight of 20,000kg. This second of class vessel is 
to enter the Offshore Wind Power Marine Services 
fleet alongside Fastcat, the company’s existing South 
Catamaran 32/10m providing logistical solutions and 
engineer transfers to offshore wind farm builders and 
operators.
The vessel follows standard South Boats design 
principles with symmetrical underwater sections and 
asymmetrical wet deck knuckles and spray deflectors. 
The design includes a high buoyancy bow and triple 
internal spray knuckles to maintain a suspension of 
air/water to dampen pitching moments particularly 
in heavy weather.  
In addition, the hulls maintain a parallel waterline 
beam through the length of the vessel allowing for 
good weight distribution around the vessel.  The 
design offers class leading sea keeping, stability, fuel 
efficiency, and manoeuvrability.  The sea keeping in 
particular has been proven in service transferring 
engineers to wind farm turbines in conditions in 
excess of 2.5m significant wave height.
Twin Scania DI12 65M 500hp diesel engines are 
coupled to Twin Disc 5114A 1:1 ratio gearboxes 
driving Clarke’s drive shafts to Ultra Dynamics 376 
water jet units.  The port gearbox is fitted with an 
SAE A electrically clutched power take off powering 
the crane hydraulics whilst the starboard gearbox is 
fitted with an SAE B manually clutched power take 
off powering the capstan hydraulics.  The vessels 
hydraulic systems have been designed and supplied 
by Hercules Hydraulics Ltd.
This propulsion package offers the vessel a sprint 
speed in excess of 21knots and an 18knot plus fully 
loaded cruising speed at 1900rev/min.  At low 
cruising speeds (16knots) the vessel offers a frugal 
fuel consumption of 125litres per hour (7.5litres per 
mile) and high cruising speed (19knots) consumption 
of 160litres per hour (8.4litres per mile).  The 
performance of the vessel is staggering and the vessel 
can maintain cruising speeds in comfort in up to 
3m significant wave height, reportedly setting a new 
standard for a 14m vessel.
The vessel is fabricated of aluminium and is 
generally in accordance with Lloyd’s Special Service 
Craft Rules with all metal of marine grade 50830 
and 6082T6 extrusions meeting the requirements 
of Lloyd's Register and Shipping and Det Norske

O
ISS Patroller represents the culmination in 
the development of the Wave Handler class, 
from shipbuilder Alnmaritec. The vessel is an 
aluminium alloy catamaran which has been designed 
in conjunction with a number of major oil field 
operators specifically as an in-field support craft. 
This class has now emerged as an industry standard 
vessel for line and hose handling work. OISS Patroller 
can operate either as an FPSO/AHTS daughter craft 
where it is capable of being lifted on and off a mother 
ship or in terminal support operations.
The hull is based upon the successful Wave-Train 
hull form developed by Alnmaritec and has fine entry 
forward sections developing into medium deadrise 
single chine hull form aft.  OISS Patroller is capable 
of speeds of over 20knots whilst also being able to 
generate a static bollard pull of around 2tonnes. 
The boat is robustly built to deal with the rigors 
of in field operations. Solid round bars are fitted on 
both keels to allow the vessel to sit on deck without 
the need for a cradle and she has all-round rubber 
fendering. The waterjets are protected by a substantial 
bump guard frame but despite the strength of 
construction the weight of the boat has been kept to 
around 8tonnes to reduce the required capacity of the 
handling equipment.
Each of the hulls is divided into four watertight 
compartments with intermediate diaphragm frames 
and the void space between the hulls forms additional 
buoyancy. Independent port and starboard 450litre 
fuel tanks are situated in the void spaces forward of 
the engines.
The main deck, from the wheelhouse forward, has 
bulwarks and safety rails, which are set inboard to 
allow safe passage around the perimeter of the boat 
and a step up platform is provided on the bow, for 
safe access onto a calm buoy ladder. 
The aft working deck has substantial bulwarks to 
afford protection to personnel on deck and the stern 
working section has a step down at the aft end to 
provide a platform just above the waterline for access 
to lines and hoses.
A plinth is mounted aft of the wheelhouse, which 
supports a 2tonne capstan with stainless steel towing 
fairlead and horn cleat and a 500kg lift davit is fitted 
which has a hand winch but which can also be used in 
conjunction with the capstan. 
The vessel has four lifting points for use with a 
crane and as an option a pair of off-load release hooks 
for davit lifting may be installed on the transom and 
aft of the bow platform. Engine room, void space, 
and jet access hatches are all flush fitting to give a 
clear working deck.
All controls are located in a console within the 
wheelhouse and a sun canopy and weather cover are 
provided aft of the wheelhouse to protect a seating 
area for up to six persons. Dog steps are provided 
to access the top of the wheelhouse, as the mast can 
be raised or lowered for protection when deploying 
or retrieving the vessel using a davit. A manually 
operated searchlight and two Halogen working deck 
lights are also mounted on the wheelhouse roof and 
protected by tubular bump frame.

T
he Rolls-Royce-designed UT 712 L, Olympic 
Octopus, multi-functional anchor handling tug 
supply vessel is owned by Olympic Shipping, based 
in Fosnavåg, in Norway, and operates on a long term 
contract to BP. Olympic Octopus, built by Aker Yards, 
Søviknes, features the full range of new Rolls-Royce 
offshore solutions, including systems for making 
deck work easier and safer, DP2 dynamic positioning, 
and a rim drive tunnel thruster. 
The type UT 712 has become a well-respected 
offshore vessel since the original design was introduced 
in the 1980s. While keeping the successful concept, 
advantage has been taken of all the improvements in 
ship design over the years. A thoroughly up-to-date 
hull design has been developed for this vessel, with 
a bulb bow and Ice IC class, combining efficient 
propulsion and station keeping with low motions in 
a seaway. 
This 16,000hp AHTS is 78.3m long overall, giving 
a working deck area of 900m² on the 17.2m beam. 
All the normal supplies can be carried including 
glycol and base oil and there is in addition tankage for 
1000m³ of recovered oil. Accommodation is provided 
for a crew of 28 plus space for 280 survivors under 
NMB rules for the vessel’s safety standby role. Olympic 
Octopus meets strict environmental requirements, with 
Clean class notation, and is designed to provide its 
crew with safe working conditions and comfortable 
living quarters. 
Olympic Shipping’s UT 712 L is the first to include 
all the Rolls-Royce systems that have been under 
development for improving safety for crew working 
on deck.  Two cranes can travel the full length of the 
bulwarks on rails. Their boom lengths are adjusted 
to be able to pick and place equipment at any point 
on the deck. They also have Rolls-Royce arms and 
tools handling wires. Each crane can handle 3tonnes 
at 12.5m outreach or 5tonnes at 9m, enabling 5tonne 
items to be moved anywhere about the deck.
For towing there is a main two drum winch with 
a 400tonne pull and 550T brake load, with a very 
large wire capacity for deep water operations. The 
secondary winch is rated at 138T, handling wire 
or synthetic fibre rope. Aft are two sets of the new 
Rauma Brattvaag shark jaws and towing pins, the 
centring system for leading wires to this equipment, 
and a stern roller.
Two Bergen BV12 long stroke engines power the 
new Olympic Shipping vessel, turning twin screws 
in nozzles assisted by two tunnel thrusters aft plus 
a tunnel thruster and a swing-up azimuth thruster 
forward. One of the aft tunnel thrusters is a new 
Rolls-Royce product – the first 800kW rim drive 
tunnel thruster to go into service.
The propulsion and manoeuvring equipment 
can be placed under the command of a new Rolls-
Royce dynamic positioning system. It operates via 
the UMAS control system and takes its positioning 
information from a variety of reference sources. The 
system has the redundancy required for IMO DP2.
Three of the original type UT 712 offshore vessels 
were constructed in the 1980s, and four more updated 
versions have been built or ordered in the past three 
years. The lengthened L-version is proving popular, 
and in addition to Olympic Octopus, seven more UT 712 
L vessels have been ordered by various owners for 
delivery in the period 2006-2008. All are configured 
to suit the owners’ requirements.

W
hen Svitzer Wijsmuller was awarded an offshore 
support contract for operations in Qatar, the 
company turned to Singapore’s Strategic Marine to 
design and built a vessel best-suited to the very 
stringent specification and operational requirements. 
The result is a fleet of  three 31m wellhead 
maintenance vessels capable of carrying large amounts 
(up to 50tonnes) of deck cargo on a timber sheathed 
deck and the crews to and from the oil platforms in 
passenger ferry comfort. To achieve these results the 
operators and designers, Strategic Marine and Southerly 
Designs, of Dongara, Western Australia, worked closely 
to produce the optimum vessel which would also be 
economical and reliable in service and be capable of 
meeting the speed requirements to achieve the response 
times set by the oil platform operators. 
The vessels: Svitzer Al Shamal, Svitzer Al Safliya, and 
Svitzer Al Shaqab have top speeds of 20knots, can 
carry 42 passengers, 50tonnes of cargo, and have crew 
accommodation for eight people. The vessels will be 
used to transport maintenance crew and equipment 
to and between oil and gas platforms and rigs in and 
around Halul Island for Qatar Petroleum.
The main deck passenger cabin is fitted out to ferry 
standard with seating for 42 people, and is fitted with 
high temperature and high humidity air-conditioning, 
and a video and audio entertainment system. The 
safety of the passengers and crew is catered for by a 
fully-monitored fire detection system, the provision 
of inflatable life-rafts and a GMDSS communications 
system with EPIRB and SART location transponders.
The bridge, located on the upper level, has all-round 
vision and is fitted with two control stations – the main 
helm station facing forward with the second station 
facing aft. The aft control station is used when the boat 
is manoeuvring to and from the platforms. Loading and 
offloading of crew and gear is traditionally carried out 
with the boat stern-to at the rig platforms, and in port 
and the transom is left open (protected by removable 
chains) for this purpose. 
Facilities 
include 
air-conditioned 
crew 
accommodation for eight, in three cabins, a crew 
mess, a galley, and bathroom located below decks. Aft 
of the accommodation is a plant room and aft of that 
is the main engine room. A tank area and the tiller flat 
complete the below deck compartments. 
The entire vessel is constructed out of  low 
maintenance aluminium and all seawater piping is 
of stainless steel. The cargo deck is covered with 
a protective layer of thick marine pine planks which 
protect the structure from shock loads during cargo 
handling and minimises the possibility of cargo sliding. 
The planking can be easily removed to gain access to 
the engine room located in the centre of the vessel. 
Cargo deck capacity is 2tonnes/m2.
The vessel is powered by Caterpillar C32 diesel engines 
rated at 1400bhp, driving three aluminium bronze FP 
propellers through Twin Disc 6619C gearboxes. 
Care for the environment has been a major factor 
in the design and outfitting and is catered for with the 
inclusion of an oily water separator and a Grocco TP-
210 sewage treatment plant along with the allocation 
of tank space to store the by-products of both systems 
until they can be disposed of safely ashore.

The main propulsion engines are twin Cummins 
QSC 8.3M diesels, each rated at 490hp with Twin 
Disc gears.  For onboard electrical service, an 8.0kW 
Northern Lights generator and 50amp shore power 
are provided.   Fully operational, the boat achieves a 
maximum speed of just under 30knots and a service 
speed of 22knots at 70% MCR.
The Evans replaced the survey vessel Blair. With its 
increased speed and lighter draught, the new vessel has 
maximised the Corps’ survey capabilities.

L
eading lifeboat and davit supplier, Schat-
Harding, has expanded production at its Chinese 
plant to build the first of a series of new design high-
speed patrol boats. The first 10m UP1000 patrol boat 
can reach 32knots, and was delivered during March 
to Shan Dong Maritime Safety Administration, for 
use in coastal patrol work. 
The vessel was especially designed in China for 
coastal patrol work by China’s maritime authorities 
and Schat-Harding Qingdao built more vessels for 
other Chinese regional coastal administrations in 
2006, and is planning export the boat.
The vessel has a length overall of 10.19m, a length 
between perpendiculars of 8.8m, a moulded breadth 
of 3.08m, and a moulded depth of 1.27m. UP1000 has 
a gross tonnage of 5.9gt, a deadweight of 5.5tonnes, 
a lightweight of 4.75tonnes, and a displacement of 
5tonnes.  She has been classed with the rules and 
regulations for the construction of sea-going high-
speed craft 1996.
UP1000 has a glass-fibre twin hull and double 
knuckle configuration. She has been equipped with 
two Volvo D3-160/DP engines with an output of 
120kW; the vessel can reach a maximum speed of 
31knots, and has a service speed of 25knots.  Both the 
gearbox and propeller are provided together with the 
Volvo engine.  The vessel can also be fitted for engine 
options giving up to 45knots top speed.
As expected, UP1000 has a full complement of 
bridge electronics, including an ICOM MR-1000R(II) 
radar and an ICOM IC-M45 VHF. The vessel has 
facilities for a crew of two, and from two to six 
passengers. There are two cabins.

N
orwegian shipyard Westplast AS, based in Leinøy, 
delivered to PGS Geophysical, in March, a new 
prototype 9.50m seismic survey boat for worldwide 
surveying duties. 
Designed by Westplast AS and Sundal Engineering 
AS the GRP hull reportedly provides a smooth and 
stable ride. WP 950’s transom has been designed with a 
recess to incorporate the waterjets and engine exhaust 
system.
Fitted with twin UltraJet 305HT waterjets coupled to 
Yanmar 340hp 6LYA-STP engines the boat achieved 
30knots during North Sea trials and a bollard pull 
of  2.6tonne at 3000rev/min. The UltraJet control 
system, which is connected to the electronically driven 
helmsman’s seat, gives fingertip control and precise 
manoeuvrability at all speeds. Using waterjets also gives 
the craft the ability to also work in very shallow draught 
waters safely.
This is the first of two boats that are being considered 
by PGS Geophysical for its new fleet of survey craft.
WP 950 will be used for survey exploration and 
recovery work and can carry a crew of four, as well as 
surveying equipment.
Onboard electronics include a Seiwa Mk III, black 
box ecosounder 50/200kHz, black box radar and 20” 
screen, Navman 7200 VHF, UHF, Autopilot ComNav 
1440, and Compasspoint G2 GPS system.
The craft has a towing force of 2600kg, a cable lifter 
of 20kg, a 1500kg main winch and a secondary winch 
on the bow.
