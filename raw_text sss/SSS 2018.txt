ailed as the first LNG-powered ferry to have 
been built in North America, the 92m 
Armand-Imbeau II has also been described by 
Québec’s Chantier Davie Canada Inc. as “paving 
the way in setting a new environmental standard 
for the entire continent”. 
The steel vessel’s delivery has also put Canada 
on the map when it comes to territories creating 
what might be referred to as the ‘first wave’ of 
LNG-fuelled passenger ships. The dual-fuel, 
double-ended vessel was constructed for 
government-owned provincial operator Société 
des Traversiers du Québec (STQ) as the first of 
two LNG-equipped ferries designed by local 
firm Concept Naval: the sister vessel, Jos-
Deschenes II, left Davie’s yard soon after. 
Intended for year-round availability, the ferry 
has been ice-strengthened, in recognition of the 
treacherous weather conditions that affect eastern 
Canada in winter, including ice thicknesses of up 
to 1m. The ferry, Davie adds, is “highly automated 
for use by a smaller crew”, with “more than 6,800 
inputs/outputs into the main automation system 
– compared to 3,500 for a naval vessel and 
roughly 6,000 for a semisubmersible offshore 
drilling rig.” As one example, the ferry has been 
built with fully automated shutdown systems, 
which will automatically activate in the event of a 
breach in gas safety. 
In line with the Government of Québec’s 
ongoing Maritime Strategy, which seeks to 
protect the biodiversity of ecosystems in and 
around the St Lawrence River, it was decided to 
enable Armand-Imbeau II and her sister to run 
entirely on LNG, in order to slash NOx levels by 
as much as 90%, and to virtually nullify sulphur 
and fine particle emissions. 
This was a challenging task, necessitating 
much research and risk assessment, which was 
conducted in cooperation with class society 
Lloyd’s Register and national regulatory body 
Transport Canada. 
As Ron Pearson, Davie’s vice president of 
engineering, puts it: “The cryogenic processes 
involved in managing this highly volatile fuel, 
while also creating a vessel which is safe to carry 
passengers, has been a huge challenge. Integrating 
all of these systems into such a confined space 
was even more challenging, and one we are very 
proud to have overcome.” Another challenge was 
managing the precise installation of more than 
150,000m of cable on board. 
All major power and propulsion equipment, 
with the exception of the thrusters, was 
supplied by Wärtsilä.  This package included 
two 6L20 DF and two 9L20 DF engines, coupled 
to ABB alternators, representing 5,634kVA of 
total installed power. The DF brand stands for 
‘dual fuel’ and can accommodate both LNG and 
MDO – of which the vessel can store 
approximately 45tonnes and 50tonnes 
respectively. The ferry’s main electrical systems 
include two main switchboards, two propulsion 
thruster drives and two ABB-manufactured 
propulsion motors. 
Armand-Imbeau II has also been fitted with 
Wärtsilä’s C-type LNGPac storage tank, which 
comes with evaporators, gas valve units and 
automation and safety systems. The ferry’s 
thrusters were supplied by Schottel, and comprise 
TYP SRP 4000 fixed-pitch models, each rated 
2,200kW and certified to Ice Class 1AS. 
Armand-Imbeau II’s design also incorporates a 
2m car deck and a 2.2m mezzanine deck. In 
terms of safety, the vessel is equipped with 462 
adult, 165 child and 12 infant lifejackets, in 
addition to a six-person rescue boat with a 
30kW engine. The ferry also carries 14 buoys 
and three emergency evacuation slides, while a 
fixed water mist system safeguards her 
machinery spaces.

B
uilt to provide a fast and comfortable 
connection for guests and employees of the 
Bürgenstock Resort in Switzerland, the shuttle 
ferry Bürgenstock has been tasked with a 
demanding 17 hours of operation daily, seven 
days a week, providing a service between the 
resort and the city centre of Lucerne, taking in 
Lake Lucerne. 
The ferry has incorporated a parallel hybrid 
system, described by builder/designer Shiptec as 
an improvement on the system that was 
developed in cooperation with Siemens Marine 
Systems for the five-deck mini-cruise vessel 
Diamant, which was delivered in 2017 (see 
Significant Small Ships of 2017, pages 62-64). 
This system was tweaked to suit Bürgenstock’s 
specific operations and to reduce fuel during the 
ferry’s gruelling working day. 
Shiptec explains: “Even though the system 
architecture of the hybrid system is similar to 
former projects, the operational mode differs a 
lot. Based on the particular load case, the ferry 
sails partly on pure electric propulsion. The 
route between Lucerne and Bürgenstock 
navigates partly through a speed-limited area 
where the vessel runs at 8knots purely on battery 
power for approximately half of the travelling 
time.” For the other half, Bürgenstock uses her 
twin diesel engines to simultaneously navigate at 
17.5knots and recharge the batteries. In 
switching off the diesel engines within the area 
with speed restrictions, the ferry is able to realise 
fuel savings. In the long haul, it is also expected 
that this reduced drain on the Scania engines 
will result in a significant reduction in 
maintenance-related costs.  
The ferry’s hulls incorporate a wave-piercing 
design, which Shiptec credits with enabling a top 
speed of just above 20knots – although, the 
company adds, “the speed in this particular 
operation has been limited to 19knots”. The 
vessel has also been built as a modular concept: 
for instance, one entire hybrid drive is easily 
accessible and can be replaced by lifting it off the 
hull and swapping it for a spare unit within six 
hours, to minimise disruption. 
Bürgenstock’s wheelhouse has been installed 
on the main deck, and large windows have been 
built into the upper deck area to offer 
passengers panoramic views during the Lake 
Lucerne crossings. 
The wheelhouse is situated on the main deck 
to enhance direct communication during 
landing manoeuvres.

ittoria Shipyard’s pledge to diversify further 
into tug production resulted in the March 
2018 delivery of Cap de Fer, an ASD tug 
completed for Algeria’s Skikda Port Authority, 
situated in the country’s north-west, close to the 
border with Tunisia. The Italian boatbuilder 
managed to fend off rival tenders from 14 
international boatyards to scoop this contract, as 
part of chairman Luigi Duò’s ambitions to add 
tugs to its roster of offerings, which has 
traditionally more typically included patrol and 
SAR craft, plus small tankers and fishing boats.
The Bureau Veritas-classed vessel can 
displace 500tonnes, fully laden, and 
accommodate up to seven crew members. Two 
medium-speed diesel engines, supplied by 
Anglo Belgian Corporation (ABC), grant the 
vessel a top speed of 12.5knots and a bollard 
pull (bp) of 42tonnes -  reportedly well above 
the initial request of the Skikda Port Authority, 
which initially specified a bp of 30tonnes. 
Cap de Fer’s scope of roles includes: port and 
coastal towing services; assistance and emergency 
response operations in extreme conditions; and 
conducting push-pull operations. As such, special 
focus was put on maximising the tug’s power/
performance ratio and ability to comfortably 
manoeuvre in harsh sea and weather conditions. 
Visibility was also deemed a top priority, as was a 
robust structure to shield crew from collision-
related bumps and shocks. The fitting and 
arrangement of onboard equipment was also 
planned to enable easy and safe access to those 
components most likely to require maintenance 
and repair work. Designed and built for 
challenging workloads, and with a fuel capacity of 
nearly 162tonnes, Cap de Fer can count on 12 
days of autonomy between required port calls. 
Meanwhile, her firefighting system, supplied by 
Jason Engineering, features an engine-powered 
pump feeding a pair of water- and foam-equipped 
monitors, each rated 600,000litres per hour. As a 
demonstrator of its ability to successfully diversify 
into relatively new vessel types, Cap de Fer certainly 
represents a high point for Vittoria. And, with a 
second ASD tug, designed to dismantle nuclear 
submarines, launched in September 2018 and due 
for handover to the Russian Government in 2019, 
it’s clear that the yard’s interest in these hardy 
vessel types is far from being a one-off fling.

lean Jacksonville may be North America’s first 
ever LNG bunker barge, though she was 
developed by a worldwide design team, 
comprising: Bristol Harbor Group (US, hull 
design); GTT (France, for the cargo-containment 
and cargo-handling design); GasEntec (South 
Korea, handling the control and automation 
system design); and DH Industries (DHI) 
(Netherlands, reliquefaction system design).
The significance of this vessel is that it is a first 
of its kind on many fronts. It is the first LNG 
bunker barge built in the US under US Coast 
Guard (USCG) and ABS guidelines and rules. 
This alone was an extremely meticulous task as 
many of the rules for future LNG projects in the 
US were being written based on Clean 
Jacksonville’s design, setting a clearer path 
forward for LNG adoption in the US. To 
accomplish this, the shipyard and its partners 
held bi-weekly conference calls for the entire 
duration of the project, with regulatory officials 
from across the country reviewing the design 
and ensuring that the correct safety measures 
were being implemented.  The barge is designed 
to be unmanned and thus has full automation 
for cargo management.
The GTT Mark III Flex cargo containment 
system represents the first time a membrane tank 
has been installed not only in the US but on a 
small-scale vessel.  As the labour skills required 
for installation of the membrane system were in 
short supply in the US, the shipyard selected a 
special group of existing personnel and trained 
them, with assistance from GTT, for 15 months 
prior to the first membrane panel installation. 
This extensive training ensured that proper 
protocol would be followed for the intricate 
containment system installation.  
The DHI reliquefaction system comprises 
Stirling Cryocoolers, which were designed and 
prototype-tested by ABS particularly for this 
application, and these are the only units of their 
kind operating in the world.  After working with 
suppliers worldwide, DHI was selected to 
provide a liquefaction system for small-scale 
LNG with the footprint needed for this size of 
project. The six units are automated to control 
vapour by assigning a set point for cargo 
pressure and the units will individually cycle on 
and off according to the load.
Clean Jacksonville is also the first ever project 
to feature GTT’s innovative REACH4 LNG 
bunker mast. Denoting ‘Refuelling Equipment 
Arm, CH4 Methane’, REACH4 applies methods 
for conventional fuelling adapted to LNG-
specific constraints, and is well suited for 
bunkering most ships, whatever their bunker 
station arrangement. The mast is fitted with 
breakaway couplings for safe and reliable 
emergency disconnections. Shipbuilder Conrad 
explains: “We were able to integrate the GTT 
cargo handling systems into a bunker mast that 
luffs up to 60degs and slews 320degs, while 
using a cryogenic swivel in the pedestal to allow 
the mast to manoeuvre while maintaining 
integrity of the cryogenic liquid.”
The GasEntec-designed Control, Automation & 
Monitoring System (CAMS) allows the 
unmanned barge to manage boil-off gas and keep 
the vessel in a safe and ready state without the 
need for continuous manning.  Every system, 
from power generation to reliquefaction, has 
redundancy (some have multiple redundancies) 
and is monitored through the CAMS, which 
sends wireless communication via the 
TELEMETRY system to the attending tug which 
can be on standby within the area of the barge. 
The operators can monitor the vessel’s pressure, 
temperature, machinery and other systems while 
aboard the tug remotely.

T
he revolutionary shape of the new generation 
of transportation vessels developed by 
Advanced Aerodynamic Vessels (A2V) is 
intended to safely transfer ships’ weight from 
water to air solely by using the wind generated 
by the boat’s speed. This passive aerodynamic 
support represents between 30-60% of overall 
ship’s weight at cruising speed, A2V says, 
depending on the application. “Instead of 
fighting against the apparent wind like 
conventional fast vessels, the A2V vessel uses it 
to alleviate itself,” the group says. 
A2V continues: “Our research and 
development methods rely on two main 
approaches. Numerical tool developments 
based on unsteady CFD computations, both 
aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, on one 
hand; and a heavily instrumented, full-scale 
10.5m prototype on the other.” Measurement 
systems included IMUs, direct thrust 
measurement and anemometers, for example, 
and these experimental results allowed the 
validation of the numerical tools regarding fuel 
consumption, drag, vertical accelerations in the 
waves and manoeuvrability at all speeds.
The first prototype of this type, developed in 
2015, has sailed three years, spanning 5,000nm, 
in various conditions (including winds of up to 
30knots and wave heights up to 2m) without a 
single failure, A2V claims, adding: “Speeds of 
up to 61knots were recorded and the patented 
passive safety gives entire satisfaction. The 
patent relies on a simple fact: the vessel’s center 
of gravity is placed forward from the 
aerodynamic center of effort. This means that 
when apparent wind increases, the boat reduces 
its angle of attack, hence reducing lift: it is a 
self-adjusting system.” 
Extensive 
high-speed 
hydrodynamic 
computations were required to develop hull 
shapes able to carry this unusual weight 
distribution and have a satisfying behavior at all 
speeds, the group notes. This passive stability 
makes the A2V vessels safe and easy to maintain, 
without any electronic or active control devices, 
it adds. “Unlike SES, hovercrafts or foilers, they 
remain safe at low and intermediate speeds in 
case of very bad weather – in fact, they turn into 
conventional catamarans with a high crossdeck 
and narrow hulls,” A2V explains. 
The success of the prototype led to two 
contracts being signed in early 2016. One of 
these was for the A2V-25-CB passenger 
crewboat, developed and built following a 
detailed 
specification 
from 
Peschaud 
International – the vessel that would become 
Clementine, and which is now operating in 
Gabon, Africa. “In addition to oil company, flag 
and class requirements, Peschaud asked for 
waterjet propulsion, business class-standard 
seats and large space per passenger,” ASV recalls. 
Subsequently, Clementine was developed with 
specific hulls for this application and ASV 
pushed both structural optimisation as well as 
regulation studies to address these requirements 
within the initial weight estimate.

T
he low-emissions, double-ended ferries Dame 
Vera Lynn and Ben Woollacott have provided 
a welcome, green boost to the UK capital, 
bolstering Transport for London’s (TfL’s) multi-
million pound upgrade to the historic Woolwich 
crossing – a daytime service connecting east and 
south-east London, and one responsible for 
carrying over 2.6 million passengers and 1 
million vehicles every year, operated on behalf of 
TfL by Briggs Marine Contractors. 
Incorporating the correct technologies to ensure 
compliance with London’s Low Emission Zone 
(LEZ) criteria, each vessel is capable of carrying 
150 passengers and features 200 lane metres of 
space for vehicles across four lanes. The ferries run 
on hybrid diesel-electric power for enhanced fuel 
efficiency and low noise and vibrations, with the 
hybrid sets provided by Norwegian Electric 
Systems. This concept has allowed the operator to 
fit smaller-than-usual diesel engines on board – a 
factor that could result in fuel savings of 15% 
compared to a conventional modern propulsion 
system, LMG Marin predicts. Furthermore, the 
ferries  burn ultra-low sulphur diesel fuel and the 
gensets have been fitted with both a selective 
catalytic reduction (SCR) system and a diesel 
particulate filter (DPF), to produce up to 95% less 
particulate matter and 70% less NOx.
To simplify the recharging process, the new 
shore-side infrastructure has been equipped 
with Mampaey automatic mooring systems. 
Keel Marine elaborates: “While berthed, the 
power to the thruster units is reduced to zero 
and the diesel generating set recharges the 
Li-ion battery bank.” In normal operation on 
each transit, a single genset is run at near-
constant load to meet peak demand in 
conjunction with the battery installation. When 
the propulsive power requirement is low, the 
excess generated energy recharges the batteries. 
Manoeuvrability was also a key consideration, 
as the high-frequency shuttle operation 
necessitates crossing a tidal flow of 4knots or 
stronger. Consequently, Hydromaster was 
contracted to fit each ferry with four azimuthing 
drive units, rated 300kW apiece, with one unit 
situated on each corner of the vessel. These are 
powered by double wound electric motors 
vertically mounted on the tops of the units. 
Propulsion controls comprise two combined 
throttle and azimuthing levers: one to control 
the bow units, the other for the stern units. 
As another concession towards energy 
conservation, each ferry makes use of LED 
lighting. Vessel access has been arranged in a 
step-free, segregated manner, enabling 
pedestrians, cyclists and vehicle users to access 
separate areas on board for quicker – as well as 
safer – turnaround times.

S
ummer 2018 proved to be a real scorcher – 
and, as such, the ideal testing ground for the 
first EcoCat solar-powered, all-electric ferry. The 
vessel was originally produced on spec with the 
aim 
of 
spearheading 
a 
new 
breed 
of 
environmentally friendly yet operationally 
efficient boats within the Mediterranean – an 
area blessed by ample sunshine, which the EcoCat 
can convert into fuel.  
The vessel bypasses traditional combustion 
engines and gensets, adopting instead a pure-
electric powertrain, incorporating a combination 
of roof-mounted solar panels and interior battery 
packs. A total of 120 solar panels were used to 
guarantee production of around 40kWh of solar 
energy and a consequent speed of 6-7knots. 
Electric propulsion specialist Torqeedo supplied 
the EcoCat with two of its Deep Blue 80i 1400-
brand electric shaft drives, one on each hull. 
These are rated 50kW at 1,400rpm apiece. As an 
additional, weight-related bonus, each Deep Blue 
motor only weighs 85kg. 
The motors are fed by eight BMW i-3 lithium-
ion (Li-ion) batteries, four situated in each hull, 
which were marinised by Torqeedo. Each battery is 
rated 30.5kWh at peak capacity, meaning the vessel 
can store up to 244kWh of captured solar energy in 
total. As well as saving both fuel costs and onboard 
space, this all-electric approach has reduced noise 
and vibrations and virtually eliminated emissions. 
Torqeedo designed a ‘cool room’ environment 
for each hull – essentially turning each hull into 
an air-conditioned compartment in which the 
temperature is kept to a steady 20°C. The air-
con unit is run off the high-voltage battery 
banks. The batteries’ storage capacity can 
guarantee eight hours of operation without 
sunshine, for minimal disruption during 
occasional cloudy periods. 
Interestingly, as the required 120 solar panels 
proved too many to fit on the vessel’s proposed 
roof, builder Metaltec devised a pair of 
retractable, pneumatic ‘wings’ for the vessel, one 
on each side. Fashioned from aluminium, each 
wing is extendable in parallel fashion at roof-
level and is fitted with the requisite amount of 
extra solar panels. The wings can be extended 
and closed by the vessel’s crew, via switches on 
the control console in the bridge. 
Other onboard features include wheelchair-
accessible corridors and a dedicated bicycle 
storage space, situated on the stern deck. And, by 
incorporating recyclable aluminium throughout 
her structure, it is hoped that the EcoCat will also 
have a minimal impact on her environment when 
she eventually retires from service.

D
elivered in August 2018, the service operation 
vessel (SOV) Edda Mistral (along with her 
sister, Edda Passat) was ordered to service offshore 
wind farms: in this case, both vessels have been 
placed under contract with Ørsted (formerly Dong 
Energy) for an initial period of five years. 
In addition to providing services at the 
573MW Race Bank wind farm off the UK coast, 
Edda Mistral has been deployed at Hornsea One, 
situated east of Race Bank. When completed in 
2020, Hornsea One will generate 1.2GW of 
power for UK households. 
Edda Mistral’s main function is to serve as a 
mothership for turbine technicians, as well as a 
carrier of equipment and provisions. The vessel can 
accommodate up to 40 of these industrial personnel, 
as well as 20 members of crew – and, as might be 
expected from a vessel intended to spend significant 
periods of time in deepwater environments, each 
person on board has access to a cabin. 
As with her sister, Edda Mistral has been 
equipped with a heave-compensated ‘walk-to-
work’ gangway, measuring 23m in length and 
supplied by Uptime, to ensure a comfortable and 
safe way for the workers to move between the 
SOV and the turbines, even in harsh weather 
conditions and high tides. 
The vessel also features a 3D-compensated crane 
and a crew transfer vessel (CTV) landing system 
with a bunkering facility, from which personnel 
can launch and land an 11m daughter craft – 
thereby creating an alternative means for the 
technicians to access the wind park when weather 
conditions are favourable. In addition, the 
Gondán-built ship has been fitted with a helideck. 
And, as is becoming increasingly common 
these days, the Rolls-Royce-designed vessel also 
boasts a touch of green craft technology, in the 
form of a selective catalytic reduction system, 
keeping her NOx emissions to a minimum. For 
the benefit of crew and technicians, Edda Mistral 
also features onboard facilities for meetings and 
WiFi connectivity.

he ongoing green craft tech revolution has 
spread to the US, with August 2018 witnessing 
the delivery of the 39m Enhydra – hailed as the 
largest aluminium-hulled, lithium-ion battery 
hybrid-powered vessel in North America to have 
been built under US Coast Guard (USCG) 
Subchapter K certification to date. Designed by 
Teknicraft Design of New Zealand and 
constructed by All American Marine in the US, 
the vessel commenced operations in September, 
under the control of Red and White Fleet. 
The vessel boasts three decks, granting 
passengers attractive views of renowned 
Californian landmarks such as San Francisco Bay 
and the Golden Gate Bridge. The second level of 
the vessel has been fitted with a full wrap-around 
viewing deck, providing access to the enlarged 
bow foredeck – an area that should prove a 
popular photo spot, the operator anticipates.  The 
top deck, meanwhile, is completely open and 
hosts external seating. 
Developed to carry up to 600 passengers, 
Enhydra can operate in diesel-electric or silent 
engine modes – the latter mode being deemed 
particularly useful for passengers who wish to 
film their surroundings. Her design can also 
accommodate additional batteries, enabling the 
operator to switch to all-electric operation on all 
routes when the anticipated ‘rapid charging’ 
infrastructure eventually comes online. 
To complement her electric means of propulsion, 
Teknicraft selected aluminium for the vessel’s 
material, so as to reduce the lightship displacement 
and, in turn, limit the wetted area and resistance. 
According to Teknicraft: “Computational fluid 
dynamic analysis was performed to design a hull 
shape with minimal wave resistance, without 
compromising on the required stability to carry 
600 passengers on three decks.”
BAE Systems served as hybrid propulsion 
integrator for this newbuild, while the Li-ion 
Energy Storage System (ESS) was supplied by 
Corvus Energy. BAE’s HybridDrive propulsion 
system was selected, offering an integral starter 
generator, propulsion power converter and 
hotel load power supply and control systems. 
The generator has been mounted to a variable-
speed Cummins diesel engine. The system 
offers parallel hybrid powering of the AC 
traction motor from either the generator, the 
batteries or both. 
The motor is coupled to the propulsion shaft 
via a reduction gear, for improved thrust and 
propeller efficiency. This set-up also means that 
torque is immediately available to the propeller, 
granting enhanced control over speed.  An 
auxiliary power system has also been installed, 
to provide electrical power from either the 
batteries or the diesel engine: this unit will be 
used to drive thrusters and cover other onboard 
sources of power drain. 
It is calculated that a typical Golden Gate 
Bridge sightseeing cruise aboard Enhydra, 
lasting approximately one hour, will use 
200kWh of energy. Given that the vessel has 
approximately 320kWh of installed battery 
capacity, and that her route will benefit from 
rapid shore charging facilities in the future, it is 
safe to say that most of her cruises will be 
conducted utilising electric power only. 
And more is to come: speaking after her 
handover, Red and White’s vice president of 
operations, Joe Burgard, commented: “We see 
the propulsion configuration on Enhydra as 
phase one in our move towards the full 
electrification of our fleet.”

T
he Reverse Stern Drive (RSD) WID Tug 
2915 Hybrid Fregate is a unique harbour 
tug, designed to provide a single vessel that is a 
fully functional tug with 42.5tonnes of bollard 
pull, fitted with a water injection dredging 
(WID) system that enables it to maintain the 
depths of the harbours of Cayenne and Kourou 
in French Guiana.
The reason for the unusual design arose from 
the specific requirements of the contracting port 
authority GPM-Guyane, which manages both 
ports. The authority recognised that specialist 
tugs and dredgers could not be kept fully 
occupied at its locations, and so, in its 2016 
renewal tender, it specified that designs be 
submitted that combined both attributes in two 
separate vessels – one of which would become the 
RSD WID Tug 2915 Hybrid.
To achieve this, Dutch Dredging, which had been 
working with GPM-Guyane for 15 years, teamed up 
with tug expert Iskes Towage & Salvage to form De 
Boer Remorquage SARL. The design process has 
been very much a joint effort: for instance, Dutch 
Dredging contributed its knowledge of the unique 
technique of water and air injection dredging that it 
has built up over 20 years, plus its experience of 
more than 15 years of operating in the specific 
conditions of French Guiana. Iskes Towage & 
Salvage, meanwhile, provided valuable input for the 
towage element of the design and build process. 
GPM-Guyane contributed to the development 
of the designs via its consultants, Hydro GC 
and Earthcase. They checked and approved the 
designs, and helped optimise the dredging/
towing balance so as to achieve an equilibrium 
within the given specifications. As well as 
assisting vessels as they enter and leave port, 
the RSD WID Tug 2915 Hybrid is equipped for 
other roles including firefighting (FiFi1) and 
equipment transportation.
WID – or, to give it its full name, air and water 
injection dredging (AIRSET) –  is a relatively 
new dredging technique that is particularly 
suited to smaller, tidal harbours. It works by 
‘fluidising’ the sediment layer using waterjets 
and injecting air to bring the sediments to the 
surface where the air can escape and the 
sediment can flow horizontally out of the 
harbour or channel using natural processes and 
forces. This removes the need for the physical 
extraction and transportation of the sediment, 
thereby reducing disruption to port traffic.

esigned by Elliott Bay Design Group (EBDG) 
of Seattle, and built by Jesse Engineering of 
Tacoma, Global Provider is the first vessel of its 
design and size for owner Maxum Petroleum and 
will be used to deliver fuel and lube oil to ship 
operators in the Pacific Northwest. 
Global Provider is a self-propelled bunker ship 
which conforms to ABS-issued loadline and class 
certification under ABS Sub-Chapter D rules for 
steel vessels under 90m. The vessel is equipped with 
a cargo handling system, featuring six pairs of cargo 
tanks, and is designed to move segregated products 
in a single trip, without cross-contamination.  For 
safe and responsible handling, the vessel is able to 
provide advanced tank-level monitoring courtesy of 
its electronic Bergan Guard-Level quad stick system.
In the engine room, a pair of Cummins QSK 
19M Tier 3 diesel engines provides propulsive 
power.  These two in-line, six-cylinder engines 
each turn Twin Disc MGX5170D 3.12:1 reduction 
gears swinging 1.2m, four-bladed stainless-steel 
FPP props.  A pair of Northern Lights 65kW Tier 3 
generators meets the boat's electrical and hydraulic 
power requirements.  
"We wanted a versatile vessel that would provide 
the highest level of environmental protection and 
compliance and allow Maxum to efficiently provide 
its diesel and lube oil customers in Puget Sound," 
says Maxum Petroleum's Mike Curry. "We have a 
15,000-barrel barge on the job, but this new boat 
with a lightship displacement of 325tonnes will be 
able to more efficiently handle our factory 
processor and ATB-tug customers. While oil barges 
typically target the deep-draught commercial 
sector, Global Provider is sized to service a wider 
range of vessels and avoid the problematic overflow 
and storm-water risks and implications associated 
with refuelling by multiple tanker trucks."
As part of its high level of versatility, the vessel 
has the capability for emergency and oil spill 
response.  The vessel is equipped with a FLIR 
thermal imaging system, giving the crew complete 
visual ability in darkness, fog and smoke. 
Firefighting capabilities include two Ansul 4" foam 
monitors and a tank for firefighting foam. Onboard 
spill response equipment includes 183m of 
containment boom and absorbent materials.
Deck gear includes a 1.27tonne-capacity Rapp 
Marine hose-handling crane that can also be used 
for skiff and boom deployment or to assist in 
skimming operations.  The vessel can be used as 
floating storage during skimming and recovery.  
Additional onboard emergency safety and rescue 
equipment includes a Jason's Cradle man-
overboard rescue system. 
Crew accommodations include a spacious 
galley and quarters for four.  All black and grey 
water is plumbed into a holding tank which can 
only be pumped ashore.

elivered to Förde Reederei Seetouristik 
(FRS) of Germany in April 2018, the high-
speed catamaran Halunder Jet (aka Austal Hull 
418), or ‘Passenger Express 56’, represents a new 
concept from Austal’s Australia-based design 
team. Innovative, notable features include an 
optimised hull form that has been designed to 
minimise both fuel consumption and wake wash. 
Constructed at Austal’s Philippines shipyard in 
a timeframe of just 12 months, the all-aluminium 
catamaran can travel at speeds of up to 38knots, 
powered by four MTU 16V4000M63L engines, 
ZF 7650 NR2H gearboxes and a quartet of Rolls-
Royce Kamewa S71-4 waterjets. 
The diesel engines were selected to meet IMO’s 
Tier II emissions standards. In addition to catalytic 
converters that remove NOx from the main engine 
exhausts, other environmentally friendly features 
of the catamaran include a silicon-type anti-
fouling (with no biocides that can harm waterways) 
and engine exhaust arrangements with catalytic 
converters that remove nitrous oxides from the 
main engine exhaust.
Halunder Jet also features Austal’s proprietary 
Motion Control System, comprising T-foils 
forward on each hull and interceptors aft. This 
arrangement is intended to provide an enhanced 
ride, featuring less motion and greater passenger 
and crew comfort for every journey, across 
various sea states.
The vessel can carry 680 passengers in three 
classes of comfort across two decks: featuring 
wider, reclining seats with more legroom, 
tables and individual USB ports that allow 
mobile device charging, overhead storage 
compartments (similar to aircraft lockers) and 
an advanced LED lighting system that can be 
programmed to change subtly and gently, 
according to the vessel’s GPS location, time of 
day, ambient light, required mood or for an 
event or special occasion.
The passenger saloons also feature: wheelchair 
access between decks, by way of an elevator; 
kiosks and bars; multiple flat-screen televisions 
for on board ‘infotainment’; and a powerful, 
individually controlled, four-zone air-
conditioning system. Large, panoramic 
windows have been included, to enhance the 
passenger experience by offering unsurpassed 
views from all public areas of the vessel, while a 
central atrium delivers sunlight into the 
passenger saloons. External sundecks, including 
a VIP balcony, meanwhile, allow passengers to 
enjoy fresh air during their journey from 
Hamburg to Helgoland.

U
sing one of its own established Wildcat 
60/18m catamaran designs, Safehaven 
Marine developed HMS Magpie in a contract to 
supply the largest vessel in the UK Ministry of 
Defence’s ‘Sea Class’ VAHANA programme for 
38 boats, awarded to prime contractor Atlas 
Elektronik (AEUK). 
An important stipulation was that the boat 
was able to meet the RN’s requirement for a 
boat capable of maintaining 20knots in sea 
state 4 with 2.5m seas. After acceptance in 
Ireland, she was sailed to Portsmouth where 
AEUK fitted her hydrographic equipment and 
coordinated handover to the RN’s Devonport-
based hydrographic squadron. As such, the 
twin-hulled vessel represents a substantial 
commitment to the modernisation of the RN’s 
inshore survey and underwater surveillance 
capabilities, replacing the 1984-built survey 
boat HMS Gleaner. 
HMS Magpie’s catamaran hull form employs a 
‘high buoyancy’ bow form, enabling her to 
operate in quite extreme sea states without 
slamming occurring on her bridge deck. Her 
superstructure is part-modular, to allow rapid 
re-rolling for varying operational roles, and has 
been developed in what Safehaven calls an 
‘island configuration’, featuring ample safe 
passage and working space all around the deck. 
The bridge deck has also been raised to grant the 
helmsman and navigator optimal visibility and 
awareness of their surroundings when 
undertaking close-quarters manoeuvring and 
navigating through tight spots. 
Accommodation has been organised to allow up 
to nine crew members to sleep below decks, 
spread across two cabins. HMS Magpie also 
features a large galley, providing her crew with 
the ability to cater for themselves during extended 
operations. Two separated heads compartments 
with shower facilities are provided and, for 
additional crew comfort, 43,000btu of air-con has 
been provided. KPM supplied the vessel’s shock-
mitigating seating, to protect her crew from 
injuries, and the main cabin is fitted with a large 
dinette area: this is open to her ‘work space’ 
module, which comes equipped with 
hydrographic equipment and work benches for 
six operatives. The vessel has also been fitted with 
a high-resolution shallow-water multibeam 
echosounder and a side scan sonar. 
To assist her in lifting equipment, cargo and 
parts on and off board, a Palfinger PK6500 crane 
has been installed on her aft deck. This section 
of the vessel also incorporates a deck winch, 
enabling the vessel to deploy and tow sonar 
equipment and to launch remotely operated 
vehicles (ROVs) – for tasks such as mine and 
subsurface obstacle detection, for example.

n January 2017, Wang Tak delivered the eye-
catching, 199-pax ferry Shi Zi Yang 7 for 
Dongguan Humen Longwei Passenger Ferry Co. 
(see Significant Small Ships of 2016, pages 60-61). 
Following that handover, Wang Tak teamed up 
again with co-designers Incat Crowther of 
Australia and Guangdong Hongshen of China to 
develop a new, improved version of this vessel – 
the result being the 40m loa Jiang Men, which 
was turned around in a period of 15 months. 
Jiang Men was ordered to replace an ageing 
ferry asset that had originally been built in 
Australia, and has adopted the outgoing vessel’s 
China-Hong Kong service route. Design 
considerations for the newbuild have included 
spacious interiors, a high level of furnishing, 
comfortable seating and a relatively quiet 
environment for her passenger complement. 
She comprises a two-deck ferry: the main 
deck is outfitted to seat 162 persons, with the 
seating arranged in a 2 × 3 × 3 × 2 formation 
abreast of the vessel, and features wide 
passageways. A service kiosk is located aft, as 
are the crew’s rest facilities – the latter well 
hidden from view of the passengers. 
Meanwhile, the upper deck offers 28 
‘executive-class’, extra-wide double seats 
featuring leather upholstery. Toilet facilities are 
located on both decks. 
Jiang Men was designed with a ‘raked forward’ 
wheelhouse, primarily to protect the crew from 
sun glare and to maximise this zone’s internal 
space. The wheelhouse provides seating for the 
captain and first mate and houses the engineer’s 
station and night navigation station. A special 
maintenance space is located beneath the 
wheelhouse console, for easy access to all 
wheelhouse equipment. The vessel’s hull design 
was also tweaked, with the aim of further 
reducing overall fuel consumption.

ecember 2018 saw UK builder Blyth 
Catamarans deliver an 18.5m loa survey 
vessel to the Department of Biosciences at 
Swansea University. Christened Mary Anning, 
after the nineteenth century English fossil hunter 
and palaeontologist, the £1.3 million (US$1.66 
million) vessel will primarily be used to conduct 
local water and wildlife studies and to undertake 
coastal survey and mapping work. 
Mary Anning features an overall beam of 6m, 
draws 1.3m, displaces 32tonnes and has been 
coded by the UK Maritime & Coastguard 
Agency (MCA) to accommodate up to 26 
‘passengers’. The vessel has been developed 
with 61m² of deck space, strengthened to 
1.5tonnes per m² and complemented by a Pesci 
crane, rated 2.46tonnes SWL at 4.25m, and four 
Hardy winches, rated 2tonnes apiece. 
Onboard facilities for her scientist/student 
complement include a wet lab with stainless 
steel benches and clean water on tap. Two 
cabins are present: the fore cabin features a 
large dinette and mess and is primarily 
provided for the crew’s relaxation; the mid 
cabin, meanwhile, houses the scientific 
computers with a station for two scientists. 
Blyth Catamarans adds: “All data outputs can 
be viewed on large screens throughout the 
vessel, including the aft deck.” The 
accommodation area is situated below deck in 
the form of two triple cabins, and this section 
also contains a workshop area. 
The vessel carries an impressive array of 
equipment, including: two trawl winches; a moon 
pool with multi-beam deployment, which can 
house a Kongsberg M3 sonar; a 2tonne hydraulic 
A frame; a diver lift; a pot hauler to the foredeck; 
two further hydraulic winches; a bow fender for 
turbine transfers; and a raised helm, providing 
360degs visibility and featuring a marine mammal 
observation platform directly above. 
Mary Anning was constructed using Lloyd’s 
Register rules for a G2A operation and has 
been dual-coded for both Cat II and MCA 
Passenger Class VI rules.

M
ed XXIV was the first unit to be delivered in 
a six-vessel series, designed by Robert Allan 
Limited (RAL) exclusively for Med Marine and 
designated RAmparts 2300-MM tugboats. These 
ASD-type vessels are designed for harbour and 
terminal operations, as well as coastal towing. 
For each unit, a pair of Caterpillar 3512C 
diesel engines delivers a total output of 2 × 1,380 
bkW at 1,600 rpm with a free sailing speed of 
12knots and bollard pull of 50tonnes. Two 
Caterpillar C4.4 gensets provide 86kWe of 
electrical power apiece for vessel services, 
including the deck machinery. 
Each vessel drives two Schottel SRP340 
azimuthing thrusters with fixed-pitch propellers 
of 2,100mm diameter. The diesel-driven fire-
fighting (FiFi) pump for the tug’s FiFi E system is 
mounted on one of the main engines and can 
deliver 1,400m³ per hour to two electrically 
controlled monitors. 
The RAmparts 2300-MM tugs are compliant 
with the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) 
with 
high-quality 
and 
high-comfort 
accommodation, including a captain’s cabin, an 
officer cabin and two double crew cabins. 
Optional items of equipment for this series 
include: an electric frequency-controlled aft towing 
winch; a Toimil T-10500M deck crane, rated 1tonne 
at 8m; two main fire pumps with a total capacity of 
2,800m³ per hour and two FFS  foam/water 
monitors; HVAC hot and cold climate packages; and 
a hydraulic rescue boat crane, with an SWL of 12kN.

A 
combination of R&D and feedback from 
military and professional end users is 
credited with influencing the development of 
Norsafe’s new Munin S1200 Open model – 
which, as its name suggests, offers an open-deck 
variant on the company’s existing Munin S1200 
closed cockpit design. 
As with past Norsafe Munin models, the new 
boat is designed for optimal manoeuvrability and 
with low freeboards, to assist with search and 
rescue (SAR) missions such as recovering 
casualties from the water, for example. An 
additional influence on design has been the open 
RIB-D / RHIB-D concept, with its stepped, 
balanced hull, which was most recently 
incorporated into Norsafe’s Marathon 900 
RHIB-D class.  
The symmetrical nature of the Munin S1200 
Open’s cockpit layout for three crew members, 
meanwhile, was influenced by the arrangement 
aboard Norsafe’s Magnum 850 class. The 
ergonomically designed helm and seats are intended 
to offer maximum comfort to the crew, while the 
boat’s rigid construction was formulated to curb 
excessive noise and slamming. The one-level deck is 
step-free, to decrease the likelihood of trips and 
falls, and anti-skid surfaces have been added to all 
walking areas for additional personnel protection. 
As well as SAR service providers, Norsafe 
describes the typical Munin S1200 operator as 
being employed in the “special forces, coast 
guard, law enforcement, aqua-farming and/or 
offshore” sectors. 
Overall, Norsafe continues, the Munin S1200 
Open is intended to enable users to “take 
advantage of the high-performance credentials 
developed with the Munin S1200 closed cockpit” 
concept. The vessel features a 24degs transom 
double stepped hull, for optimal manoeuvrability 
at high speed. 
The prototype version of the Munin S1200 
Open is powered by three 298kW Mercury 
Verado outboards. Norsafe claims that its 
decision to opt for these engine types was “based 
on market demand and internal feedback”, 
though customers will be able to order versions 
of this class with twin waterjets, twin stern 
drives and twin surface drives, if so desired. The 
triple-Mercury Verado arrangement is sufficient 
to help the boat to achieve a top speed of 
65knots, Norsafe calculates. 
In order to further assist the Munin S1200 
Open’s capability for fast navigation, the boat 
type was constructed from composites. Norsafe 
explains: “The high speed of the vessel is 
achieved by using light materials like advanced 
laminates: multiaxial glass fibre mats, sandwich 
foam construction, vinylester and the use of 
vacuum infusion as a method of composites 
production.”  A foam stiffener system infused in 
the hull lamination together with the liner 
makes up the boat’s hull structure. “High-
performance glue has been used to adhere the 
liner to the hull, with no wood being used in the 
construction,” Norsafe adds. 
The top part of the boat’s bimini has been 
constructed in fibre and vinylester, using vacuum 
infusion, while the sunroof structure has been 
fashioned from marine grade aluminium, with an 
optional GRP hard-top roof. 
Other onboard features include: eight 
stainless steel mooring cleats; a locker for 
chains and ropes; water gussets, situated on 
both sides of the aft end of the cockpit; cargo 
rails, enabling crew to fix seats, storage boxes 
and other items of cargo or equipment on the 
deck; and VHF, loudhailer and intercom 
capabilities. And, for what it’s worth, having 
trialled the vessel at 50knots+ at Seawork 2018 
in Southampton, your humble editor can attest 
it’s one of the smoothest high-speed patrol boat 
rides he’s been on to date.

A 
partnership between high-speed boat designer 
Norson Design and German boatbuilder and 
aluminium specialist Ophardt Maritim has 
resulted in a series of multi-sized, customisable 
RIBs balancing high-speed efficiency with low-
weight, comfortable running. The Ophardt 
Precision Hull (OPH)/969/D is the 9.7m version of 
this series, which spans a size range of 7-12m, and 
which is capable of top speeds surpassing 60knots 
(the ‘D’ denotes the incorporation of D-ring 
fendering). All RIBs in the series can be customised 
to suit specific end user requirements/missions, 
and are predominantly aimed at a professional 
user base, with intended applications varying from 
special operations to general patrol duties. 
According to Norson Design: “Various proven 
and unique high-speed hull features which do 
not compromise seakeeping were successfully 
implemented, and are achieving better than 
expected results.” The designer’s aim was to 
develop an aluminium-fashioned hull capable of 
the same tolerances as – or superior tolerances 
to – a fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) hull. 
These RIBs’ hulls were built using Ophardt’s 
pre-stiffened system, in which the panels are 
CNC-cut and CNC-formed to their designed 
shapes and then positioned onto each vessel’s 
‘chassis’. As Norson puts it: “Using a base jig set 
to exceptionally high tolerances, the panels’ 
seams are then robotically welded in perfect 
symmetry to eradicate warping. The final 
product is a hull with perfect geometry, which is 
vital in high-speed applications.” Most of the 
RIBS’ other components – such as engine offset 
plates and handgrips– have also  been fabricated 
using Ophardt’s in-house CNC machinery. 
This approach has yielded numerous benefits, 
including significant weight savings and 
increased plate thicknesses. These hulls also 
have dual-performance ability, combining 
high-speed running and stability with 
enhanced cornering and good overall 
seakeeping performance. The hull forms have 
enabled a generous beam, permitting increased 
passenger numbers and payloads, as well as 
offering a decent amount of walk-around space. 
Ophardt has also factored high degrees of 
ergonomics and comfort into these RIBs’ 
layouts, as the designer explains: “The unique 
console and steering adjustability give drivers 
and passengers the ability to position 
themselves according to their stature and 
preferred riding position.”

A
lthough the main purpose of the 19.9m loa 
Pacifico Voyager – the debut model in 
Albatross Marine Design’s (AMD’s) PV199 class – 
is to serve as an expedition yacht on the far east 
side of Russia, this vessel has been designed with a 
high degree of flexibility, enabling it to be utilised 
alternatively as a tour vessel, a dive support 
platform and even, potentially, a research vessel. 
Deploying a catamaran hull form, the vessel 
has been built in composite, specifically high-
strength carbon fibre, and was created using 
the vacuum infusion process, courtesy of 
Russian specialist Composite Shipbuilding. 
High-tech composites were selected as they 
would not lead to significant weight gain, 
especially given the craft’s high superstructure. 
All of the components used to produce the hull 
structure were sourced domestically, making 
Pacifico Voyager a purely Russian vessel in 
terms of physicality. 
The boat is capable of carrying three tenders 
and/or jet skis on the stern platforms and on 
the transom. Given the treacherous weather 
and temperatures that this PV199 can expect to 
encounter on its travels, the vessel has also 
been equipped with a sauna for the owner and 
his guests. 
AMD recalls: “As the Small Craft Inspectorate 
of Russia limits the length of ‘small craft’ to be 
below 20m, the decision was made to make a 
wide, multi-deck catamaran with a maximum 
length of 19.9m. As a result, the craft is 
extremely spacious.”

018 saw battery power adopted by a wide range 
of vessel types, from fishing boats and fast 
ferries to offshore support vessels. Joining this user 
base was the Estonian Police and Border Guard 
Board, which took delivery of the 44.6m 
multipurpose patrol vessel Raju in August – 
reportedly its first battery-fuelled hybrid vessel. 
The 445gt vessel also constitutes the largest patrol 
boat that Baltic Workboats has constructed to date, 
and the first in its range of electric patrol vessels. 
The craft was designed and built with a wave-
piercing hull, to grant optimal stability and safety 
for the benefit of the crew. The Patrol 45 Hybrid 
class vessel is also equipped with state-of-the-art 
technology to assist her in fulfilling search and 
rescue (SAR), surveillance, firefighting, oil 
recovery, buoy tendering and transport duties. 
The hybrid propulsion plant provides a top speed 
of 27knots whilst enabling an economic cruising 
speed of 10-12knots with a range of 3,000nm. Raju’s 
fully integrated electrical and energy storage system 
enables the crew to run the vessel in pure-electric 
mode for a speed of 12knots. In the event of a SAR 
or special operation, Raju can deploy a 7m workboat 
and a RescueRunner, the latter being the jet ski-like 
SAR craft manufactured by Sweden’s Safe At Sea. 
Raju was designed to accommodate a crew of 
10, although up to 18 persons can be 
accommodated on board when a larger crew is 
required for longer missions, Baltic Workboats 
states. The company adds: “Stabilising fins and an 
anti-heeling tank are installed to reduce anti-
rolling effect and increase the ship’s seakeeping 
capability.” For even further advanced mission 
control, the boat is also equipped with a dynamic 
positioning system and oil spill detection radar. 
As a further concession to crew comfort, noise 
levels have been restricted to below 60dB in  
the wheelhouse when the vessel is travelling at 
full speed.

B
uilt in East Cowes by Wight Shipyard Co. 
(WSC), Red Jet 7 represents an investment of 
£7 million (US8.9 million) by Red Funnel in its 
route between Southampton, on the UK 
mainland, and West Cowes, on the Isle of Wight. 
The contract was scooped by WSC following the 
yard’s completion of the 2016-delivered sister 
vessel Red Jet 6 (see Significant Small Ships of 
2016, pages 54-55) – a task that was credited with 
reviving the aluminium fast ferry construction 
business on the Isle of Wight after a gap of 
approximately 15 years.
Red Jet 7, which replaces Red Jet 3, is the first in 
Red Funnel’s Red Jet series to be designed with 
the ability to operate outside the Solent. She is 
also hailed as the greenest ‘Red Jet’ in the fleet: for 
instance, she weighs some 4tonnes less than Red 
Jet 6 and thus offers reduced fuel consumption 
and emissions, reduced wash and enhanced 
manoeuvrability. She also meets MARPOL IMO 
Tier II engine emission standards and uses vinyl 
instead of paint to both reduce weight and limit 
her output of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
into the environment. Teflon hull coatings help to 
minimise drag, thus also reducing her rates of 
fuel consumption. 
On a commercial level, however, the 
newcomer also offers 51% more seats than the 
outgoing Red Jet 3, as does Red Jet 6. Also like 
her sister, Red Jet 7 uses waterjets rather than 
propellers to enhance manoeuvrability during 
operations, plus to provide a high degree of 
stopping power. WSC says: “An advanced hull 
design and computer-controlled interceptors 
also help keep the wash to an absolute 
minimum, which is good news for leisure craft 
in the area.” Her propulsive set-up sees four 
MTU main engines powering quad Hamilton 
HM571 waterjet units. “This configuration will 
ensure high levels of in-service availability as 
she can operate on two or three engines if any 
waterjet intakes become obstructed by debris in 
the Solent,” WSC adds. 
For passenger comfort, all 275 seats are built 
in leather and feature cup-holders. There is also 
space for four wheelchairs, and the unisex 
toilets are wheelchair-friendly. Other features 
include: free WiFi; tinted windows, to reduce 
glare; automatically controlled cabin air 
temperature and humidity; and six LED HD 
TV screens, offering a selection of local and 
national news headlines, as well as weather and 
travel connection updates. These screens can 
also display Red Jet 7’s GPS position along the 
route plus live video feed from external 
cameras, positioned forward and aft.

A 
vessel capable of conducting its tasks “safely, 
smoothly and sustainably” was the remit for 
the Port of Rotterdam Authority’s January-
delivered patrol boat, RPA 8. The aluminium 
boat was designed to operate at high speeds while 
reducing fuel consumption and producing a 
minimal quantity of emissions. 
However, that was not the only consideration: 
RPA  8’s duties involve negotiating a network of 
rivers, canals and inland waterways home to 
houseboats, commercial barges and pleasure boats, 
and so an eye had to be kept on the amount of waves 
generated by RPA 8. The Port of Rotterdam specified 
a maximum generated wave of 400mm at 30m from 
the boat at a speed of 20km/h (approximately 
10.8knots). In response, RPA 8 was able to supersede 
this requirement by limiting its wave height at this 
distance and speed to just 290mm. 
The boat incorporates the Fast Displacement 
Hull Form (FDHF) developed by Van Oossanen, 
and is fitted with a Hull Vane, a transom-mounted 
hydrofoil developed by the company of the same 
name (and also a subsidiary of Van Oossanen). 
This hydrofoil converts the waste energy of the 
stern wave into upward lift and forward thrust 
(for a full analysis, see Ship & Boat International 
November/December 2017, pages 44-46). The 
FDHF concept, meanwhile, is intended to reduce 
hydrodynamic resistance across a wider speed 
range than is possible for a  vessel with a round 
bilge displacement hull. 
Kooiman says: “Compared to the latest 
newbuild patrol vessels in the port’s fleet, built 
about 15 years ago, RPA 8 has only 60% of the 
installed power [2 × 382kW versus 2 × 634kW 
engines]. This is due to a combination of a 
longer ship length [25m instead of 21.4m], an 
efficient hull shape and the Hull Vane [which 
saves 22% at the top speed]. As most of the 
sailing takes place at 20km/h, where the 
difference in fuel consumption is larger than at 
its top speed of 35km/h, RPA 8 will consume 
roughly half the fuel of the other patrol vessels 
to do the same job.”
The propulsion system was developed in 
collaboration with Hybrid Ship Propulsion 
(HSP). Kooiman elaborates: “With the so-called 
‘parallel hybrid operation system’, the two 
installed propulsion trains can take over each 
other’s operation electrically.” Should only one 
of the two power trains be active, the diesel 
engine of the inactive unit can be switched off. 
The active power train will then drive both 
propellers: the first one directly and the second 
one electrically. “The low emissions that are 
associated with this operation system, in 
combination with the effects of the applied 
exhaust after-treatment, result in emission levels 
that meet Stage V requirements with ample 
margin,” Kooiman adds.
In the early stages of RPA 8’s development, an 
ergonomics study was conducted by ErgoS 
Human Factors Engineering, involving input 
from future users of the boat and the creation of a 
complete wooden mock-up. Drawing on 
technology common in the superyacht sector, 
Kooiman was able to curb noise and vibration 
levels. For instance, the entire deckhouse is 
mounted on three pneumatic bellows from 
Rubber Design, which led to noise levels being 
restricted to 49dB(A) in the wheelhouse while 
operating at 19knots.

T
he 28.4m × 8.5m R/V Virginia was ordered 
to perform oceanographic research in 
Chesapeake Bay and mid-Atlantic coastal 
waters, and offers flexibility in outfitting, 
allowing for high utilisation and affordable day 
rates. The vessel has also been designed to easily 
adapt to evolving scientific research areas such 
as 
wind 
energy 
development 
surveys, 
environmental impact studies, sediment studies 
and the servicing of ocean observing systems.
Two Cummins QSK 19M engines have been 
coupled to a Finnoy 2G27-42FK two–in/one-out 
marine gear driving a Finnoy controllable-pitch 
propeller. The propeller turns inside of a Rice 
thrust nozzle with triple Rice rudders for 
steering. This arrangement means the vessel can 
operate efficiently on a single propulsion engine 
when on station or during low-speed transits, to 
reduce overall engine hours and emissions. 
The gearbox also powers a robust hydraulic 
system via two independently clutched PTOs, 
to support the suite of deepwater trawl winches 
and bow thruster. Two Kohler generators 
provide redundant capability or can be run in 
parallel during peak power demands.
A Veth pump jet omnidirectional flush-
mounted grid bow thruster, in combination 
with the controllable-pitch propeller and triple 
rudders, enhances manoeuvrability, which is 
further enhanced by a state-of-the-art Beier 
Radio IVCS 4000 dynamic positioning system 
for station-keeping.
The vessel makes use of a beam of 8.53m, a 
relatively low vertical centre of gravity and 
underwater hull form attributes – including the 
propeller nozzle, triple rudders, twin skegs 
mounted outboard and the single chine hull 
form – to provide high initial stability and 
significant roll dampening to impart stability 
characteristics of a larger vessel. Measures were 
also taken to ensure an acoustically acceptable 
onboard working environment. The propulsion 
engines and generators and their respective 
exhaust systems are resiliently mounted and 
acoustic material treatments throughout the 
vessel minimise noise and vibration levels.
Oceanographic outfitting includes large wet 
and dry labs designed for maximum flexibility, 
to accommodate the many types of scientific 
research the vessel is expected to conduct. The 
main working deck allows for a 20 long tonne 
science payload and provides a working 
platform for fishing operations, over-the-side 
sampling and coring activities. There is also 
ample room and services to install a 20ft (6.1m) 
van for specialised scientific missions. 
The aft deck has a stern A-Frame with a 
3.63tonne SWL for over-the-stern lifting 
operations and a side-mounted J-Frame with a 
1.8tonne SWL for conducting CTD operations. 
Hawboldt

T
he dual-purpose vessel Scotia represents an 
interesting mix of pilot vessel and harbour 
workboat, and a valuable addition to the 
Scottish ports of Ayr and Troon. 
The contract to build the vessel was won by 
Macduff Shipyards, while Macduff Ship Design 
produced the full ship design and steel kit to 
the strict requirements specified by owner 
Associated British Ports (ABP). As Macduff 
Ship Design recalls: “We’d produced a number 
of such vessels in the past for harbours where 
only one vessel is stationed but there is a need 
for a multi-role vessel to assist berthing and 
conduct pilot duties. Scotia was, however, 
unusual in that it was to be firstly tailored to 
pilot duties with a workboat capability, rather 
than a more conventional tug-style vessel.” 
Given its role as the primary vessel for the 
Port of Ayr, it was vital that Scotia not only 
performed full pilot duties but also had the 
capability to assist vessels when entering the 
port.  With these varying requirements the 
vessel needed to be suitably robust for general 
harbour duties whilst maintaining strict 
weight management. 
Scotia is designed to carry two crew members 
and two pilots and operate between the ports of 
Ayr and Troon and the Scottish West Coast.  The 
vessel is classed to Maritime and Coastguard 
Agency (MCA) Workboat Code regulations and 
surveyed by SCMS.  The propulsive arrangement 
includes two John Deere 6068SFM85 engines, 
rated 239.4kW at 2,600rpm, coupled to ZF 305-
3A gearboxes with 2.423:1 ratio – all supplied by 
E.P.Barrus.  The vessel carries 4,000litres of fuel.
The hull form was based on a previous 
successful semi-displacement hull form 
developed by Macduff Ship Design for use in 
similar operations.  This was tailored in the 
final design stages to optimise performance 
and seakeeping whilst maintaining its workboat 
capabilities. Macduff Ship Design provided full 
construction and outfitting drawings to 
Macduff Shipyards, who completed the vessel 
on schedule with delivery to the Port of Ayr 
slightly ahead of contract.
Resultant sea trials gave an improvement on 
both the predicted speed, with Scotia reaching 
12.2knots at 100% MCR, and bollard pull, with 
the vessel achieving a rating of 5.2tonnes.

A
s her designer ESNA put it at the time, the 
July 2018-launched offshore wind farm 
support vessel Sea Puffin 1 is aptly named: like 
her wildlife namesake, her planned lifespan 
will primarily be spent away from shore, in 
open-sea conditions. 
The vessel has adopted a surface effect ship (SES) 
design, which combines catamaran hulls with 
hovercraft technology, deploying a fibre-reinforced 
rubber bag between the hulls. When a lift fan blows 
air into this enclosed space, an air cushion is created, 
which can lift up to 80% of the vessel’s weight. The 
other 20% is supported by side hull buoyance. 
The claimed advantage of this concept is the 
ability to significantly dampen wave-induced 
motions and realise high speeds without 
corresponding demand on fuel. ESNA explains: “A 
computer-based control system actively controls the 
air cushion pressure. This is done by operating 
louvers [or slats] that can ventilate air out from the 
air cushion or shut off air supply from the lift fan. By 
manipulating the air pressure, the control system 
reduces the vertical motions of the entire vessel.”  
The air cushion lift fan is powered by a dedicated 
Steyr diesel engine, mounted on the main deck. 
Sea Puffin 1 has been designed to be operated 
as a daughter craft, deployable by an offshore 
mothership or platform, to facilitate in-wind 
farm distribution of technician and equipment. 
However, given the vessel’s fuel-efficient 
qualities, it can also be used as a low-opex, near-
shore crew transfer vessel.  
ESNA adds: “Using air-cushioned motion 
damping while pushing onto offshore wind 
turbines, she can safely transfer personnel and 
cargo to the turbines in wave heights typically 
only handled by significantly larger vessels.” 
This grants the operator a much wider weather 
window than would typically be the case with 
conventional daughter craft of this size, and 
reduces the need to rely on additional support 
vessels for back-up. 
The SES has been built with 5083 and 6082 
aluminium alloy. For launch and recovery to the 
mothership, Sea Puffin 1 is fitted with an off-
load single-hook and painter line system, which 
can be operated via a standard davit or other 
lifting cranes. The deckhouse includes a 
wheelhouse for two crew and nine turbine 
technicians, while an exterior recess provides 
sheltered access to the single hook system.

easuring 45m in length and boasting the 
capacity for 600 passengers, Seastreak 
Commodore has been heralded as the 
highest‑capacity US Coast Guard K-classed 
fast ferry built to date, and has provided a 
welcome boost to Seastreak’s passenger 
services – both within New York City (NYC), 
where she is currently servicing a number of 
commuter routes, and in undertaking open-
sea, weekend excursions to Martha’s Vineyard 
and Nantucket. The latter service is believed to 
be one of the longest high-speed ferry runs in 
the US, if not the longest. 
This operational flexibility has led James 
Barker, president of Seastreak, to comment: 
“She…performs exceptionally well in both 
applications…there are no other ferries in NYC 
which have the level of comfort, speed and size 
of Seastreak Commodore.” To achieve these 
plaudits, designer Incat Crowther worked 
closely with the operator while maintaining a 
focus on the ferry’s operational environment. 
For example, Seastreak Commodore’s boarding 
arrangement – which includes large side gates 
positioned forward and aft – was designed to align 
with existing shore-based infrastructure, while the 
ferry’s adjustable bow ramp was produced to 
facilitate fast passenger turnarounds at the wharves 
on her Big Apple route. These considerations mark 
a step change from the fleet’s previous large ferries, 
namely Seastreak Wall Street, Seastreak New Jersey, 
Seastreak Highlands and Seastreak New York.
The vessel was constructed at Gulf Craft’s 
facility in Louisiana and is powered by four MTU 
engines, all rated to US Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) Tier III requirements. Combined 
with Kamewa waterjets, this arrangement granted 
Seastreak Commodore sea trial speeds in excess of 
38knots at 100% MCR. 
Other features targeting passenger comfort 
include large, plush seats, a faux-hardwood-
patterned carpet and LED lighting.

W
hen developing the ocean tug Sigrid Dunlap, 
naval architect Hockema Whalen Myers 
Associates (HWMA) turned to the past for 
inspiration, drawing on – and “evolving” – the 
design of its 2002-built tug Phyllis Dunlap. HWMA 
concedes that “outwardly, the two boats appear to 
be nearly identical” – although the June 
2018-delivered Sigrid Dunlap has been refined to 
incorporate current technologies into her 
arrangement, leading to enhancements related to 
onboard comfort, equipment and environmental 
compliance. 
The tug’s primary role involves towing 
container barges from Seattle to Honolulu on a 
scheduled service for Alaska Marine Lines. The 
vessel is ABS- and SOLAS-classed, with an 
ABCU endorsement for unattended machinery 
room operation. HWMA adds: “Redundant 
controls and monitoring equipment ensure the 
most automated, reliable platform possible.” 
Sigrid Dunlap is equipped with twin Caterpillar 
C175-16 engines turning at 1,600rpm: these were 
selected to meet Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) Tier 3 and IMO Tier II standards. 
Reintjes WAF1173 gears provide the reduction to 
3,048mm, three-bladed propellers fitted in 
Nautican triple rudder Integrated Propulsion 
Units and incorporating Jastram independent 
steering controls. Engine controls and shaft 
brakes were provided by Propulsion Systems, Inc. 
A fuel capacity of just over 557,000litres provides 
ample range for trans-Pacific crossings.
The deck area is fitted with a large double-drum 
Markey TDSDS-36 tow winch on the aft deck and 
an electric Markey DESW 32-20 hawser winch 
with anchor windlass on the bow. The tow pin 
unit was provided by McEvoy Machine.
Inside, Sigrid Dunlap offers three single 
staterooms and four double cabins, all with 
individual Dometic climate controls for crew 
comfort. The boat is insulated with structural 
fire insulation plus sound insulation and 
includes a double-layer Norac floating floor 
system over the engine room to keep vibrations 
to a minimum – meaning that, while she has the 
clout to venture across the Pacific, she can also 
guarantee a relatively pleasant experience for 
crew while doing so.

esigned by Incat Crowther, Spirit of the Wild 
has been credited as the first tour vessel in 
Australia to operate in the World Heritage-listed 
wilderness in what Incat describes as ‘Silent 
Drive’ propulsive mode – a mode which 
guarantees sound levels as low as 45dBA. 
The vessel’s tours take it into territory 
recognised as a UNESCO Tasmanian Wilderness 
World Heritage Area. Incat Crowther elaborates: 
“In open water, the vessel will use ‘Boost’ mode, 
drawing on the hybrid system, which matches 
motor speed to engine speed to seamlessly add 
electric power.” In this mode, the boat is capable 
of a service speed of 25knots. The designer 
continues: “When the tour comes to the World 
Heritage-listed Gordon River, Silent Drive mode 
is engaged. In this mode, the main engines are 
shut down and the vessel runs on electric power.” 
Spirit of the Wild incorporates a pair of MTU 
10V2000M72 main engines, working in 
conjunction with a hybrid electric system, 
comprising two ABB electric motors driving 
hybrid-ready ZF gearboxes. The engines and 
gears were mounted so as to reduce transmission 
of noise and vibrations, while the engine 
ventilation systems and engine room have been 
bolstered by a fully engineered acoustic insulation 
system. Fittings and door openings were also 
analysed, and seals and bushes were used to 
prevent rattles and gaps, thus also helping the 
vessel to keep sound levels down. 
The boat incorporates a triangular side 
structure to enlarge openings and minimise 
obstructed viewing locations, for the benefit of 
tourists. Incat Crowther adds: “Dark reflective 
floor-to-ceiling glass provides an unparalleled 
viewing experience and enables the vessel to 
‘disappear’ into a backdrop of tannin-coloured 
water and ancient wilderness forest.” 
Meanwhile, for the benefit of her crew, the 
vessel’s service areas are located in the centre of 
the vessel while the main deck side boarding 
areas, involving engine room ventilation and 
engine removal, were minimised. The main 
staircase is open, to avoid obstruction. The 
galley and servery are linked by a dumb waiter, 
with the layout and function of the catering 
spaces attended to by a commercial food and 
beverage consultant. Interior features include the 
use of a stretched membrane ceiling in the upper 
deck, while visibility is guarded by integrated 
de-misting and exterior washing systems.

S
trait Sentinel was built to the specifications of 
Robert Allan Ltd’s (RAL’s) BRAvo 2500 
pollution response vessel class, designed to protect 
Canada’s West Coast from the effects of oil spills. 
Constructed in Singapore by ASL Shipyards, the 
twin-screw vessel was delivered to the Western 
Canada Marine Response Corporation (WCMRC) 
as the first of three BRAvo 2500 newbuilds, in line 
with the WCMRC’s strategy of beefing up its 
offshore spill response capability – especially for 
the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. 
RAL worked closely alongside WCMRC to develop 
the custom-designed vessels to operate within 
their specific environment. 
As well as serving as a response vessel, Strait Sentinel 
is designed to act as a mothership to other smaller 
vessels during oil spill clean-up operations and/or 
during training exercises. Following CFD analysis, 
RAL designed the vessel with a bulbous bow and opted 
for resiliently mounted, EPA Tier 3-compliant 
Caterpillar C9.3 main engines – an arrangement 
yielding a speed of approximately 10knots. Deck 
machinery and onboard services, meanwhile, are fed 
by a pair of Caterpillar C4.4 gensets. 
The aft deck is equipped with 762m of Kepner self-
inflating offshore containment boom, which is 
stored on a large powered reel. The vessel also carries 
a NOFI Current Buster 4 sweep system, which it can 
tow to capture oil. The booms can be deployed over 
an aft roller, to minimise wear during training 
exercises. An aft swim platform facilitates launch 
and recovery of equipment, using the boat’s Palfinger 
crane, while crew can stow loose spill response 
equipment in a series of lockers on the main deck. A 
large wet gear entry space has been factored into the 
layout, in recognition of the west coast’s wet climate. 
The entry space can be used as an internal 
decontamination area in the event of a spill. 
As well as being wet, Canada’s West Coast is prone 
to harsh weather and rough waves, and so RAL also 
paid attention to limiting the vessel’s motion in 
waves. Consequently, RAL implemented its hull 
sponson technology, as featured on the designer’s 
wide range of RAstar offshore escort tugs, into 
Strait Sentinel’s set-up – in addition to large bilge 
keels and twin skegs. The designer states: “The 
vessel’s stability was also assessed to optimise rolling 
period and not only satisfy regulatory requirements, 
but also implement [our] recommendation for one 
compartment damage survivability.” 
Lloyd’s Register oversaw classification of 
Strait Sentinel (and indeed all three BRAvo 2500 
units) and the vessel was also developed to conform 
with the requirements of Transport Canada.

U
nithai Chumporn represents the first of a pair 
of 80tonnes bp offshore utility vessels, 
designed by OSD-IMT (formerly Offshore Ship 
Designers) as part of its IMT 7001 class, and built 
in Thailand, at Unithai Shipyard and Engineering, 
for operator Unithai Offshore Ltd. 
As with her forthcoming sister, Unithai Chumporn 
has been tasked with providing a wide range of support 
activities in and around offshore oil fields and oil 
terminals. The vessel was built with the capacity to 
berth oil tankers ranging from 60,000dwt to 
280,000dwt, and will also undertake vital roles such as 
long-line towing/push-pull operations, firefighting 
response, single point mooring (SPM) maintenance 
and floating hose/subsea hose string maintenance. She 
will also be tasked with anchor-handling duties and 
pollution response/control, in addition to more 
straightforward duties, such as transporting equipment 
and supplies between and within fields. 
The near-50m loa vessel has been classed by 
Bureau Veritas and is registered and flagged in 
Thailand, operating under the rules and 
regulations of the Thailand Registry. The power 
configuration includes two Niigata 8L28HX diesel 
engines, coupled to twin Niigata ZP41 azimuth 
propulsion units via a cardan shaft arrangement. 
This has proven sufficient to guarantee Unithai 
Chumporn an ahead bollard pull rating of 80tonnes 
and a free running speed of around 13knots.

elivered to UK operator Wightlink in July 
2018, and representing Wightlink’s largest 
vessel introduced to date, Victoria of Wight 
combines diesel-electrical plant with battery 
technology, thereby enabling her power to be 
matched to her actual needs across the complete 
operating profile. For instance, by utilising 
Corvus Energy’s lithium-ion-based battery 
packs, the ferry’s main gensets can be switched 
off when in port to reduce power drain, 
eliminate exhaust emissions and slash noise 
levels at each end of the route.
This hybrid power arrangement also fulfils 
Wightlink’s specification for enhanced efficiency 
and reduced carbon footprint compared to 
similarly sized ferries. This was to prove a 
significant target, given that Victoria of Wight 
will be undertaking a rather hectic schedule of 
up to 20 crossings per day on the Solent. In 
addition to her 934kWh of combined battery 
power, the vessel has been designed and 
constructed with a number of energy-saving 
features, including  LED lighting, as well as 
waste heat recovery from the engines, which can 
then be used for shipboard heating. 
As an indication of her sheer size, Victoria of Wight 
features 550m
2 of outside passenger decks and 500m
2 
of total lounge space. The ferry deploys a drive-
through configuration and the main vehicle deck 
offers sufficient headroom to accommodate heavy 
goods vehicles and deploys bow and stern ramps. 
The hull is irregular in shape, as Houlder's 
principal naval architect David Wing highlights. 
He says: “Victoria of Wight has a wider breadth 
than the ships for which the berth was designed. 
As a result, the linkspan centreline is offset from 
the ship’s centreline and the offset shape is to 
ensure that her ramps meet the linkspan correctly. 
One side of the ship has a ‘sponson’ type 
arrangement built on to the hull, above the 
waterline, to allow for the ramp offset. This allows 
the underwater shape to be symmetric, which 
helps improve hydrodynamic efficiency and 
prevents the ship ‘crabbing’ at sea.” This “apparent 
elongated, octagonal shape”, as Wing puts it, helps 
ensure that the fenders meet the jaws of the berth 
correctly for secure and timely turnarounds.
