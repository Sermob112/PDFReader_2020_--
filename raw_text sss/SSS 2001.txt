T
HE Chennai Port Trust has proved to be a good
customer for the Cochin Shipyard in India, with
recent orders for dredgers as well as the 45tonne
bollard pull tug Bharathiar. Cochin shipyard is the
largest and most advanced in India, and has built
several tugs in recent years, as well as working on
building and repair of large ships and offshore
units.
The new tug, handed over to the port trust in
August, follows standard Voith Schneider tug design
and build practices, but at 32.9m length overall, and
671tonnes displacement, she is of substantial size,
well able to handle the large vessels using the 
port.
A propulsion plant comprising twin Caterpillar 
6-cylinder medium-speed diesels driving Voith
Schneider 2.8m propulsors develops 3750kW,
giving the required 45tonne maximum bollard 
pull 
and 
a 
free-running 
speed 
of
nearly 
14knots.
The tug may lack the sophistication in equipment
that is found in many other new tugs, but in
countries where labour is relatively inexpensive,
allowing high manning levels to be maintained, there
is far less need for complex automation and control
systems.
Bharathiar operates with a crew of up to 16, a very
high 
complement 
by 
European 
standards.
Nevertheless, high-specification basic equipment is
fitted, including Furuno radar. The electrical needs
of the necessarily large accommodation are filled 
by two 100kW Cummins-powered diesel alternators,
plus a 40kW harbour genset.
A telescopic mast 
type 
fire 
fighting 
unit 
is 
provided 
for 
emergency use.

N May 2001, Astilleros de Pasaia delivered its first
tug - though such vessels are not new to the yard
itself, which, in the 1980s, when the yard operated
under the name Astilleros Luzuriaga, several tugs
and offshore vessels were delivered to Spanish
operators. Two larger tugs, of 28m and 30m, were
subsequently ordered from Pasaia for an Algerian
owner.
Facal Dieciocho was designed by Cintranaval for high-
sea towage and harbour assistance, for operation in
the port of Pasajes de San Pedro on the Spanish
Basque coast, a port of call for a wide variety of ships
with a difficult entrance. The design called for a tug
able to carry out harbour and mooring assistance in
safety but at the same time being simple to operate.
The vessel would also be required to undertake high
sea towage, firefighting and pollution control duties.
Each of the two Caterpillar main engines drives an
Ulstein Aquamaster thruster via a hydraulic clutch, an
intermediate shaftline and a cardan transmission. A
highly elastic Vulkan coupling is installed between
each engine and thruster.
No side thrusters are fitted, but the design allows
for retrofitting should even greater manoevrability be
required in future. With two Itxas Guria winches,
mounted forward and aft, the tug is able to tow in any
direction.
A Kvaerner Eureka firefighting system, with two
water-foam monitors and two water jets installed on
the top of the wheelhouse. The tug is also fitted with
a dispersant dosing pump, salt water pump and
spraying booms for anti-pollution work.

Delivery date:......................................................February 2001
L
ady Laura was delivered by Damen Shipyards of The
Netherlands to Howard Smith Towage in February
2001.
The ship is to Damen's ASD 3111 design,
featuring a round bilge hull with transom stern and
rounded bow. The transom corners are well rounded and
the forecastle gives sufficient bow height for severe
working conditions.
The hull is divided into six
compartments and is of very strong construction, with
side and bottom plating of 12mm and decks of 8mm
thickness.
In the aft ship the bottom plating has a
thickness of 16mm.
The aft deck is suitable for a
specific weight of 3tonnes/m2.
At the sides a rubber D-fender size 300mm x 300mm
is fitted. At the bow a cylindrical top fender of 900mm
diameter is combined with a large W-type fender of
480mm thickness.
At the transom corners, the
fendering consists of a cylindrical fender of 600mm
diameter. The tug is capable of a free heeling angle of
38deg to reduce risk of damage when handling ships.
The total power of 4908bhp is sufficient to give a
bollard pull of 66tonnes and a free running speed of
13.3knots. The design of the hull, which incorporates
a large skeg, allows an astern speed of 12.3knots to be
achieved, at which full steering control is still possible.
Niigata slipping clutches, model CL 202 APY, are fitted
between the main engines and the thruster, which
enable the propeller speed to be controlled very
accurately when the main engines are running at idle.
The azimuth thruster can be removed without docking
the vessel.
Both fore and aft winches have a brake holding
power of 125tonnes. The fore winch, of the double
drum type, is fitted with one warping head and one
cable lifter. The aft winch has one warping head. Both
winches can be controlled either locally or remotely,
from the wheelhouse. The fore winch drums have
separate brakes and clutches for independent control.
Bilge/ballast pumps, fuel pumps and lube oil pumps
are all supplied by Desmi.
A Facet bilge water
separator and Hamworthy sewage treatment plant are
fitted.
All accommodation is sited above the waterline, with
captain and chief engineer cabins in the deckhouse and
two double crew cabins below the forecastle deck. An
office is provided below deck.

S
ERTOSA Treinta, delivered by the Balenciaga
shipyard in September, is the first ASD tug in
Bilbao's Sertosa fleet - the company's previous tugs
have been of the Voith Schneider type. Azimuthing
propulsion was chosen for this tug, based in Coruna,
as its tows tend to commence in the often-rough open
seas of the Bay of Biscay.
The hull design, lines plans and fabrication drawings
for the Sertosa Treinta, first of a class of two, were
provided by Cintranaval. Steel is used throughout the
double chine hull, superstructure, and wheelhouse.
The hull shape is typical of a stern drive tug, having a
deep forefoot with a slightly angled stem, and a clean
run aft to give the propellers a good flow of water.
The transom is angled forward at waterline level to
improve water flow in astern towage operations.
The hull structure employs material up to 25mm
thick in the bow fender area to cope with large forces
resulting from pushing operations.
Around the
propulsion units, 20mm thick plating with additional
radial stiffening is used to transfer the forces evenly to
the surrounding hull.
The bow Panama chock is sited in the lowest
possible position in order to reduce the dynamic
heeling moment when undertaking escorting
operations. To achieve this, the foredeck has a small
downward ramp in line with the forward towing
winch, effectively taking the pulling point down to
deck level.
Power is provided by two Deutz medium-speed
diesels, each driving a Rolls-Royce 1350H azimuthing
drive with fixed pitch propellers. Twin Disc MCD
clutches are used, to modulate the speed of the vessel
between idle and full engine speed.
Each clutch
incorporates a PTO for driving the hydraulic deck
gear, with a crossover arrangement between pumps to
provide full redundancy.
Other equipment includes Kvaerner fire fighting
pumps and monitors, operated from a joystick control
in the wheelhouse. The towing hook, supplied by
Ferri, is provided with a hydraulic motion dampening
brake for use in rough seas, and is fitted with a heeling
self release arrangement. A Cyteema deck crane is
provided.
Fendering is by Gesrubber, while the
liferafts and rescue boat are from DBS, launched with
Servoship Solas davits.
Fully air conditioned accommodation is provided for
seven crew, with three single cabins in the deck house
and two twin cabins below the foredeck.
The
wheelhouse sits on top of a void space containing the
air conditioning machinery; for optimum visibility
there are no chimney stacks, with the main engine and
generator exhaust pipes running to the top of the
wheelhouse, along with the fire fighting piping.

N May, a new tug, Taurus, was named in the Port
of Gdansk. It was built by Northern Shipyard,
Gdansk, for the Polish company WUZ, to a design
prepared by Northern Shipyard's design offices in
conjunction with Midcon of Szczecin, under the
supervision of chief designer Ilia Georgiew.
The builders say that the main distinguishing
feature of Taurus is the location of the azimuth
thruster.
'The majority of
tugs constructed
nowadays have thrusters located in the aft part of
the hull. Tugs of tractor type have thrusters located
in front of the midship. In Taurus, the thrusters are
installed behind the bottom cover, on one third of
the ship's length, looking from the bow.'
The owner opted for this solution after
considering the operational requirements of the
port of Gdansk, claimed to be the largest bulk and
fuel port on the Eastern Baltic coast. The tug needs
to service large tankers visiting Northern Port as
well as all types of vessels entering the Gdansk ship
repair yard.
As a consequence,
a tug of
considerable strength, with a suitable, precisely
defined pulling power combined with good
manoeuvring characteristics and stability was
required. Northern Shipyard believes that its design
meets these needs.
Although the general tasks for the tug comprise
servicing and assistance through the harbour
entrance and exit, plus independent towing and
assistance at sea up to the third sailing area, its
pulling configuration makes it suitable mainly for
work with the fore area of the serviced vessel, in
conjunction with a traditional aft-driven tug to
handle the stern.
The wheelhouse, located midships, has been
designed for maximum visibility.
It also
incorporates crew room, for up to six persons at sea
or five when working in harbour.
Taurus is claimed to be the first tractor-type tug
built by a Polish shipyard, and the first for several
years for a Polish owner.

A
NEW Z-drive tug was commissioned in May 2001 by
Brusco Tug & Barge Inc for service in Port Hueneme,
California, USA. Wynema Spirit is the latest ASD 24/25
class high-performance tug designed by Robert Allen Ltd
of Vancouver, Canada, specifically for operation with a
two-man crew. The class has its origin with the 22.5m
2400bhp tugs built in the early 1980s for Cates Towing of
Vancouver, and has steadily increased in length and beam
to accommodate increased power and performance.
Wynema Spirit is the first newbuilding in Brusco's fleet.
She is also significant in the method employed by builder
Diversified Marine of Portland, USA. As this was the
yard's first major tug building project, the designers
provided the yard with extensive engineering support,
including complete part definitions in 'kit' form for NC
cutting. All construction and erection took place aboard a
barge floating in the Columbia River. When the tug was
virtually complete in mid-January, the barge was taken to
Cascades General floating drydock, where it was flooded
and the tug floated off. Final outfitting was carried out
afloat.
The vessel is designed to give a large forward working
deck, the aft deck being essentially non-working. The
deckhouse is designed for one-man operation of all
machinery and winch controls. With such an operating
pattern, good visibility is vital and the designers worked
to ensure optimum all-round visibility, particularly to all
areas of the working deck. With increased visibility in
mind, adhesive bonded windows were employed,
thought to be the first time that this technology,
common in passenger and recreational vessel markets,
has been applied to commercial working boats. The
frameless windows ensure the maximum size of viewing
aperture.
Extensive fendering is applied, comprising an array of
Schuyler soft-loop fender on the bow, 305mm square
extruded fender on the main sheer and stern, and an
457mm cylindrical fender across the top of the soft-loop
fender to preclude the hawser being chafed by the upper
edges of
the soft-loop fender.
The fendering
arrangement is completed by an array of heavy-duty
aircraft tyres.
The two gensets, provided by Curry Marine, are fitted
with clutched front PTOs driving hydraulic pumps for
the hawser winch. The electrical system, operated via a
Thompson Technology switchboard, is designed to
allow docking operations to be carried out with AC
power.

A
ccording to builder Halmatic, one of its latest
deliveries has demonstrated the long life enjoyed by
its products. Halmatic says that on current performance a
â€˜one boatâ€™ commercial operator using its boats may only
have to buy four boats in any one century. After 25 years
of service the Port of Shoreham replaced one of its
Halmatic 34 Pilot launches with a new Halmatic Nelson
35.
Having given continuous service with one mid-life refit
the Halmatic 34 Rigel left service following delivery of the
new vessel Altair.
Based on the well proven Nelson hull form Altair is
configured in the same way as the older boat but with all
the expected improvements in layout, noise levels, fuel
consumption, speed and electronic equipment. Operating
up to three miles from the port entrance in the exposed
English channel is a challenge for any boat and particularly
one only 11m long. The significant benefit of the Nelson
35 is its agile performance and seakindly ways which give
the crew confidence in the vessel when wave heights can
be greater than the wheelhouse roof. It is also essential for
Shoreham to have a smaller boat as many of the vessels
operating into the port have low freeboards that can cause
larger pilot vessels difficulties especially when the boat's
freeboard exceeds that of the ship being boarded.
Altair follows standard Nelson practice in being built on
a hull moulded as one piece, using a combination of
woven rovings and chopped strand glass fibre impregnated
with polyester resin. The bow area is strengthened to give
the boat a pushing capability. The plywood bulkheads,
deck joint knees, and engine beds are all bonded into the
hull moulding, and the transom corners radiused to
200mm. An intumescent gel coat is applied in the engine
area for fire protection. The deck and superstructure for
Altair was produced to the short coachroof version, and is
moulded from the same materials as the hull. A flush-
fitting hatch is provided for removal of the engines,
complete with gearboxes.
The engines are flexibly mounted to minimise noise and
vibration, and are cooled by a secondary circuit system
through an engine-mounted heat exchanger.
As with all pilot vessels, substantial fendering is
provided, with a 125mm D-section upper fender and M4
D-section lower rubber fender. Additional rubber
fendering is provided on the quarters, with four diagonals
fitted in the hull on each side. Securing points are included
for 14 tyre fenders. There is a continuous stainless steel
handrail at constant height along both sides and across the
front of the superstructure, all supports being cranked to
allow free movement along the handrails without
impediment. Handrails are also fitted above port and
starboard wheelhouse doors.
The interior is finished in grey fabric, with woodwork in
American light oak, and formica panels to match the
woodwork. A full complement of safety and firefighting
equipment was supplied with the boat.
Halmatic says that it is proud to have been able to offer
continuous support to the Port of Shoreham over a
quarter of a century. Halmatic also built a small 8m steel
workboat for the port that entered service in the summer
of 2001.

P265, delivered during 2001, is the fourth in the
CP25 class of patrol vessels being built for the
Italian Coast Guard by Rodriquez, a company best
known for its hydrofoils and fast ferries. The CP25,
designed by Rodriquez Engineering, the group's
design company, is built entirely from aluminium
alloy, and is intended as a versatile vessel capable of
undertaking coastal patrol,
drug enforcement,
customs, and similar duties.
In order to achieve good performance in a variety of
roles, the CP25 is equipped with a versatile propulsion
system, using three Italian-made Isotta Fraschini
735kW high speed diesels. The two outboard engines
each drive a controllable pitch propeller, with the
central engine connected to a booster waterjet. On all
three engines a 34knot maximum speed is available for
high speed patrol and pursuit, while for normal patrol
the two outboard engines will give 27knots (or
23.5knots at 80% engine power), with a corresponding
increase in range. With two cp propellers mounted
well outboard, manoeuvrability in congested areas is
very good - this is further enhanced by a Rodriquez-
made bow thruster.
The boats are designed to be operated safely with a
crew of four, but for special missions berths are
provided for a maximum of 12 people. The design of
the boat permits a wide variety of
interior
arrangements, depending on operational requirements.
The aft deck carries a 6m RIB, which Rodriquez says
can be easily and safely launched by one person. A
fully integrated wheelhouse control system is
provided, which Rodriquez Engineering designed
ergonomically with a simple and logical operator
interface, allowing the crew to concentrate on their
mission.

WO vessels have recently been delivered by Wang
Tak Engineering & Shipbulding to the Hong Kong
Marine Department for customs patrol duties. The yard
says that the design has proved very successful in the
first months of operation, and the vessels, known as the
Challenger class, are being offered to other paramilitary
and civilian operators for patrol launch requirements.
For operation in Hong Kong territorial waters, good
seakeeping and a stable operational platform were prime
considerations, and Wang Tak developed a 32m round
bilge hull form, with narrow stem, full mid body and flat
stern, incorporating a raised bow, bulge keels and
centreline skeg. The hull was built from steel, with a
two-deck superstructure in aluminium alloy, in order to
keep weight down, all construction being under Lloyd's
Register class survey.
Special attention was paid to the interior design and
fitting out, with an ergonomically-designed wheelhouse
laid out with the help of a full-scale mock-up to simulate
actual operating conditions. The coxswain position is
mounted in the centre, with a raised steering position for
all-round vision, with navigator station to starboard and
machinery controls and monitoring equipment to port.
The chart table and surveillance equipment is sited
behind the navigation station, with another work station
to port for specialised equipment, such as chemical
analysis.
Colour-matched decorative honeycomb
panelling was used throughout the interior, for light-
weight, easy maintenance and a feeling of space. The
accommodation is fully air-conditioned, using Cruisair
equipment, and includes a fully-outfitted galley.
An Avon SR6M RIB is carried on deck, launched and
recovered using a specially-designed Caley davit system
designed for use with the mother ship travelling at up to
10knots.
Normal service speed is 25knots, with a maximum of
29knots.
During sea trials the vessels exhibited,
according to the builders, good motion responses, dry
decks, tight turning circles and stable heeling angle
during fast turns. Noise and vibration levels are claimed
to be particularly low.

T
ONY Castro, naval architects based at Hamble, near
Southampton, UK, was commissioned to develop a
design for a specialised 16m fast intervention and patrol
vessel for the Portuguese Law Enforcement brigade.
The design and development contract was carried out in
collaboration with the builder Conafi SA of Vila Real de
San Antonio in southern Portugal. The company had
previous experience of large GRP mouldings and was
considered to be the best equipped in the country.
The design brief was for a low profile interceptor with
reasonable range, so that surveillance any waiting could
be carried out at sea rather than in port. With Portugal's
comparatively long coastline, speeds of 25/30knots
without too many refuelling stops were required.
The optimised hull form was developed, following an
extensive tank testing programme at DERA Haslar,
where radar signature tests and signal minimisation was
also carried out.
The structural engineering was
optimised to achieve the minimum weight by specialist
marine structural engineers CETEC Consultancy in close
cooperation with Tony Castro Ltd. Following the initial
brief from Tony Castro Ltd, Martec of Southampton,
working with DuPont Inc, developed the ideal
combination of construction materials for the hull and
deck, the resulting blend being a mixture of E-Glass and
Kevlar fibres. A great deal of theoretical modelling and
live testing was performed to provide the boats with a
high level of ballistic protection.
Five crew are normally carried, with sleeping
accommodation for four (assuming at least one is always
on watch). A galley and WC are provided below decks,
while outside, on the aft deck, a small RIB, launched with
the aid of an A-frame gantry, is carried.
Sea trials on the prototype vessel proved that the
required speeds and handling had been achieved, along
with above-average manoeuvrability.
Of the twelve
vessels in the class, eight were scheduled to be delivered by
the end of 2001.

R
IGHT at the start of 2001 a new pilot boat, the
San Francisco, entered service for San Francisco Bar
Pilots, followed in March by a sister vessel, the
California.
Whereas most US ports use the more
normal system of small boats ferrying pilots to and
from ships and shore, two ports - New York and San
Francisco - favour the use of larger station boats,
which remain at sea for extended periods, picking up
pilots from outbound ships and transferring them to
inbound vessels. The San Francisco authority says it
uses this system because of the comparatively long
distance from harbour where pilotage starts - about
25km - and the difficulty of crossing the bar in small
boats in any form of rough weather.
So with pilots having to stay at sea for long periods,
and particularly during bad weather when the bar is
closed to all traffic and the station boat has to remain
afloat outside the harbour - when San Francisco felt
the need to upgrade its pilot fleet, comfort was a high
priority, as well as durability, solidity and safety.
Several types of boat were considered, including a
SWATH design, but doubts about severe weather
durability led to the decision to commission a pair of
displacement monohull boats, built conventionally in
steel. The Marco yard, in Seattle, won the contract
after competitive tendering, and set to design a vessel
that would not only cope with the operating conditions
but also stand up to the physical contact with large
vessels which was inevitable during pilot transfer. This
involved the use of 12.5mm steel plate around the
gunwales,
protected by heavy rubber D-shape
fendering, and supported by extra knees every half
frame and additional longitudinal stiffening.
Although the original brief called for a 15knot speed,
requiring 12-cylinder engines, Marco found that if the
pilots were prepared to settle for 14knots, their design
could achieve this with smaller Caterpillar 3508 main
engines which would offer lower capital cost, lower fuel
consumption, and more interior space for the
accommodation. Despite the lower power, the first
ship made 14.8knots in sea trials.
Marco said the other major challenge was to keep
down noise, which was achieved with the help of a
noise consultant, who managed to limit noise to less
than 65dBA in the lounge, pilots' quarters and crew
accommodation, all of
which are close to the
machinery space. The engines and gearboxes were
soft-mounted on springs, paying particular attention to
shaft alignment. Floating decking was employed in the
pilots' lounge, while bonding vinyl pads, loaded with
lead, in the middle of plating panels, damped out much
of
the structure-borne vibration.
This proved
particularly effective in the crew quarters aft, close to
the propellers.
With the 14knot speed and robust construction, pilot
transfers are much easier than with the older, slower
boats. However, if things do go wrong, the boats are
equipped with ladders at the stern, a Jason's Cradle
recovery system, and a 4.8m Ocean Tech RIB launched
from a cradle in the stern ramp.

T
HE Cochin shipyard in India completed its first-
ever passenger vessels during 2001. It said that
the order, from the Union Territory of Lakshadweep,
was won in international tendering, and it proved that
Indian shipbuilders are able to compete with Korean
and Chinese yards in terms of price and delivery -
construction of both vessels was completed to
budget and within a 17-month period.
Further
evidence of the fast delivery times Cochin can offer,
according to the yard, comes from a large tanker
presently in build, which is scheduled for hand over
in March 2002, when competing yards were quoting
delivery dates six months to a year later.
The pair of passenger ships, Amindivi and Minicoy,
are the sort of versatile small passenger/cargo vessels
which used to be common as the lifeblood for small,
mainly island-based, communities, providing not only
links with larger towns and other communities for
people, but carried all types of vital cargo. This pair
has a capacity for 150 passengers, as well as 20tonnes
of general dry cargo and an additional 5tonnes of
refrigerated freight capacity.
As well as catering
facilities, the passenger accommodation includes
another important part of Indian life - a separate
room for prayer.
Although the ships may be traditional in role and
appearance, in terms of equipment they rank with
other 21st-century deliveries. The propulsion plant
centres around twin Caterpillar 12-cylinder diesels,
and the electronics provision includes up-to-date
equipment from worldwide suppliers.

ITH the growth of Long Beach, California, as
a convention and visitor destination, the goal of
efficiently 
moving 
people 
while 
decreasing
congestion is at the forefront of
Long Beach
Transit's development plans. With this in mind, the
authority decided to supplement its fleet of two
15.24m monohull passenger ferries with a third,
larger, vessel.
The 19.8m x 7.3m all-aluminium Aqualink was
designed by Crowther Multihulls of Australia and
built in the USA by Kvichak Marine Industries of
Seattle. With a capacity for 75 passengers, the ferry
operates between the Long Beach downtown
waterfront area and Alamitos Bay, where it connects
with LBT's bus services.
Transit time is 20mins-30mins. This is achieved
through a machinery package comprising two
Cummins N14 diesel engines driving through ZF
IRM350A marine reduction gears. The engines are
each rated at 525hp at 2100rev/min.
Revenue is
maximised through the provision on board of a snack
bar kiosk, serving food and beverages in the main
passenger cabin.
The kiosk is outfitted with
refrigerator, coffee brewing system, icemaker, soft
drink dispenser, sink, and Corian bar top.
According to LBT, the authority is rated as one of
the USA's top ten performers for mass transit. It
serves over 28 million boarding customers per year.
Aqualink is operated on behalf of Long Beach
Transit by Catalina Express.

A
USTAL'S first Auto Express 101 ferry made its
debut in May 2001 for the Spanish operator
Euroferrys. The 101m Euroferrys Pacifica is not only the
largest Auto Express-built, but is also the largest
diesel-powered high-speed catamaran anywhere. The
ferry operates on a short 16nm route between
Algeciras and Ceuta in Spanish Morocco, completing
six return crossings per day.
It replaces a 78m fast
ferry and one conventional ferry on the Ceuta route,
reducing operating costs while providing an improved
service.
Austal says it was able to satisfy Euroferrys
requirements for fast turnaround times and the ability
to carry substantial commercial vehicle loads on the
short, high-frequency route, thanks to an innovative
Austal-designed hoistable vehicle deck which allows a
mix of car and commercial freight carriage.
Previous Auto Express ferries have accommodated a
12tonne axle load suitable for loading buses, but the
Auto Express 101 has a 15tonne axle load. Lane widths
are 3.5m and the bow door allows full use of the
341lane metres available for heavy freight of the total
1190lane metre length.
The full-length hoistable
vehicle deck has four hydraulically operated sections
that can be operated together or independently and can
be raised or lowered in less than one minute.
Fitted with four Caterpillar 3618 engines generating
28,800kW and the Seastate TMax high-speed steering
system, Euroferrys Pacifica achieved 37knots during
trials with 500tonne load at 90% MCR. Given the
short and relatively sheltered crossing, the motion
control system's forward foils were not installed but the
system is designed to easily enable the full installation.
Austal worked with Oliver Design of Spain to create
an attractive and contemporary vessel styling, inside
and out.
The design brief
took into account
characteristics of the operation such as the short
duration and the potential passenger mix to creating an
environment which would be both pleasant and in
which onboard sales would maximise operational
revenue.
The passenger accommodation is located on one
main deck, with a central atrium and stairway leading to
an outside observation area immediately aft of the
wheelhouse. Panoramic windows, domes and skylights
make the most of natural light and provide enhanced
scenic vision.
A forward lounge is designated for
business class passengers.
Crew accommodation, change rooms, mess and
lounge areas are located between the bridge and upper
deck forward. The wheelhouse is comprehensively
outfitted with the latest navigation and communication
equipment including a Vistar night vision anti-collision
system. An Austal-developed Marine Link system
provides monitoring of machinery and systems, with a
powerful online documentation system. Four RFD
marine evacuation systems are fitted.

n a testament to the capability of Incat craft, the US
Navy has joined a consortium led by the US Army to
operate Incat 050. Renamed Joint Venture HSV-X1 (High
Speed Vessel - Experimental One) in recognition of the
partnership of component commands from the US
Navy, Army, Marine Corps, US Special Operations
Command and Coast Guard, the craft will serve to
enhance mission capability in a broad range of
scenarios. Together the US military sectors will explore
the operational implications and opportunities of new
marine technologies that are bringing higher speeds,
longer ranges and increased payload capacities to
surface vessels.
This is the first major project undertaken by the
strategic alliance formed last year between Bollinger
Shipyards of Louisiana, USA, and the Incat shipyard in
Tasmania, Australia.
Undergoing a major refit in September 2001, the craft
has been upgraded and fitted with military
enhancements such as a helicopter deck, stern quarter
ramp, RIB deployment gantry, troop facilities, crew
accommodation and more. The craft emerged from
Incat's new Wilson's drydock, having been transformed
and capable of carrying the required 363 persons,
military vehicles and equipment over 1110nm at a speed
greater than 35knots.
In her fresh role with the US military, Joint Venture no
longer enjoys the luxury of having dedicated shore-side
linkspans available to load and discharge her cargo. To
this end, an aluminium folding ramp has been fitted to
the stern starboard quarter of the craft. Measuring an
impressive 12.7m length overall x 4.46m wide, the ramp
consists of two major units to enable it to fold in half
using a combination of cable and hydraulic control
mechanisms. This form of construction allows the
ramp to be lowered in either straight or semi-folded
configuration.
The ramp, which has been designed and certified in
accordance with Det Norske Veritas (DNV) rules, is
configured to allow direct stern to bulkhead on-
load/off-load to a pier height of 3.05m above Mean
Low Low Water (MLLW) with a 1m to 1.5m tidal range.
The ramp itself has a capacity of 33,112kg over the full
operating range from 0.5m above waterline to 3.05 m
above the waterline.
The deployment of Joint Venture with the US military
forces is a significant step forward in the research and
development of High Speed Craft for Fast Sealift
operations. With its high operational speed, long-range
deployment capabilities combined with a high
deadweight capacity, the craft has set the benchmark for
future Fast Sealift acquisitions, for both the military and
commercial sectors alike.

A
LTHOUGH listed as a 2001 delivery, the Scottish
yard Corpach Boatbuilders in fact launched the
MV Laig Bay just before Christmas 2000 for well-
known ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. At
just 10.5m in length and with a passenger capacity of
28, the Laig Bay replaced the traditional timber built
MV Ulva as the 'Flit' boat serving the Isle of Eigg
community on the West Coast of Scotland.
The
traditional small island Flit boat ferry role has,
according to Corpach, been all but superseded by
modern piers and docking facilities but the Isle of
Eigg, which has no pier, thus still relies on a Flit boat
to transfer goods and passengers to and from the
schedule supply steamer, in this case the new 45m
Small Isles ferry Loch Nevis.
Certification under Class VIA and Workboat
Category IV dictated a fully decked hull design of all
welded steel transversely framed in 50x50 angle with
5mm hull plating and one compartment flooded
stability required five transverse bulkheads. All hull
spaces thus created are voids except the midships
compartment, this being the engine room containing
the Mermaid Mariner 6-cylinder Ford derivative engine
de-rated to 110hp at 2200rev/min. Driving a single
three blade bronze propeller via a PRM gearbox, the
vessel can achieve 9knots on a 14tonne lightship and
her passenger/cargo dead-weight is 3.48tonnes. Above
deck she has a small open backed wheelhouse forward
containing the fairly minimal equipment required but
including GMDSS radio compass.
Wills Ridley
hydraulic steering, wiper, circuit breaker electric
distribution and engine controls and panel.
The vessel was launched in a 100% finished
condition and was on station at the Island of Eigg on
21 December 2000 having successfully completed all
owner's and MCA trials.
Tom McNeill, technical
director for Caledonian MacBrayne said 'Laig Bay is
now in service and meets all our requirements. I must
thank Corpach Boatyard for all the work they did and
the speed in which they carried out the design and
construction of the vessel. Caledonian MacBrayne are
impressed with Corpach Boatbuilding Company and
we look forward to continuing business with them.'

AID of the Harbour was the first vessel to be
delivered by the newly-formed steel boat building
division of Halmatic, a Vosper Thornycroft company.
She is operated by Brownsea Island Ferries Ltd within
Poole Harbour and the surrounding area, providing ferry
services from Poole Town Quay to Brownsea Island and
Sandbanks.
The vessel is based on the design of an
existing passenger vessel owned by Brownsea Island
Ferries, but has seen many modifications by Halmatic's
own design team, most notably to allow use for corporate
entertainment and specialist tours.
The ship meets the MCA requirements for Class V and
VI (Category C waters) to carry 185 passengers with five
crew; having seating for 110 on the upper deck and 66
seated at tables in the main saloon. In the main saloon
there is also a dance floor and bar which adjoins the galley
for use when the vessel is on corporate charter.
The twin screw ferry is constructed entirely in steel with
a double chine hull form and a raked, soft nosed stem and
six watertight compartments; the fore peak, the auxiliary
machinery compartment, two void spaces, engine room,
and the steering flat/aft peak. The majority of the steel
used in construction is 6mm plate, bar and section with
girders and engine beds increased to 8mm. In between
the machinery spaces are the fuel oil, fresh water, and soil
tanks.
The deckhouse, which is large enough to
accommodate the crew, is mounted on the upper deck.
In the fully insulated main machinery space, two Volvo
Penta TMD 102A engines with a rating of
198kW at 1800rev/min driving conventional propellers
through Twin Disc MG5091 gearboxes are fitted. In the
auxiliary machinery space is a 40kVA generator set
supplied by Beta Marine and a Perkins B4GM diesel
driven hydraulic pump that powers the Celtic Propulsion
Systems series 300 bow thruster.
All controls are located in the deckhouse on the upper
deck. The helm controls a Wills Ridley steering gear, a
Kobelt single station control head looks after the
operation of the gearbox and engine speed while a
joystick lever provides directional control of the bow
thruster. Also positioned around the helmsman are the
navigational aids including a Furuno M-841 radar,
Raytheon ST40 depth sounder, Sailor RT 4822 VHF
radio with integral DSC and a Phontech 4 way public
address system.
The vessel was finished in a paint system supplied by Jotun
and was on service in eight months from contract signature.

A
ALTJE Postma L-757, a 31m stern trawler, was
designed and built by Dutch yard Barkmeijer
Stroobos for Danish owners.
The design and
equipment was intended to provide a particularly
versatile vessel, with winches for both twin-rigging
and flyshooting. All winches are remotely controlled
from the wheelhouse.
The main engine, a single medium speed diesel
supplied as a complete propulsion package with
gearbox and CP propeller by MAN B&W Alpha of
Denmark, is resiliently mounted for minimal noise
and vibration in the accommodation, which was built
according to Danish accommodation regulations,
with wheelhouse and crew quarters situated forward.
The vessel was built to BV class.
For twin-rigging, the nets are lowered through the
openings in the aftship bulwarks, with the centre trawl
wire connected via the centre sheave on deck to the
line length and pull measurement systems. While
lowering nets the drum is controlled locally, with two
crew looking after the drums and two crew bringing
the nets overboard. Once both nets are connected to
the trawl wires, control passes to the wheelhouse.
Hoisting and emptying nets is also carried out by four
crew, two on the shelterdeck and two on the aft deck.
When flyshooting, the nets are prepared and
connected to the flyshooting ropes in advance while
working on the aft deck.
Arriving at the fishing
grounds,
a buoy is put overboard from the
shelterdeck, and the full length of the rope, between
the forerunner connected to the buoy and the aft
storage drum on the fish processing deck, is deployed
while sailing at about 10knots. When the end of the
rope is reached, the rope is disconnected from the
forerunner, the net pulled overboard, and shooting
the other side rope is started, with the trawler sailing
back towards the buoy in a circle. Both rope are
hauled at the same speed, controlled from the
wheelhouse, so that the last part of the net is brought
above the receiving bin hatch.
The 8m3 receiving bin leads to a 143m3 fish
processing room, equipped with ventilation system,
electric heaters and conveyors, rinsing and sorting
machines able to deal with six fish species.
The
sorted catch is rinsed and transported to six receiving
bins in the fish hold where it is weighed in 5kg boxes.
The fish hold has two freezing chambers, one for
freezing down the catch and the other for storage at -
20ÂºC.
Safety equipment includes two Viking 10-man
inflatable liferafts, a Thorn fire detection system, an
Ajax engine room CO2 extinguishing system, and a
Desmi firefighting pump.

A
FTER a comprehensive European tender
procedure by the Cornwall County Sea Fisheries
Committee, a contract was awarded to Damen
Shipyards for the design and construction of a 27m
patrol craft. This resulted in the Saint Piran, designated
as a Damen Stan Patrol 2707.
The design closely
follows the successful series of 26m patrol vessels built
for, among others, Hong Kong police, Hong Kong
customs, and Dutch customs.
Saint Piran is an all aluminium vessel with a multi
chined hull form. The vessel is equipped with two
Cummins diesel engines, driving fixed pitch propellers.
The contract speed of 20knots was well exceeded to
nearly 22knots and engine power was reduced
afterwards to maintain the speed at 20.0knots. This has
given significant margin for the engines to achieve a
long life without excessive wear.
Besides that the
engines are rated at a moderate, heavy duty output of
970kW each. The machinery space is ventilated by two
axial flow fans of 15.000m3/h each. The generator sets
are keel cooled for long life and easy maintenance.
Sound absorbing boxes are fitted around the generator
sets.
The vessel has three accommodation decks. The
lower deck accommodates the crew quarters with three
cabins, laundry with washing machine and dryer,
shower and toilet. Ample storage is also provided here.
The main deck has an entrance from the aft deck in a
partly covered and sheltered area.
The deckhouse
contains a laboratory with stainless steel worktops,
sanitary space with shower and toilet, mess and galley
and a heating and ventilation room forward.
The
accommodation is also equipped with air-conditioning.
Via a stairway from the mess one can reach the
wheelhouse that provides a 360deg visibility.
The
accommodation spaces are sound insulated resulting
sound levels well below 70dB(A).
Control stations are fitted in the wheelhouse, flying
bridge and via special wing stations at the wheelhouse
deck at the forward end. The extensive equipment of
the craft includes a tender RIB in a slipway at the stern.
This slipway has a hydraulically operated door and
hauling winch. A deck crane is fitted for handling small
objects at sea. At the stem a capstan of l000kg is fitted
to assist when other small craft have to be towed in to
safe ports.
Saint Piran is also equipped with a fire
fighting installation with water monitor at the fore deck.

EMINI Workboats, located on the UK East
Coast, delivered only its second newbuilding
early in 2001, following delivery of a small catamaran
trawler late in 2000. Standsure, a Gemini G10 model,
designed to operate as a prawn creeler for a customer
in Ullapool, Scotland, is a 9.83m catamaran built for
strength and a large carrying capacity. The latter is
achieved through a large aft working deck area,
incorporating vivier tanks aft in each of the hulls and
engine spaces amidships with access from the deck.
The engines, Mermaid Melody II Ford-based diesels,
are derated to 72.5bhp and despite this relatively low
power Standsure can easily achieve its 8knot service
speed with a 6tonne payload and managed 9.2knots
light ship on its delivery voyage.
Two sets of batteries are fitted, one for engine
starting and the other for the equipment, which
includes two Jabsco pumps for deck washing and the
viviers. Ballast tanks are situated in the aft quarters
and under the cabin floor, which allow the boat to be
balanced when static gear fishing.
Gemini says it is prepared to deliver boats in various
stages of completion, with Standsure being built minus
electronics, hydraulics and prawn sorting table, which
were to be fitted by the owner after delivery. A basic
sailaway vessel is available for just under Â£77,000.
Either forward or aft wheelhouse versions are
available, and a number of different engine types can
be fitted.
A lighter, faster version of the G10, the Fastcat, with
lower freeboard and semi-displacement hull form, has
been introduced, which the yard says offers much
higher speeds while maintaining a good carrying
capacity and sea keeping qualities.

I
N January 2001, Dubai Drydocks delivered a new
aluminium crewboat to Mutawa Marine of Abu Dhabi,
for service in the Arabian Gulf offshore oil industry. The
boat is the first newbuilding in welded aluminium for the
yard, and was the first in a proposed new line of 25m-50m
crewboats, capable of up to 30knots service speeds, to be
offered to clients worldwide.
Canadian designer Robert Allan Ltd provided the yard
with a complete contract design package and production
working drawings, based on the end-user's specific
operating requirements. The design brief was for a good
combination of speed, capacity, manoeuvrability and
seakeeping in a vessel of modest size. The boat features a
spacious forward wheelhouse with good all-round and
overhead visibility, and a large passenger area with
comfortable seating for 31 persons. Below decks are crew
quarters for six, galley, and lavatory facilities. The engine
room is accessible via large hatches in the aft deck,
permitting access for servicing, repair and replacement of
engines or other major components. The aft deck is
strengthened for carrying cargo, with a design capacity of
20tonnes.
The machinery package includes twin high-speed diesel
engines, each driving a five-bladed propeller through a
reverse-reduction gearbox. Two diesel generators are also
fitted.
On sea trails,
the Khulood
demonstrated good
performance good manoeuvrability at high and low speeds,
and a stable and comfortable ride.
