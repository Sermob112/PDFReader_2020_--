ovember 2020 saw Australian shipbuilder 
Austal deliver the first commercial vessel 
constructed entirely at its 9,820m2 Vung Tau 
facility in Vietnam since that site commenced 
operations in March 2018.
A.P.T. James was handed over to the National 
Infrastructure Development Company (NIDCO) 
of Trinidad and Tobago, which will use it to 
shuttle passengers and their vehicles across the 
‘sea bridge’ linking the two Caribbean islands. 
The ferry was named after Alphonso James, a 
Tobago-born politician and businessman who 
was mainly politically active between the 
1940s-1960s. The vessel is the first in Austal’s 
Auto Express 94 class, designed by Austal’s 
Australian division. 
The all-aluminium ferry features a raked-bow 
design and has been equipped with four MAN 
16V 28/33D diesel main engines: a brand more 
commonly associated with naval and patrol 
applications, albeit one that has found its way 
onto superyachts (and which Austal previously 
installed aboard its 112.6m catamaran Leonora 
Christina, delivered to Nordic Ferry Services  
in 2011). 
The engines drive four Kamewa S3-112 
waterjets through Reintjes VLJ 7531 gearboxes, 
granting A.P.T. James a cruising speed of 
37.5knots at 90% MCR. 
To balance high speed with crew and passenger 
comfort, Austal has also fitted the ship with an 
advanced motion control system. For fuel storage, 
the vessel relies on a pair of 80,000litre-capacity 
tanks, while onboard passenger facilities include a 
large kiosk and two bar areas. Class society DNV 
GL has granted A.P.T.  James the notation X1A 
HSLC R1 Ferry B E0. 
Austal’s Vung Tau yard currently employs 
around 450 personnel. Speaking around the time 
of the ferry’s handover in November 2020, David 
Singleton, Austal CEO, commented: “Austal 
Vietnam is now clearly a valuable asset in our 
commercial vessel shipbuilding network, building 
upon and complementing the growing capability 
in the Philippines, while also freeing up capacity 
in our Australian shipyard for additional defence 
contracts for the Royal Australian Navy and 
export markets.”

here’s been a renewed wave of investments 
in the Brazilian offshore sector, spurring 
demand for highly specialised support vessels. 
There’s especially been demand for vessels that 
can serve as platforms for diving operations and 
ROV surveys, to safeguard assets located in 
deep waters. 
As a result, offshore operator Belov Engenharia 
took the decision to build and operate two new 
dive support vessels at its new fabrication facility 
in the port city of Salvador. Robert Allan Ltd 
(RAL) was commissioned to provide the support 
vessel’s design, which is an example of the naval 
architect’s RAlly 4000 class. 
The 40.5m Belov Humaitá and her sister, Belov 
Amaralina, have each been fitted with a DP2 
dynamic positioning system, four diesel 
generators, three waterjets and triple bow 
thrusters for redundancy. RAL explains: “The 
propulsion system is diesel-electric to improve 
efficiency when operating in lower-power DP 
modes.” Waterjets were selected instead of 
propellers so as to ensure diver safety. “Because 
waterjets are typically used on higher-speed 
vessels, extensive self-propelled CFD analysis, 
including waterjet tunnel flow, was performed 
in-house by RAL to verify resistance and thrust 
at the slower speeds that this design will operate 
at when on station,” the designer adds. 
The RAlly 4000 was also designed to be fitted 
with an ROV launch and recovery system 
(LARS), plus an aft-mounted A-frame to operate 
the diving bell. Other features include a 
decompression chamber and spacious crew 
quarters, with RAL and Belov managing to keep 
the gross tonnage under 500tonnes. 
Class society RINA has certified Belov Humaitá 
and her sister as Special Diving Support vessels, 
suitable for Unrestricted Navigation.

elivered by Sanmar Shipyards to Sanmar’s 
towage arm in January 2020, Boğaçay XXXIII 
is the first tug to be powered by Caterpillar’s 
Advanced 
Variable 
Drive 
(AVD) 
hydro-
mechanical hybrid propulsion system, and has 
been described as an evolution of Robert Allan 
Limited’s (RAL’s) RAmparts 2400-SX design. 
The hydro-mechanical hybrid propulsion system 
consists of two dual-input, continuously variable 
transmissions located in the shaftlines between the 
main engines and the Z-drives. The AVDs are fed 
solely by the auxiliary engine in transit mode, from 
the CAT 3512 main engines in work mode, and 
from both the main engines and the auxiliary 
engine in boost mode.  
Power is delivered to two fixed-pitch Z-drives via 
the continuously variable transmissions.  RAL 
says: “It is noteworthy that with this system, the 
engines are smaller than would normally be the 
case in a tug of this power – CAT 3512 instead of 
3516 engines.” The auxiliary engine also drives the 
tug’s firefighting pump.  
RAL continues: “In addition to the fuel-saving 
modes of operation, another significant advantage of 
the system is that the continuously variable 
transmission can modulate propeller speed down to 
0rpm like a slipping clutch. It can also spin the propeller 
up faster than would be possible if the engine was 
directly coupled to the drive, allowing the engines to 
operate in their peak-efficiency zone instead of along 
the propeller demand curve at higher specific fuel oil 
consumption, resulting in significant fuel savings.”
Other claimed benefits of the AVD 
arrangement include improved response and 
acceleration, plus lower lifetime maintenance 
costs as a result of the reduced hours on the 
main engines.

T
he Damen Ferry (DFe) 2306 E3 vessel type, 
of which Bryggen was the first in class, 
features an all-electric, completely emission-free 
propulsion system. Seven of the vessels are now 
operating in Copenhagen, operating from three 
charging points. The vessels feature Damen’s E3 
notation, which stands for ‘environmentally 
friendly’, 
‘efficient 
in 
operation’ 
and 
‘economically viable’. 
The electric propulsion system of this class has 
been redesigned to allow for fully electric 
operation. For optimal efficiency, the amount of 
electrical converters was minimised and highly 
efficient electric motors were used. Lithium-
titanate oxide (LTO)- type batteries were used for 
energy storage, these ships being the first with a 
DNV GL classification for this system. 
These batteries make it possible to charge with 
high capacities (>3C) in a short timeframe, and 
ensure that the existing timetable of the ships can 
be maintained. Additionally, the batteries have a 
lifespan of 12 years, which means that they have 
to be changed only once over the expected 
lifespan of the vessel. 
To enable charging with high power, components 
from the automotive bus industry were used to 
optimise the ratio of reliability and costs. To make 
these components applicable, an automatic 
mooring system was developed, which ensures that 
the ships are coupled to the jetties with minimal 
vessel movements. As a result, the electrical 
connection has been simplified and as much space 
as possible saved on the jetties and the ship. The 
automatic mooring system also improves safety for 
passengers while boarding and disembarking, and 
ensures that the charger cannot disconnect due to 
sudden movements. Finally, energy consumption 
during mooring is significantly reduced because 
the electric motors can be stopped.
To ensure that the entire electrical system 
(hardware and software) functions optimally, 
Damen made a full-scale test set-up, in which the 
entire electrical installation was built and the 
operational route simulated over a long period. 
As a result, the future crew was able to become 
acquainted with the new bridge and the control of 
the electric powertrain. “Ultimately, the test 
set-up ensured that a lot of time was saved during 
the tests,” Damen says. 
Also of significance, because the ships have a 
100% zero-emission propulsion system, the 
reduction in total emissions from public transport 
in Copenhagen will contribute to the city's 
emission targets.
Economic benefits were also achieved with the 
construction of these vessels. As the City of 
Copenhagen has launched the tender for a 
12-year operation, the provider has the 
opportunity to reduce its operational costs. 
Damen adds: “It is even expected that these will 
be reduced to such an extent that the total costs 
over the 12 years, including the initial investment 
for both the ships and the loading installations, 
will be lower than those for operating a 
conventionally powered variant of the ship.”

P329 is one of the first two vessels in a five-
boat order for the Italian Coast Guard 
(Guardia Costiera), a series of search and rescue 
(SAR) vessels completed through 2020. These 
boats represent the latest models and additions 
to the Coast Guard’s Class 300 fleet, built by 
Italian yard Cantiere Navale Vittoria. 
With their 20m lengths, self-righting 
capabilities and potential speeds of 35knots, 
along with significant rescued survivor 
capacities, the Class 300 boats are well-equipped 
for their SAR missions in the Mediterranean. 
The design is the latest SAR craft from Camarc 
Design of the UK, and all five boats share the 
Camarc double chine hull, a proven form for 
enhanced seakeeping in challenging conditions 
and heavy weather operations.
The all-aluminium vessels were built to RINA 
requirements, along with a dedicated class 
notation and RINA rule set for both ‘self-
righting’ and ‘unsinkable’ capabilities. As is 
typical with Camarc designs, self-righting is 
inherent to the design, and this capability does 
not rely on closing devices nor vent closures. 
Additionally, these particular craft are also sub-
divided and fitted with internal foam,  to 
maintain positive buoyancy in a worst-case 
scenario of damage affecting all watertight 
compartments – hence RINA awarding the 
series the ‘Unsinkable’ notation.
The vessel arrangement features a centrally 
positioned wheelhouse to provide command 
and control stations for the five-man crew, with 
all-round visibility. A raised outside flybridge 
with helm conning position is provided to 
facilitate rescue operations. Rescue stations for 
recovery of persons are placed port and 
starboard with deck wells and davits, along 
with one at the transom with a full-width 
deployable rescue platform. 
The forward survivor cabins beneath the 
raised foredeck are simply arranged with bench 
seating for maximum capacity, and the internal 
and external decks can accommodate up to 200 
survivors. The craft are equipped with two 
high-capacity liferafts aft, for rescued persons, 
and a smaller crew liferaft.
A large section fender has been fitted around 
the hulls to protect CP329 and her sisters 
during routine operations and when coming 
alongside other vessels during rescues. Towing 
arrangements are also provided aft for use in 
rescue operations.
Twin MTU engines with ZF 665 gearboxes 
drive Kamewa waterjets, giving the craft a top 
speed in excess of 35knots. A significant fuel 
capacity of just over 7,000litres also provides 
for a range in excess of 565nm.

is putting the boat to use in coastal and 
territorial waters.
The FSD N800 features a composite hull, 
fashioned from carbon fibre and glass fibre. 
Although this first model runs on MAN diesels, 
the core unit is flexible, enabling the use of an 
environmentally conscious, new-generation 
hybrid propulsion system (such as those produced 
by Transfluid, selected for the forthcoming second-
in-class vessel), depending on the Carabinieri's 
request. These hybrid versions (which will be 
referred to as FSD N800 HY units) will enable the 
boats to patrol eco-sensitive areas in zero-
emissions mode. The Carabinieri’s requirement for 
this electric propulsion mode was for an endurance 
of one hour when operating at 7knots. 
FSD explains: "The vessel can be fitted with an 
additional electric propulsion system coupled with 
the standard thermal propulsion engines [TPEs], 
to operate in zero-emission mode. The system 
consists of two three-phase electric motors with 
permanent magnets, each delivering 75kw, 
mounted between the TPEs and the shaft lines; and 
two latest-generation battery packs with lithium-
iron phosphate cells, each one 288V - 100Ah, all 
managed by an integrated monitoring system."
As with a previous FSD model, the FSD 195, 
the FSD N800's hull has been based on that of 
the Pershing 64 motor yacht. However, the FSD 
N800 has tweaked this a little to reduce its 
weight and boost its rigidity. The vessel can 
operate safely in conditions up to sea state 4 
and achieve speeds of more than 30knots at full 
load, and crew protection is enabled by shock-
absorbing seats supplied by Canada’s Shoxs.

401 is the first in a new class of 
environmentally friendly 29m passenger 
ferries, designed by Incat Crowther for 
Hornblower’s continually expanding NYC 
Ferry fleet. The Incat Crowther Digital Ship 
design package allowed H401 and her identical 
sisters, Curiosity and City Fish, to be 
constructed 
at 
independent 
shipyards:  
namely, Halimar Shipyard of Morgan City, 
Louisiana and Breaux Brothers Enterprises  
of Loreauville, Louisiana.
Although the vessels were commissioned 
prior to the current pandemic, Incat Crowther 
said that it is expected that the high passenger 
demand NYC Ferry has experienced since 
commencing operations in 2017 will return. 
The new vessels complement the 17  
Incat Crowther-designed 26m vessels and 
14  ×  29m vessels that have already been 
delivered to NYC Ferry. 
Four additional 26m vessels are currently 
under construction at Gulf Craft and Metal 
Shark (both of Franklin, Louisiana) along with 
an additional 29m vessel under construction at 
St John’s Shipbuilding in Palatka, Florida. Upon 
completion of these additional vessels, the NYC 
Ferry fleet will have grown to a total of 38 
vessels in just over three years.
The new vessels include seats for 354 
passengers, dedicated bicycle storage, disability 
access, mobile device charging stations, WiFi 
connectivity and a well-equipped onboard 
convenience store. All of the trio are equipped 
with main engines from Baudouin: however, 
unlike any of the previous NYC Ferry vessels in 
operation, these newcomers utilise US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Tier 4-compliant engines, to curb emissions. In 
order to bring the engines into compliance with 
Tier 4, Incat Crowther integrated a Baudouin-
supplied selective catalytic reduction (SCR) 
system into the vessel design, along with the 
necessary urea tanks and dosing system 
components.
Incat adds: “The innovative NYC Ferry fleet 
has been developed in close co-operation with 
Hornblower, leveraging Incat Crowther’s 
comprehensive digital design package and 
expertise in the US ferry industry to satisfy 
challenging operational and regulatory 
requirements.”

aunched in March, Helen Rice was designed 
by Macduff Ship Design and completed by 
Ferguson Marine Engineering at its yard on the 
River Clyde. The vessel, described by Macduff as 
a “multirole workboat”, features a large, open 
working deck with offset port casing, for 
improved starboard side access, in addition to a 
sizeable forward ramp. This layout is intended to 
help her complement achieve a wide range of 
tasks, ranging from general cargo transportation 
to niche aquaculture-related duties.
Macduff Ship Design originally commenced 
the detailed design process in September 2018, 
with Ferguson Marine Engineering cutting the 
first steel in early 2019. Helen Rice is 
constructed entirely in steel and features a 
hard-chine, landing craft-style hullform. 
According to Macduff, the design was inspired 
“by combining the operational requirements 
for a landing craft bow with the successful 
clean open deck of the Macduff multirole vessel 
Suffolk Spirit” – a 26m loa vessel launched in 
2012. Macduff adds: “The vessel with its new 
layout complements Inverlussa Marine’s 
existing fleet, and will join four existing 
Macduff-designed vessels.” Another vessel was 
delivered at the end of 2020. 
The workboat is equipped with an array of 
equipment permitting her to operate in various 
roles.  Main propulsion is provided by twin Doosan 
4L126TIH engines delivering 316kW@2,000rpm. 
These engines drive through Dongi gearboxes 
connected to open propellers supplied by 
Teignbridge Propulsion. 
On deck, there are two marine cranes to starboard, 
both of which were supplied by HS Marine: these 
comprise an AK61/19.5E5 and an AK13 HE3.  The 
hydraulic package also comprises: three 5tonne 
capstans, all arranged to starboard; an anchor 
windlass; hydraulic rams, for operation of the bow 
ramp; and a tow winch situated on the centre line. 
Due to the offset position of the casing, the winch 
can work both aft, over a stern roller with portable 
pins and a gog eye to control the wire, or forward, 
over a narrow roller built into the bow ramp.
Helen Rice also has a notable cargo-carrying 
capability for her size; she boasts a maximum capacity 
of 90tonnes of deck cargo or, alternatively, the ability 
to carry two full ISO tanks.

T
he 33m ferry I See One was designed by 
One2Three Naval Architects of Australia 
and built by Wight Shipyard Co. (WSC), UK as 
a bespoke, passenger-only vessel for Captain 
Morgan Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Fortina 
Investments. 
Designed to be lighter and more fuel-efficient 
than anything the yard has built previously, the 
vessel is the first of a four-ferry order 
comprising  two 33m and two 20m ferries.
The two 33m medium-speed ferries have 
been tasked with servicing a new commuter/
tourist hop-on/hop-off service along the east 
coast of Malta, as far as the island of Gozo, and 
will speedily carry commuters and tourists 
between different locations around the coast. 
While the ferries are intended to operate 
below 20knots they are capable, under the IMO 
High-Speed Craft (HSC) Code, of achieving a 
top speed in excess of 30knots.
The main deck features an enclosed, air-
conditioned cabin with seating and a kiosk/bar 
located at the aft end, while the open upper 
deck offers a panoramic view of the local 
Maltese scenery, and has a large overhanging 
roof to shield passengers from rain. WSC says: 
“The passenger loading was challenging in that 
the vessels have to service an assortment of 
Malta’s historic stone wharfs, and are fitted 
with multiple side and aft gangways in order to 
provide significant variability in both the 
location and boarding heights.”
The vessel has been wrapped in an eye-
catching vinyl design to match the rest of the 
hop on/hop off fleet of buses that operate 
across the island. 
Fitted with four toilets and six disabled 
spaces, the vessel can carry 298 passengers and 
four crew. I See One is powered by twin MAN 
D2862 LE422 marine diesel engines, rated a 
combined 1,498kW@2,100rpm, and these are 
coupled with a pair of ZF3000 marine 
transmissions and two Veem five-bladed, fixed 
propellers.

K
aguya has been hailed as Japan’s first LNG 
bunkering vessel, delivered by Kawasaki 
Heavy Industries (KHI) to Central LNG Shipping 
Japan Corporation (CLS), a joint venture owned 
by Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, 
JERA Co. and Toyota Tsusho Corporation. The 
vessel will conduct its bunkering activities at 
JERA Kawagoe Thermal Power Station, in Japan’s 
Chubu region. 
Its main feature is a 3,500m3 IMO Type-C cargo 
tank, made of robust aluminium alloy. A dual-fuel 
auxiliary boiler, capable of burning boil-off gas 
(BOG), was installed to ensure operational flexibility. 
By adopting a single-tank concept, the total weight 
of the vessel has been reduced; meanwhile, 
operational redundancy was optimised through 
installing multiple pumps inside the cargo tank. 
For thermal insulation, the cargo tank has 
adopted the Kawasaki Panel System, which 
incorporates KHI’s patented technology – a blend 
of phenolic resin foam (PRF) and polyurethane 
foam (PUF). KHI says that this technology has 
been applied to various LNG carriers, ranging 
from small-scale vessels to Moss-type vessels with 
capacities up to 182,000m3.
Kaguya has been fitted with foam-type fenders, 
fender davits and ship-to-ship transfer equipment 
– the latter including LNG transfer hoses, 
emergency release couplings and emergency 
shutdown systems. Four bunkering manifolds 
were installed: two on both sides, midships, and 
two on both sides, bow. Additionally, hose-
handling cranes were installed on the starboard 
and port sides. 
Kaguya also incorporates a ‘ballast-free’ 
concept, for reduced maintenance. The propulsive 
arrangement includes a controllable-pitch 
propeller, a Schilling rudder, a stern thruster and 
a bow thruster, for precise thrust control and high 
manoeuvrability during in-port navigation and 
bunkering operations.

L
aunched in August 2020, and with delivery 
imminent at time of writing, Koc Al Zour 
comprises a multipurpose oil spill recovery 
vessel and the first RAmpage 6000 class vessel to 
be constructed. At 60m loa, this also happens to 
be the largest vessel in naval architect RAL’s 
RAmpage series.
The ASD vessel has been outfitted to undertake 
operations such as oil spill response duties, oil 
spill containment and recovery, area 
surveillance, offshore firefighting, back flush 
capabilities, logistics supply duties, towing 
services and rescue operations in the  
area around the state of Kuwait, and in 
international waters.
Koc Al Zour also features dynamic positioning 
(DP) capability and is suitable for a variety of 
duties; for instance, when not undertaking tasks 
related to oil recovery, she can be put to work as 
an offshore support ship. 
The vessel is also designed to be on stand-by at 
sea for long periods. Both her hull shape and the 
optimised location of the anti-roll tanks are 
intended to ensure that the best possible 
seakeeping behaviour is achieved at all times.

ady Comeau III, which was built for Comeau Sea 
Foods of Nova Scotia, has an impressive range in 
excess of 5,500nm, enabling her to operate on 14- to 
21-day voyages with a crew of up to 31 persons. 
The vessel is being used to harvest scallops, and 
has the ability to freeze the catch immediately after 
arriving on deck, at -30°C. The vessel’s onboard 
processing factory uses cleaning, sorting and 
automated shucking technologies, and the end 
product is then sorted and stored in the refrigerated 
hold. Lady Comeau III also utilises a pair of side-
towed scallop rakes, with an optional third rake 
operated from the stern.
The refrigeration machinery recirculates the 
environmentally neutral refrigerant ammonia R717 
by pump, and is designed for semi-automatic 
operation. The refrigeration plant comprises two 
Sabroe and SAB 120 E screw compressor units, both 
equipped with frequency drives with manual and 
automatic VSD stepless capacity control from 100% 
to 10%,  governed by a UniSAB III computer 
mounted on each of the compressors. Builder 
Astilleros Armon says: “The computers interconnect 
to each other for optimal utilisation of the compressor 
capacity, and to optimise best possible performance 
and lowest possible power consumption.”
The main MaK engine has been fitted with an SCR 
system to meet IMO Tier III emissions requirements. 
The propeller was optimised for the vessel’s specific 
requirements when fishing, granting the boat “a tow 
force of three rakes, estimated to be approximately 
3,500kg line pull per rake,” the builder adds. Another 
notable feature is the ship’s WASSP multibeam sonar, 
which can be used to assess the composition of the 
seafloor when detecting areas rich in scallops.

020 saw the launch of Marell Boats' M15 Quad 
Outboard High-Speed Interceptor (M15Q), 
designed for high-speed interception missions 
and capable of cutting through the waves at 
speeds in excess of 60knots. 
The M15Q incorporates a “fine-tuned” version 
of Marell Boats’ M15 hull, adding four Mercury 
450hp (336kW) outboards to the arrangement. 
Designed for operations in conditions up to sea 
state 6, the vessel’s 8mm hull plate and longitudinal/
transversal framing were incorporated to prevent 
damage or buckling when the boat is subject to 
impacts in high seas. 
The four engines grant the boat a top speed of 
64knots when fully laden, and 67knots in 
lightship mode. Should five of these Mercury 
models be deployed, that lightship speed would 
increase to 70knots. Twin 900litre-capacity fuel 
tanks permit a range of 200nm, though this will 
depend on duty cycle.
The hull has a V-shaped bottom with hard 
chines. A canopy, fashioned in lightweight 
vacuum-moulded GRP, shields the crew area 
from the excesses of winter and summer weather, 
making the M15Q “suitable for both arctic and 
tropical conditions”, the company comments. 
The M15Q also meets the requirements of 
Lloyd’s Register’s (LR’s) Grey Boat Code, which 
was introduced in 2019 for naval and 
government-managed craft under 24m in length. 
The boat’s raised foredeck acts as a buffer 
against splashing and creates a stable platform for 
personnel when approaching and preparing to 
board other vessels. The lower aft deck serves as a 
multi-purpose platform that can be used to 
launch smaller craft (including rescue runners) 
for SAR tasks and/or provide a helicopter pick-up 
point for personnel. A centre-steering position 
was adopted to grant the helmsman maximum 
visibility when undertaking high-speed turns and 
intricate manoeuvres.
Marell Boats’ construction methodology 
includes fabricating the vessels in jigs to ensure 
straightness. The builder elaborates: “The jig 
frames forming the hull shape are precision-cut 
with the same waterjet cutting method as for the 
hull material. Also, cut-outs for the lifting strakes 
are made in the jig frames with the precision 
cutting machine, making the jig a base for a very 
accurate hull production of the bottom and sides 
of the craft, with possibility to build a number of 
hulls in the same jig to identical dimensions, and 
kept within very small tolerances.”
Once the deck girder structure has been created, 
sandwich composite deck panels are glued into 
place on the girder structure, to form a watertight 
bond. The deck panels also act as insulation against 
excessive solar radiation, thereby safeguarding hull 
integrity, especially in tropical and hot climates: 
the panels absorb any elongation of the aluminium 
plating, safeguarding the hull from deformation.
Sea trials were conducted in the Stockholm 
archipelago, including avoidance, U-turn and 
straight-line tests. Marell Boats comments: “As 
one example, the vessel [accelerated] from 
0-50knots in less than 12 seconds. All parties 
[were] very satisfied with the safe and stable 
platform and the performance results achieved 
with the strong moderate V-shaped bottom with 
hard chines and longitudinal strakes, which 
shows no tendencies of chine-tripping at full 
high-speed turns over 50knots.”

T
he Mayflower Autonomous Ship (MAS), or 
Mayflower 400, is an autonomous research 
trimaran whose genesis dates back to 2016, 
when ProMare founder Brett Phaneuf, a 
submarine builder and expert in underwater 
robotics, attended a meeting to discuss how  
to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the  
1620 voyage of Mayflower from Plymouth, UK  
to the US. 
Running on a combination of AI (which will 
effectively function as the vessel’s ‘captain’) and 
a mix of diesel and (predominantly) solar 
power, the MAS was launched in September 
2020 (the pandemic sadly muting some of the 
fanfare it deserved), representing not only an 
eye-catching example of innovative UK 
boatbuilding, but also a capable tool for 
collecting oceanic data, with the technology 
and build to undertake an Atlantic crossing. 
Featuring a long, slender hullform (to reduce 
the wet area), the vessel will be utilised by 
scientists and will work with other autonomous 
craft to analyse microplastic pollution, the 
effects of global warming and the impact on sea 
mammals – all with unlimited range. 
The AI ‘captain’ will assimilate data from 
various sources and constantly assess its route, 
status and mission. Onboard cameras and 
computer vision systems, meanwhile, will scan 
the horizon for potential hazards, while 
meteorological applications will check for 
dangerous storms, for instance. ProMare adds: 
“Machine learning and automation software 
ensure that decisions are safe and in-line with 
collision regulations.”
The vessel’s voyage, which will commence in 
April 2021, will be enhanced by an interactive 
web portal, allowing people to track its 
progress, including real-time updates on its 
current position and research data. The portal 
also features an octopus chatbot to provide this 
info in a lively format for browsers of all ages.

O
ne notable concept launched in 2020 was the 
Noé solar-panelled houseboat, a canal and 
maritime boat which could, in principle, be 
approved in sailing categories B and/or C. 
Adapted both to quayside living in a big city and 
to travel on canals and European rivers, Noé is 
intended to permit its owner to ‘lay anchor’ 
wherever he or she chooses. 
The 24m boat has been customised into seven 
sections - the wheelhouse, rear hold, living area, 
terraces, greenhouse, engine, and under-deck 
storage area. Noé  is built in natural materials and 
enables owners to produce their own energy, 
eliminating utility bills and reliance on water or 
electricity networks, while ensuring onboard 
heating, lighting, cooking and refrigeration 
facilities. An onboard greenhouse, designed by a 
permaculture specialist, will also allow owners to 
grow their own fresh produce. 
The hull has been constructed in Strongall, a 
zinc-galvanised thick aluminium which was 
selected for its sturdiness, to safeguard the boat in 
the event of an impact. SAS Noé adds: “Once 
covered with zinc, there is no further electrolysis 
in the water and no further chemical surface 
treatment on the inside or the outside of the hull. 
This avoids using polluting paint which gradually 
dissolves in the water. Recyclable, it also reduces 
the environmental footprint compared with steel 
or composite materials.” The material should also 
reduce the amount of time and cost required  
for maintenance. 
The ‘overhanging’ deck (the base for the 
separate wooden living area) conceals the 
technical part of the boat; its dimensions can be 
modified. The rear of the deck bears the 
wheelhouse and covers a garage area for a small 
city car, permitting the owner to hit the road 
when required.
The rear panel (with a fold-down option) can 
serve as a car turning area when loading or 
unloading it on the quayside by ramp or crane. 
The hull is fitted as standard with a single central 
rudder to limit vibration and, although there are 
no bow thrusters, this option exists.  Noé SAS 
adds: “The hull and deck assembly is the base for 
customisable configuration, making Noé 
adaptable as a boat, a living space, or a tool for 
semi-autonomous living.”

I
n builder Cemre’s own words, the combined fish 
factory and triple trawler Olympic Prawn was 
“designed to be safer for the crew, smarter for the 
operations, and greener for the environment” in an 
effort to get away from more traditional but ‘basic’ 
fishing vessels. 
Designed by Kongsberg to operate in harsh 
weather conditions, the ship will catch and process 
prawns and white fish in the Arctic, storing them 
within its 1,400m3 freezing hold.
An installed hybrid shaft generator enables 
operation at various rpms, and reduces fuel 
consumption. The IMO Tier III-compliant main 
engine and auxiliaries were supplied by Kongsberg. 
Olympic Prawn's accommodation area was designed 
in accordance with the hotel standards, for the 
welfare of the crew; for instance, the crew can access 
a comfortable day room and a galley with a well-
decorated mess room, serving 29 persons.  
Olympic Prawn features two wet areas. At the 
end of the day’s work, crew access these wet areas 
and leave their wet clothes for the dryers, which 
have the capacity to dry clothing in less than an 
hour. And, in case of accidents, the vessel also 
features an onboard hospital, fully equipped 
according to regulatory requirements, to look 
after injured fishermen until they reach a shore-
based medical facility.

T
he first in a series of at least three OSD-IMT 
7402 shallow-draught tugs, Patria 22 was 
delivered to PT Patria Maritime Lines, an operator 
based in Cikarang, Indonesia,  in  August 2020. 
The vessel was built at the Batam shipyard of PT 
Patria Maritim Perkasa, a subsidiary of PT United 
Tractors Pandu Engineering. 
The tug is equipped to assist 300’ (91.4m) 
barges when berthing and unberthing,  and to 
tow these barges along the 890km Barito River 
in the South Kalimantan area of Indonesia. 
During the dry season, the upstream part of the 
river has a water depth of only 2.5-3m, 
effectively restricting Patria 22’s  design 
draught  to 2m. 
The 23m tug is fitted with a 25tonne SWL 
towing hook, aft, alongside a 1tonne double 
gypsy anchor winch and a push bow triple 
vertical D-fender. This arrangement will also 
be applied to the vessel’s sisters. The design 
offers accommodation for 10 persons, arranged 
in two quadruple and two single cabins.
The tug is equipped with a pair of 610kW 
main diesel engines connected to drive shafts, 
and conventional fixed propellers with high-
efficiency nozzles. This configuration allows 
for an ahead bollard pull of 20tonnes and a free 
running speed of around 12knots. The boat is 
Indonesian-flagged and classed by Bureau 
Veritas. PT Patria Maritim Perkasa intends to 
build more OSD-IMT7402 tugs at a later date.

O
rdered to complement Japanese operator JR 
Kyushu Jet Ferry’s ‘Beetle’ ferry service, 
connecting Japan to South Korea, the new two-
deck, high-speed, all-aluminium Queen Beetle is 
tasked with shuttling up to 502 passengers per 
trip across the Tsushima Strait, linking Fukuoka, 
on the Japanese island of Kyushu, to Busan, in 
south-eastern Korea –  a route spanning 115nm. 
The vessel was constructed by Australian 
boatbuilder Austal at its Henderson South 
facility and constitutes Austal’s first newbuild 
for the Japanese transport company, which is a 
subsidiary of railway operator JR Kyushu. Queen 
Beetle is an all-new design, described as the 
Passenger Express 83, and Austal’s first 
passenger-only high-speed trimaran ferry, as 
well as Japan’s first high-speed trimaran ferry. 
Queen Beetle is fuelled by four MTU engines 
of the 16V 1163 M74 type. These drive a 
quartet of waterjets through ZF gearboxes, 
resulting in a speed of approximately 37knots 
at 85% MCR – though Austal says that the 
trimaran has achieved speeds of 40knots+ in 
sea trials. The trimaran can carry up to 
62,500litres of fuel. Queen Beetle also features: 
Austal’s proprietary MARINELINK monitoring 
and control system, providing real-time 
onboard and remote analysis of key vessel 
operating systems; and Austal’s MOTION 
CONTROL SYSTEM, comprising one active 
T-foil forward with two roll control foils aft, 
plus interceptors on the transom aft, for a ride 
with less motion and greater passenger and 
crew comfort in various sea states.
The ferry’s layout includes: two classes of 
seating, including compartments for groups and 
family; a children’s play area; a duty-free shop; 
and café and bar facilities. Austal says: “Seating 
includes luxuriously appointed reclining seats 
with footrests, personal reading lights, coat hooks 
and individual USB ports that allow mobile 
device charging. There are also group seating 
configurations available, with folding tables for 
families, plus unallocated lounge seating available 
for all guests to utilise during their journey.” 
Unlike previous newcomers to the fleet, Queen 
Beetle will not feature seatbelts, so as not to 
hamper passenger movement.
The vessel also provides lockers for luggage 
storage and all-access spaces for wheelchairs and 
prams. An outdoor viewing deck, meanwhile, will 
provide some variety during the crossing, and 
large panoramic windows are intended to grant 
passengers unobstructed views.
As well as potentially boosting the operator’s 
business, the Queen Beetle construction project was 
praised by Western Australia (WA) premier Mark 
McGowan as a significant achievement for the 
state’s maritime businesses. Austal estimates that 
getting the ferry off the blocks generated work for 
more than 200 people in WA. “The extent of the 
local content in this vessel is proof of both a vibrant 
shipbuilding industry in WA, as well as a testament 
to the quality of work and products that WA 
companies can contribute to the maritime sector, 
whether in civil or defence areas,” McGowan said.

T
he medium-speed monohull ferry Saoirse na 
Farraige (‘Freedom of the Sea’ in Gaelic) has 
the claimed honour of being the largest domestic 
passenger ferry in Ireland, featuring the capacity 
for up to 394 passengers. The vessel was built by 
Cheoy Lee Shipyards in China to a design 
supplied by BMT, and is tasked with carrying 
passengers to the Aran Islands, off the coast of 
Galway, Ireland. 
The vessel features a spacious main deck for 306 
passengers, divided into two seating areas; 
meanwhile, a semi-covered area on the top deck 
can accommodate 88 passengers. All-round crew 
visibility was a key consideration in the design of 
the wheelhouse. 
In addition to her capacity, Saoirse na Farraige 
has captured attention for her environmentally 
friendly assets. Sylvain Julien, BMT director of 
naval architecture, recalls: “This design is based 
on high-speed craft design paradigms with the 
aim of significantly reducing fuel consumption 
and, more generally, operating cost.” 
As such, the vessel was built out of lightweight 
aluminium, and attention was paid to realising a 
low displacement – deemed as key to achieving 
minimum installed power. Julien adds: “Despite 
the constraints associated with the use of 
aluminium for vessels that do not fall under 
IMO High Speed Craft [Code requirements], 
this construction material significantly improves 
the through-life cost of the vessel while reducing 
the day-to-day exhaust emissions thanks to [the] 
reduced power requirements.”
BMT developed a new double hard chine, semi-
displacement hullform for this particular project, 
taking into account the specific conditions that 
the ferry can expect to encounter on its route. 
This hullform was optimised for hydrodynamic 
efficiency and a high level of comfort. The ferry’s 
propulsion system comprises two Caterpillar C32 
diesel engines driving fixed-pitch propellers 
which, together with the newly developed BMT 
hullform, enable Saoirse na Farraige to hit speeds 
in excess of 20knots.

eacat Weatherly is the first next-generation 
Chartwell 24 catamaran designed by UK naval 
architect Chartwell Marine. The 24m catamaran was 
built at the Diverse Marine shipyard in Cowes, on the 
Isle of Wight, and has taken up its first charter 
contract at a major UK offshore wind project.
The vessel was developed by Chartwell Marine 
off the back of 10 years of offshore wind vessel 
design and experience, alongside extensive 
dialogue with high-profile stakeholders, 
including Seacat Services and various wind farm 
owners and turbine manufacturers. Consequently, 
the design was optimised for safety and passenger 
welfare, as well as technical availability – key 
metrics for offshore energy support vessel 
(OESV) performance.
To boost the vessel’s performance, the hull was 
constructed in aluminium, reducing weight and 
increasing load-bearing capabilities and 
performance. The vessel has an operational 
draught of 1.2m, delivering high levels of 
operational versatility.
Seacat Weatherly has been outfitted with two 
powerful MTU engines, enabling the vessel to 
reach speeds of up to 29knots. Combined with 
the optimised hullform, this is achieved while 
offering increased fuel economy.
In its capacity as an OESV, Seacat Weatherly can 
carry 24 industrial personnel, plus 3-6 crew 
members, out to offshore wind farms. Crucially, 
the vessel is outfitted to ensure maximum comfort 
for non-seafaring passengers, increasing levels of 
availability for turbine technicians. The vessel 
also has one of the largest foredecks on the 
market, increasing cargo-carrying capacity, and 
has been optimised for safety, with designated 
walkways, handrails and safety sliding rails 
positioned for safe, repeatable crew transfer. 
Safety is further enhanced by the catamaran’s 
‘step-free’ design, minimising trip hazards. 
Skippers benefit from a unique wheelhouse 
configuration that provides total control and 
complete visibility during complex logistical and 
crew transfer operations.
The vessel’s hull and engine configuration was 
designed to provide superior transit speed and 
manoeuvrability, alongside high bollard push and 
frictional holding force – both critical attributes for 
vessels ‘pushing on’ to offshore wind turbines and 
other infrastructure. Chartwell Marine adds: “This 
has all been achieved while making use of many of 
the same components and equipment as its sister 
vessels in the 14-strong Seacat Services fleet, in 
order to maintain operational familiarity and ensure 
effective management of spares and inventory.”

T
he TundRA 3600 ice-class tug Seaway Guardian 
has entered service with the Saint Lawrence 
Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC). The 
SLSDC is a wholly owned US government corporation 
tasked with operating and maintaining the 
St. Lawrence Seaway between Massena, NY and Lake 
Ontario, within the territorial limits of the US. 
The tug, which will be based in Massena, NY, will 
primarily operate between the Snell and Eisenhower 
locks with typical duties including icebreaking/ice-
management services, handling navigation aid buoys 
and pushing the SLSDC's buoy and gate lifter barges. 
The tug is also capable of secondary roles in fire-
fighting and pollution response. Built by Gulf Island 
Shipyards, LLC (GIS), the vessel was phased in to 
replace Robinson Bay, a 62-year old tug. 
The tug design is of relatively shallow draught, 
classed by ABS as an Ice Class 1A tug, and incorporates 
an ice-breaking bow form. It is powered by a pair of 
EPA Tier 4-compliant engines with after-treatment, 
delivering a bollard pull of 61lt (long tonnes) and a top 
speed exceeding 14knots via controllable-pitch Z-drive 
propulsion units. 
Seaway Guardian is equipped with a heavy-duty 
deck crane, a stern roller, shark jaws, and a tugger 
winch for ease of handling aids to navigation on the aft 
working deck. All equipment is rated for operating in 
the notoriously cold local winter conditions, and the 
decks feature a heat tracing system to reduce the 
accumulation of ice and improve the safety of crew 
operations on deck.
Barge winches and push knees on the forward deck, 
plus a towing winch within an enclosed house aft, 
allow the tug to handle barges off the bow or the 
stern. The elevated wheelhouse provides an enhanced 
view from the control position of the bow while 
pushing a barge ahead, and also the stern when 
handling aids to navigation.
The large aft deck, with wood sheathing and heavy-
duty cargo rails provides space for the SLSDC to 
handle and secure multiple navigational buoys, using 
its suite of buoy-handling equipment. A workboat 
stored on a cradle above the aft winch room can also 
be deployed by the crane as required.
Typical complement will be four to six crew; 
however, comfortable accommodations are provided 
for up to 14 persons for extended buoy run missions.

O
ver the past few years in Significant Small 
Ships, it’s been interesting to note those 
vessel entries that record ‘N/A’ for diesel fuel 
capacity; all-electric vessels, considered by many 
as something of a pipe dream a decade ago, have 
certainly demonstrated their capabilities when 
the technology is applied correctly.
Solar Eclipse is the first unit in builder Azura 
Marine’s Aquanima range of solar-powered 
catamarans, and a vessel completely self-sustained, 
as she harvests 100% of all energy used on board 
from the sun. Solar energy is captured by high-
efficiency solar panels covering most of the vessel’s 
55m2 roof, and is then distributed through the 
main voltage panels and stored in two large battery 
banks. The panels are “coupled with the best solar 
charging computers available, maximising the 
solar output at a rate of hundreds of calculations 
per second”, explains Azura Marine.
Powered by twin brushless DC motors, this 
vessel can cruise continuously, day and night, at 
an average speed of 4knots+. Azura Marine adds: 
“Daily energy harvests in excess of 55kWh have 
been recorded multiple times onboard Solar 
Eclipse, a remarkable figure for a 10kW peak roof 
around the equator. During summer, in higher/
lower latitudes, the yield would be even greater.”
The vessel’s full displacement hull shape was 
designed from scratch for solar energy and 
electric propulsion using CFD software run on 
supercomputers, enabling next-level design 
iteration and achieving ultra-low drag. The 
propellers were designed and manufactured 
specifically for high-torque, low-RPM  and ultra-
low losses. Maintenance-free electric motors were 
selected with an efficiency point as high as 98%, 
compared to a typical 35-40% for diesel engines, 
the builder states. 
The electrical architecture of Solar Eclipse and 
subsequent cats in the Aquanima range has marine 
and offshore DNA, thanks to her designer’s 
background: Julien Mélot was previously project 
manager at ASL Shipyard and responsible for the 
Swire ASD and Svitzer hybrid tugs, among other 
vessels. Z-Power Automation of Singapore 
manufactured and integrated the electric panels. 
As a result, the vessel has achieved full redundancy 
for the propulsion, plus 5 × redundancy for the 
batteries and 10  ×  redundancy for the solar-
panelled roof. “Solar Eclipse could lose entirely one 
of her two battery banks and still operate as 
normal,” Azura Marine adds.
Without any range limits nor pollution 
restrictions, the cat is able to explore remote areas 
without running out of power. Solar Eclipse has 
also been equipped with a dive compressor, a 
watermaker, air conditioning, a fridge, an ice 
maker, an induction stove and underwater lights. 
An electric tender, recharged from the mother 
vessel, can accommodate up to eight people for 
extending cruising in comfort and complete 
silence. Another big advantage is that there are no 
costs related to fuel, lube oil or propulsion-related 
maintenance.

D
escribed as one of the world’s most 
advanced fishing vessels, the factory 
freezer stern trawler Sunderøy  has been 
designed for triple trawl and pelagic trawl 
capabilities. The vessel’s speciality is catching 
white fish and shrimp within Arctic waters, 
particularly in the Barents Sea and the waters 
of Svalbard, and she has been optimised for 
bottom and mid-water trawling.
The 77.3m, ice-class Sunderøy was built in 
steel, with an aluminium superstructure, and 
incorporates modern and automated fish-
processing equipment, including a meal plant. 
The vessel has a total hold capacity of 2,250m3.
Sunderøy is intended to minimise her 
environmental footprint through selection of a 
wave-piercing hull design and a hybrid 
propulsion system, enabling the trawler to 
operate in diesel-electric or diesel-mechanical 
modes – or utilising both in combination.

T
he monohull landing craft Terror is one of two 
support craft carried aboard the UK-built, 
129m polar research ship RRS Sir David 
Attenborough, which commenced technical trials 
in November 2020 and which will conduct a range 
of scientific tasks, as well as supporting the 
resupply of the five Antarctic research stations 
operated by British Antarctic Survey. 
Terror, which was built by UK-based Coastal 
Workboats (formerly Exeter Fabrication), was 
designed for the transfer of food, vehicles, fuel 
and scientific equipment “to any location where 
the water is too shallow for the new polar ship to 
approach”, her designer, Incat Crowther, explains. 
The working deck can accommodate one 20’ 
container or a pair of 10’ containers, care of twist-
lock fittings and additional lashing points.
The craft also features a folding bow ramp and 
removable vehicle ramps, as well as a shallow 
forefoot for bow loading, with the vessel having 
been designed to load and accommodate a 
telehandler. A Heila HLM 10-2S deck crane can 
lift 2tonne loads to the cargo deck, while a kedge 
anchor and deck winch were selected to further 
enhance Terror’s overall functionality.
An elevated wheelhouse affords excellent 
visibility and accommodates three crew, in 
addition to the captain. She can accommodate an 
additional 12 personnel. Terror is powered by 
twin Doosan L086TIH main engines driving 
fixed-pitch propellers, and features robust skegs 
for protection, and this arrangement grants her a 
service speed of 9knots.

esigned to operate in one of the harshest 
environments in the far north of Norway, 
encountering 24 hours of darkness in winter, 
and snow, ice and storms from the North 
Atlantic, Thea Jensen has been described by 
builder Maritime Partner as the biggest 
ambulance boat operating in Norway. 
The boat is providing safe and reliable 
ambulance duties to a vast area in the Loppa, 
Hasfjord and outer Altafjord areas. As residents 
are spread out in these remote locations, cut off 
by fjords and mountains as well as weather 
restrictions, transport by road ambulances is 
not an option as it takes a much longer time to 
navigate the roads around the fjord, partly 
because the roads are impassable in winter. 
“Patients require the ambulance service to be 
stable, and here lies the design challenge that is 
solved with this boat,” Maritime Partner says.
The vessel has a unique hullform for 
operation in rough seas; its shape was designed 
for efficient movement through the water, to 
reduce fuel consumption. It is also fitted with 
foils supplied by Wavefoil, for a smooth ride 
and to contribute to fuel efficiency. The 
Wavefoils reduce the vertical accelerations by 
up to 25% on an already capable hull shape. 
The hull is also strengthened for ice and 
heating cables in large parts of the deck.
Other features include a functional platform, 
to pick up and treat patients in all kinds of 
weather, enabling the boat to make a safe 
passage to the hospital in Hammerfest all year 
round. Patients can board the boat at multiple 
levels, supported by an advanced lift 
arrangement, and the vessel can also support 
safe helicopter transfers. Thea Jensen hosts a 
spacious emergency room, with all the latest 
equipment for medical personnel, and a 
doctor’s office.
Maritime Partner adds: “The big challenge 
was to achieve a successful boat that can 
operate year-round way north of the polar 
circle. The seas in the area are very rough, with 
storms and polar nights a large part of the year. 
Hull shape and freeboard had to be optimal to 
ride out the storms, and the result is a very ‘dry’ 
boat which will help avoid spray and resulting 
icing in winter.”

aunched in 2020 as a concept vessel, VICTA 
is a revolutionary diver delivery unit 
(DDU), a surface/submersible craft designed to 
operate at speed over range and capable of 
transition beneath the surface to operate 
submerged, enabling the discreet delivery and 
recovery of divers. 
An innovative British product, VICTA is 
focused primarily on the defence market but 
with utility beyond that in the research and 
leisure sectors. The vessel is unique as it 
combines the characteristics of a long-range 
insertion craft with those of a swimmer 
delivery vehicle. It transitions rapidly from 
surface to subsurface, limiting exposure and 
reducing risk. The craft’s performance in both 
domains, and the transition between the two, is 
enabled by a fly-by-wire control system. 
A surface speed of 40knots and a range of 
250nm gives VICTA long and fast legs. Its 
subsurface performance is equally impressive 
with four hours endurance, sufficient to 
navigate fully submerged with two crew and six 
operators for 25nm. It should take approximately 
two minutes for VICTA to transition from 
surface to submersible operations, SubSea  
Craft estimates.
The close involvement of experienced 
operators in the design and ergonomic layout 
of the craft has resulted in a user-oriented 
solution that enables the delivery of mission-
ready capability over range. Also of note is an 
obstacle avoidance sonar, described as VICTA’s 
“eyes underwater”. The sonar builds a 3D 
impression of the seafloor out to 600m and 
down to 100m, to alert crew to any possible 
objects or traps. 
Compatibility with a standard ISO shipping 
container offers a range of deployment options: 
from a port of opportunity, through any surface 
vessel with appropriate crane capacity, through 
to movement within the cargo bay of a standard 
air-transport aircraft of carriage underslung 
from a standard heavy-lift helicopter. On 
arrival, the operators can simply rope or winch 
down to the craft. Alternatively, the craft can be 
embarked on the upper deck of a ship with the 
appropriate cranage or davits, allowing it to be 
introduced into the operating area directly 
from the deck.  
Finally, with 250nm endurance, VICTA is 
capable of independent transit into and from an 
area of operations – with additional fuel or a 
way-point re-fuelling option, this range can be 
extended significantly. Advanced materials, 
combined with minimal mechanical linkages 
and a digital thread – the bank of data – enables 
predictive and preventive maintenance to 
become part of routine equipment support. 
Maintenance, overhaul and repair are optimised 
by this digital diagnosis and, in turn, this 
increases availability and reduces cost.
