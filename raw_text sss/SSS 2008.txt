A
merica is the first of a new series of AZ/30 class of 
tug to enter service with Foss Maritime of Seattle. 
Constructed at JM Martinac shipbuilders of Tacoma, 
Washington and designed by Robert Allan, this vessel 
was built for Signet Maritime Corp of Houston, Texas 
and chartered to Foss. The vessel was designed to suit 
the operational requirements of the owner and the 
physical restrictions – primarily a limiting draught – of 
many US Gulf ports. The tug’s intended role was to 
provide conventional ship-handling and escort work, as 
well as rig-handling and short haul coastal towing. 
The vessel is powered by two MTU 16V-4000 diesel 
engines, each rated 2465kW at 2000rpm and each 
driving a Niigata model ZP-41 Z-drive with a 2700mm 
propeller through a hollow, in-line shafting system. This 
propulsion combination resulted in a bollard pull of 
80tonnes ahead, over 75tonnes astern and provided a 
free running speed of 14kts.
America is outfitted for a crew of up to six persons, in 
modern and well-equipped facilities. The master and 
chief engineer have large cabins on the main deck with 
a shared en-suite lavatory. The crew are accommodated 
in two double cabins on the lower deck. A spacious 
open-plan lounge and mess area dominates the main 
deck, served by a fully-equipped galley. An open 
breezeway and access corridor across the deckhouse 
enables all the interior accesses to be placed in a very 
sheltered location close to the centreline of the tug, and 
provides a full acoustic break between the exhaust 
casings and the accommodation.
The main hawser winch is a single drum, Markey 
model DEPCF-52S electric winch, with a line capacity 
of 230m of 80mm diameter synthetic towline, a brake 
capacity of 307tonnes and a line pull of 13,975kg at a 
speed of 22m/min or 3495kg at 44m/min.
The tug has a Fi-Fi 1 rating with two fire pumps 
driven via Power Take-Off drive shafts (PTO’s) on the 
front of the main engines.
Fendering comprises a Shibata 800mm OD cylindrical 
bow fender, above an array of Schuyler ‘soft-loop’ 
fenders which extend around the full length of the main 
deck.
The tug was built to ABS class with the notation   A1 
Towing Vessel,   AMS, Escort, Fi-Fi 1. Later in the year 
America was followed by her sister vessel Pacific Star.

A
stilleros Gondan of Asturias, Spain, has delivered 
the fourth of a series of escort tugs to be designed 
by Robert Allan Ltd for operator Solent Towage 
Limited of Southampton. Apex is a significant tug as 
the design was refined to integrate all previous results of 
‘in-operation’ experiences, according to Gondan. The 
time elapsed between the three previous deliveries was 
enough to let the shipowner operate and trial the 
previous tug of the series in real-time and therefore 
develop the improvements that later on were 
incorporated in Apex.
Apex is powered by Rolls-Royce Marine, Bergen diesel 
engines driving two Voith Schneider propellers. The 
vessel has an impressive bollard pull of 65 short tons, an 
operating speed of around 14kts a maximum speed of 
15kts.
Apex is classed by Det Norske Veritas (DNV) with the 
notation   1A1-Tug, EO, OILREC, FiFi1, Escort 
(130/10).
Apex follows her sister vessels Phenix, delivered to 
Solent Towage in December 2007, Tenax, delivered in 
2006 and Velox delivered in 2005.

P
T Batamec Shipyard has delivered the first in a 
series of powerful, anchor handling tug supply 
(AHTS) vessels, named Ark Tori. The AHTS vessel is a 
dynamic positioning system class 2 (DPS2) that has 
been built for owner All-RK Offshore (formerly 
Allocean) to add to its existing diverse fleet of vessels.  
Despite being designed to provide a bollard pull of 
120tonnes, the vessel is actually capable of an impressive 
bollard pull of 140tonnes. This is made possible by the 
provision of a pair of Wärtsilä 8L32 main engines, each 
outputting 4000kW of power at 750rpm to a Wärtsilä 
Propulsion controllable pitch propeller enclosed in a 
Kort nozzle. High-performance streamline rudders 
behind each nozzle are provided by Becker to provide 
Ark Tori with the level of manoeuvrability required to 
operate in her role of offshore support vessel.
Ark Tori has a large wheelhouse enclosed by windows 
to provide 360o vision for the master and is fitted with 
both forward and aft control stations to optimise vessel 
control once in anchor handling and towing modes. 
The vessel is outfitted with Rolls-Royce Marine 
Brattvaag winches and an anchor windlass on deck. Her 
primary towing winch is located aft of the superstructure 
on the main deck. The main winch works in conjunction 
with the tow pins and shark jaw over the vessel’s 
4m-long stern roller and is backed up by a pair of 
capstans and two tugger winches.

F
ollowing an international tender in 2007, Safehaven 
Marine, builders of the Interceptor range of Pilot 
Boats were awarded the contract to supply an all 
weather pilot boat to the Port of Sines in Portugal. 
Safehaven’s new pilot Interceptor 55, Atlantida Azul, 
was chosen. The vessel is a 16m pilot boat based on 
Safehaven’s successful Interceptor 42 pilot boat, 
featuring the same ‘Deep-V’ twin chine hull that 
provides excellent performance and seakeeping.
The Interceptor 55 was decided upon following the 
success of the first of class Interceptor 55, a patrol/
passenger vessel Orca II, and now operating successfully 
off the west coast of Scotland for her owner, Angus 
Campbell. Campbell has said about the vessel: ‘We are 
very happy with the new vessels performance and her 
seakeeping, having been out in up to 35kts of wind in 
her I can find no fault in her abilities and look forward 
to continuing the St Kilda run in her over the coming 
year.’
The Port of Sines vessel differs in being of heavier 
build and displacement, and having an aft configuration 
of wheelhouse, Safehaven’s modular mould design 
allows the vessel to have several different configurations 
to suit the vessels intended operational requirement, 
with the design being fully customisable. The vessel is 
powered by Scania’s D16 V8 engines rated at 650hp 
running through Twin Disc 5114 quick shift gearboxes, 
and with stern gear comprising 58mm F51 Duplex 
shafts turning 28” 4 blade props supplied by Clements 
Engineering.  She has an operational speed of 25kts on 
a 24,500kg displacement. Atlantida Azul has very low 
noise levels, with readings recorded in the wheelhouse 
of only 76db at 25kts, such noise levels were previously 
the realm of expensive and complicated isolated 
wheelhouse, but Safehaven paid special attention to the 
engineroom’s soundproofing, resulting in the crew and 
pilots’ relaxed, quiet and vibration-free working 
environment.
Heavy duty rubber fendering supplied by Avon 
Rubber protects the hull with substantial 150 x 200mm 
fendering along her gunwale with numerous diagonals 
and a lower run along her 2nd chine just above the 
waterline, her bow is rounded allowing the fender to 
wrap around the bow in a continuous run.
Atlantida Azul’s pilot boarding area is wide, spacious 
and uncluttered providing a safe working area for pilot 
and crew who both benefit from her raised sheerline 
and flared bow, keeping decks dry and safe.
The vessel has a very high level of fit out throughout 
the craft with the large wheelhouse providing enough 
space to allow the combination of a standard six-pilot 
seating arrangement on CAB hydraulic sprung seats, 
with a VIP area in the aft section of the cabin, 
comprising a very comfortable six-person seating dinette 
with a table and a 6ft worktop opposite with substantial 
locker space incorporated. All internal furnishings are 
from walnut effect laminate, white headlining and grey 
sidelining providing a warm, high quality yet practical 
environment. 
However one of the main advantages of Safehaven’s 
design is the huge forward accommodation area allowed 
by placing the engines centrally under the wheelhouse. 
Forward there is sleeping accommodation afforded by 
traditional V berths combined with large bunk berths. 
A comfortable seating area along side the large galley 
area, a full size heads compartment with sink, grey waste 
management with holding tanks. Large wet lockers and 
under deck storage enhance her functionality and 
provides a very comfortable crew environment 
From an operational perspective, a centrally positioned 
helm position provides her coxswain with clear 
uninterrupted vision equally to port and starboard, 
large side and overhead windows, all double glazed to 
prevent misting assist visibility when alongside ships. 
Her helm position has been especially designed to 
provide a focused and ergonomically efficient operators 
environment, which allows the coxswain to take full 
advantage of the Interceptors fine responsive handling. 
Typically, which is the case with all Safehaven’s craft, her 
seakeeping is exceptional. Demonstration seakeeping 
videos undertaken in full gale force 8 conditions amply 
displayed their confidence in her abilities. Safe and 
controllable running downwind, stable beam on and 
very soft punching into steep head seas are the 
Interceptors trademark.
She will be delivered by sea to Portugal in January 
across the Bay of Biscay, in itself a daunting prospect 
during which her crew will no doubt appreciate her sea 
keeping abilities.

aspian Breeze is the second of Damen’s ‘Sea Axe’ 
Fast Crew Supplier 3507 (FCS 3507) vessels to be 
delivered in 2008. After successful sea trials the vessel 
was handed over to the customer and commenced her 
maiden voyage to Azerbaijan. Caspian Breeze will 
operate for BP in the Caspian Sea region and in 
addition to her crew and supply duties, is also equipped 
with a small hospital for emergency duties.
The hull-form of this ship is based on the renowned 
axe bow concept. The idea for the concept is based on 
an extreme deep and high flair-less bow, which gives the 
boat unparalleled ‘soft’ vertical accelerations. In 
co-operation with the Royal Netherlands Navy, US 
Coast Guard, Maritime Research Institute Netherlands 
(MARIN) Wageningen and Damen, a significant 
research project was carried out to ascertain the 
feasibility of this principle. On finalising the project, 
Damen has decided to apply the Sea Axe hull-form for 
a series of Fast Crew Suppliers.
The 35m loa FCS 3507 is technically very similar to 
the two metre smaller Damen ‘Sea Axe’ Fast Crew 
Supplier 3307, the first ship type for which Damen 
chose to apply the axe bow concept. Contrary to her 
smaller sister, the FCS 3507 is designed more as a fast 
supplier than as a crew boat. The FCS 3507 is built 
completely from aluminium.
As of November 2008, two additional ‘Sea Axe’ Fast 
Crew Suppliers 3507 are under construction in The 
Netherlands.

on Osiris is the second of Damen’s ‘Sea Axe’ Fast 
Crew Supplier 5009 series, built for the Mexican 
offshore operator, Naviera Integral SA de CV.
The remarkable hull-form of Don Osiris is based on 
the well known axe bow concept, an innovation from 
associate professor Lex Keuning of Delft University of 
Technology. The idea is based on an extreme deep and 
high flair-less bow, which gives the vessel unparalleled 
soft vertical accelerations. 
In co-operation with the Royal Netherlands Navy, US 
Coast Guard, Marin Wageningen and Damen, a 
significant research project was carried out to ascertain 
the feasibility of this principle. After finalizing this 
project, Damen decided to apply the ‘Sea Axe’ hull-
form for the whole series of fast crew suppliers. 
The 50m loa ‘Sea Axe’ Fast Crew Supplier 5009 is the 
largest of the Damen ‘Sea Axe’ Fast Crew Suppliers to 
date. Originally the vessel was meant to be built entirely 
out of aluminium, but extensive fatigue calculations 
showed that aluminium was not the right material for a 
ship of this size and usage. For this reason, the shipyard 
decided upon a steel hull, up to the main deck and an 
aluminium superstructure.
As of the end of November 2008, fifteen more ‘Sea 
Axe’ Fast Crew Suppliers 5009 are under construction 
in Vietnam, Indonesia and The Netherlands.

W
ang Tak Engineering & Shipbuilding Co Ltd of 
Hong Kong, along with subsidiary company 
Guangdong Hongshen Shipbuilding & Engineering 
Co Ltd, have recently delivered an exciting new 
passenger ferry for passenger and cargo transportation 
company, Shanghai Yatong Shipping Co. Ltd.
Dong Hai Lu Dao features the popular seaspeed “Deep 
V” seacat hull and is a high passenger capacity commuter 
ferry for Shanghai waterways. The vessel has a capacity 
for around 300 passengers on the lower deck with a 
comfortable seating arrangement and extra-wide 
walkways. The area has a large servery/bar area and the 
wash rooms are located away from the seating. The 
upper deck has capacity for around 100 VIP passengers 
in a spacious saloon with three separate exclusive lounge 
rooms and boardrooms featuring flat-screen televisions 
and music systems.
Powered by a combination of twin MTU 12V 4000 
engines (1740kW) and MJP 650 waterjets, Dong Hai 
Lu Dao has a predicted fully-loaded speed of over 30 
knots. 
Wang Tak has been concentrating on the mid-speed, 
high performance and fuel economy segment of the 
market in the 25-35kt speed range. It appeals to the 
economical operator with lower capital costs due to 
smaller engines and propulsion systems, low operating 
costs and low emissions whilst operating. The 
environmental impact of operating the vessel is very low 
per passenger nautical mile. 
The standard of construction of Wang Tak vessels is 
high and to CCS (China Classification Society) LR 
(Lloyds Register) or other international standards. In 
this instance Dong Hai Lu Dao is classed by China 
Classification Society, but the notation is, at the time of 
writing, unknown.

snaad 710 is the first vessel built by Astilleros 
Balenciaga for its customer Esnaad, which means 
“support” in Arabic. Esnaad provides support vessels for 
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), United 
Arab Emirates, and other offshore oil companies.
Balenciaga secured the contract to build a field control 
vessel (FCV) for Esnaad in early 2006 as part of an 
international tender. Esnaad 710 will perform multiple 
tasks in one of the oilfields offshore Abu Dhabi for 
vessel operator Zakum Development Company. The 
duties include traffic control, supply, standby-rescue, 
fire-fighting, and towing and oil spill response 
operations. 
Design concept work was undertaken by Vik-Sandvik 
and the vessel was given the design number VS457 and 
features a low freeboard of the main deck aft, to facilitate 
rescue operations. The freeboard forward has also been 
kept relatively low, with a prominent bulbous bow to 
enhance the speed performance of the vessel. The 
decision to make the freeboard forward low is because 
of the generally gentle weather conditions encountered 
in the Arabian Gulf.
The vessel is driven by four Caterpillar 3516B main 
engines, each developing 1,491kW at 1800rpm. Each 
pair of engines drives a Finnoy CP propulsion system 
with ducted propellers, through their two-in-one-out 
gearbox, with one engine fitted on the forward side of 
the gearbox and the other aft. Both forward engines are 
arranged for running the fire-fighting pumps, via a 
clutch, and the aft engines are direct-coupled to shaft 
generators. During sea trials the vessel achieved a 
maximum speed of 14.5kts.  
Esnaad 710 has a Schottel transverse thruster of 
600kW at the fore of the vessel and aft there is a tunnel 
thruster of 400kW.

olombo Dockyard PLC delivered Greatship Anjali for 
Greatship (India) Limited (GIL) early in 2008. GIL 
is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of India’s largest 
private sector shipping companies, the Great Eastern 
Shipping Company. GIL is in the business of providing 
offshore oil field services catering to the oil and gas E&P 
domain.
Anchor handling tug supply vessels like Greatship Anjali 
have the capability of towing and fire-fighting, as well as 
that of supplying cargo to the offshore installations situated 
worldwide. Greatship Anjali will be the pride of Sri Lanka 
as she will bear the Sri Lankan signature amongst a large 
fleet of vessels operating in the oil and gas fields in the 
world. 
The attractive and purposeful vessel design was developed 
by Moss Maritime AS of Finland, a world renowned ship 
designing company having expertise and experience in the 
field of designing vessels, platforms and floaters used by the 
offshore industry.

and cost effective operation for the vessel.
The all important towing/anchor handling winch of 
brake holding capacity of 250tonnes and the deck 
machinery package inclusive of a 15T tugger winch, 10T 
capstan, and 300T stern roller for the vessel is from 
Norcrane & Winch from Norway.   
HRP Thrusters provided the two HRP 4000 electric 
driven bow thrusters of a 500kW capacity which will each 
provide the necessary side thrust for manoeuvring, station 
keeping and Dynamic Positioning (DP) operations. 
The bulk handling system is a compact and efficient 
design using the latest technology of Norwegian origin 
from Van Aalst Marine & Offshore and is also equipped 
with an external fire fighting system with water and foam 
monitors installed to class FiFi-1. 
The vessel has a clear deck area of 440m² capable of 
carrying 900t of deck cargo, plus substantial tank capacities 
for the typical liquid and dry bulk cargoes required by 
offshore platforms.  
Well equipped wheelhouse shall provide excellent 
visibility to the horizon as well as over the aft working 
deck. Navigation and communication electronic 
equipment has been predominately supplied by European 
manufacturers.

G
reat Lakes Shipyard along with designers Jensen 
Maritime Consultants have delivered the first of a 
series of ‘Handysize’ tugs for operator Tugz International. 
The vessel Handy One has some interesting features that 
make her stand out from other tugs on the market today. 
The vessel is made of steel to ABS “ice-class” hull standard 
for sturdiness and icebreaking, if applicable, the increased 
½-inch steel thickness and tighter framing in the bow and 
stern ensures an increase in the tug’s overall operating life.
The sea trials, including speed and endurance trials were 
performed in the icy waters of Lake Erie under freezing 
winter conditions. The trials exceeded design and 
manoeuvring expectations and the tug at full speed was 
able to stop in its own length.
Designed to fill the niche between the 2,800-3,200hp 
tug market for harbour work, fireboats, and construction 
operations as well as for coastal towing, Handy One is 
described as being the right size, the right power, 
environmentally sound, fuel efficient and versatile enough 
to accomplish most tug jobs at the lowest operating cost.
Handy One meets all US Coast Guard regulatory 
requirements and is classed by ABS with the notation  
ABS    A1, Towing Vessel, AMS. A loadline certificate is 
not required. 
Measuring 22.6m loa with a moulded beam of 9.1m and 
a maximum draught of 3.3m the tug attains a bollard pull 
of  36t and a free running speed of 12kts from a pair of 
Cummins QSK 38 diesels each developing 1,400hp at 
1,800 revolutions/minute. These turn 72.0” diameter 
Kaplan type propellers inside Type 37 stainless steel lined 
nozzles and Twin Disk MG 540 with 5.17:1 ratios. A pair 
of 65kW generator sets provides the electrical needs while 
the standard 2,000gpm fire pump, which feeds a single 
forward deckhouse-mounted monitor, is driven off one of 
the generator engines.  Additional fire monitors and foam 
capability for a fireboat version of the tug are available as an 
option.  Keel coolers provide a saltwater-free engine room. 
Ahead of a well insulated forward bulkhead are two twin-
bunk crew cabins and a laundry. On the main deck, a 
single cabin for the captain with an additional Pullman’s 
berth is located on the starboard side of the deckhouse aft 
of the mess room, and a toilet/shower room is located port 
side aft.  All of the accommodations onboard the vessel are 
air-conditioned.
There is a full walk-around bridge deck with steps up 
from main deck, fore and aft.  One central door aft and 
internal staircase gives access to the traditionally laid out 
wheelhouse.  Eleven windows and three lower windows 
forward provide 360° view.  The exhaust casings are cut off 
at waist height to ensure good visibility.  Amongst an 
impressive array of wheelhouse electronics is a pair of radar 
units, a GPS, autopilot, digital and magnetic compasses, 
and an optional Techsol engine room monitoring and 
alarm system.  A unique feature of the design is that the 
steel structure and deck have been strengthened to 
accommodate a range of customer requirements which can 
be installed at the time of construction or later, without 
need of performing major steel work.  These options 
include a forward hawser winch, an aft towing winch, and 
a knuckle boom crane.
The Handysize tug is designed for seven-to-ten day’s 
endurance for coastal service and the tank capacities 
include 25,340 gallons of fuel and 1,855 gallons of potable 
water.

P
olish ship repair yard Remontowa SA delivered a 
fully UK MCA-compliant fisheries protection vessel 
to the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency on 12 May 
2008. 
The primary function of FPV Hirta is fishery 
protection in waters surrounding the mainland and 
islands of Scotland, operating throughout the patrol 
area in all four seasons. The vessel is powered by three 
1630kWm generators, two 2000kWe propulsion 
motors, one 296kWe auxiliary/harbour generator and 
99kWe emergency diesel generator. 
FPV Hirta is capable of operating at variable speeds 
from zero to 18knots. The normal cruising speed is 
12knots and the vessel is capable of continuous 
independent operation at this speed for a period of 30 
days. This timescale takes into account the normal 
seagoing electrical load that the vessel will carry. 
Hirta carries two rigid inflatable boats of 7.5m each, 
handled by Ned-Deck davits with anti-pendulation 
head and fully-compensating lift winch.
Built to merchant vessel specifications, FPV Hirta has 
no military construction or high specification navigation 
and communications equipment onboard. Hirta is 
fitted with normal GMDSS radio and satellite 
communications equipment.
The vessel has an expected minimum service life of 25 
years and will achieve maximum efficiency for boarding 
boat operations with the deck arrangement, stability, 
and seakeeping properties optimised and co-ordinated 
to provide a safe working platform in conditions up to 
Beaufort wind force 6 (Sea-State 5-6).
FPV Hirta is constructed under survey to Lloyd’s 
Register Classification to obtain the notation +100A1, 
LMC, UMS, CAC, EP, SCM – Fisheries Protection 
Vessel.

liria is the first of a series of four Damen Stan Patrol 
4207 vessels for the Albanian Coast Guard/Navy. Iliria 
was built in The Netherlands, but her three sister vessels 
will be built locally by Damen Technical Co-operation at 
the Pashaliman yard in South Albania.
Iliria was named on the 8th of August by Mrs. 
Zhaneta Gerveni, spouse of the commander of the 
Albanian Navy Capt (N) Kris Gerveni.
Soon after Iliria’s naming ceremony she sailed to 
Albania where she arrived at the port of Durres to start 
her operations. Iliria will perform patrol as well as SAR 
duties along the Albanian coast line.
Based on the successful Damen standard, the vessel 
was delivered within nine months after the contract was 
signed. 
Three successive vessels will be built in Albania in 
combination with local yard rehabilitation out of a 
Damen Technical Co-operation (DTC) material 
package.
The Damen Stan Patrol 4207 is a 42m patrol boat, 
designed to the “Enlarged Ship Concept” for superior 
seakeeping performance. Damen has delivered similar 
series of the ships to The Coastguard of the Netherlands 
Antilles & Aruba, UK Revenue & Customs, Netherlands 
Coast Guard, Vinamarine of Vietnam, Jamaica Defence 
Force – Coast Guard and Barbados Coast Guard. At the 
moment (November 2008), nine more Damen Stan 
Patrols 4207 are under construction in Albania and The 
Netherlands.

A
lthough slightly larger than most of the vessels 
featured in Significant Small Ships, Island Constructor 
is the fourth vessel in a popular series of Ulstein’s X-bow 
design and warrants inclusion in the publication for its 
innovative design. The design concept aims to lower 
the vessel’s impact on the environment and make it 
safer to operate in extreme weather conditions. The 
bow shape also allows the vessel to maintain optimum 
speed whilst saving fuel at the same time. The Ulstein 
SX121-class ship was designed by Ulstein Design AS 
and constructed at Ulstein Verft AS. 
Island Constructor was built to meet a growing need in 
the market for a vessel with light well intervention 
technology. Traditionally oil recovery from subsea wells 
is undertaken by drilling rigs, but since the introduction 
of light well intervention technology, mono-hull vessels 
are now able to complete this type of operation.  
The vessel is powered by two Rolls-Royce main 
generator engines, has two main azimuth propellers and 
two bow tunnel thrusters of controllable pitch. The 
vessel features dynamic positioning 3 (DYN POS), 
which allows for a high level of security against loss of 
power. The vessel is incredibly quiet, as attested by its 
DNV Comfort (C3) (V3) classification.
Island Constructor is also noteworthy for being the 
first vessel with the new IP-based Ulstein COM 
communications system from Ulstein Elektro, and is 
the first vessel to be equipped to the new Ulstein 
Accommodation Standard, the intention of which is to 
create more modern accommodation on board, of a 
type that meets the expectations of a new generation of 
seafarers.

N
orwegian shipyard Aker Yards Langsten (now part 
of STX Europe) has delivered Island Wellserver, an 
award-winning offshore service vessel to her owner 
Island Offshore Management AS. The vessel achieved 
the status ‘Ship of the Year’ at the SMM 2008 
exhibition in Hamburg in September 2008.
Although this vessel is slightly larger than the vessels 
generally covered in Significant Small Ships, its 
‘uniqueness’ makes it a significant vessel to include.
Island Wellserver is a subsea, riserless, oil and gas well 
intervention vessel that has introduced new standards 
for working environment, safety and comfort. 
This newbuild was constructed to fill the gap in the 
subsea well intervention market, which is predominantly 
served by drilling rigs after the suggestion that 
alternatively a vessel could serve the market.
The Norwegian State Secretary, Rikke Lind, who 
presented the ‘Ship of the Year’ award at SMM, said: 
"The vessel is a masterpiece in Norwegian shipbuilding 
and reflects the high market demands in the booming 
sector of ship based light well intervention services".
Described as a subsea riserless well intervention vessel 
with a running wire line through a subsea lubricator 
system, she is equipped with the most advanced systems 
available. Island Wellserver will perform production 
logging, plugging and gauging operations, re-perforations 
and down-hole mechanical works.
The vessel is built in compliance with the Norwegian 
Maritime Directorate’s and Norsok’s regulations for 
mobile offshore units, i.e. the same regulations as used for 
production vessels, rigs and platforms operating at the 
Norwegian continental shelf. 
Island Wellserver has been built to the highest DNV 
Comfort Class notation; she has a noise and vibration 
level similar to a modern cruise ship. This makes her the 
world's only offshore vessel with DNV's highest Comfort 
Class, V (1) C (1). The HSE philosophy is an important 
aspect for the ship owning company who aims to give the 
crew the best living and working environment possible.
The prestigious Ship of the Year-award is instituted by 
the Norwegian shipping magazine Skipsrevyen.

ockstavarvet AB has a long history of aluminium 
boat-building, specialising in two areas – high 
speed police/patrol/interceptor craft and fast pilot 
launches. Yard number 551, known as LOS 116, is a 
new vessel in the shipbuilder’s repertoire and was built 
for the Norwegian Coastal Administration Fedje Pilot 
Station outside Bergen. 
LOS 116 is developed from a concept worked out by 
the Norwegian Coastal Administration based on a series 
of existing twin-screw pilot boats. The 16.8 x 5.2m hull 
is proven as a reliable heavy-weather boat and remains 
unchanged except that the detailed engineering has 
been upgraded to the highest current standards. The 
boat is of an all-welded aluminium construction and 
built according to Det Norske Veritas/Norwegian 
Maritime Directorate classifications. The resiliently 
mounted deckhouse is fitted with a Pilot/Co-Pilot 
‘conning’ arrangement, toilet, pantry, and seating for up 
to 8 Pilots. The noise level inside is extremely low, 
reaching only 61dbA at full speed and well below the 
65dbA required by current legislation.
The vessel is fitted with a twin-screw propulsion 
system from MTU/SwedMotor, consisting of 8V2000 
main engines, Servogear gears/CPPs and Blue Vision 
electronic manoeuvring/monitoring systems. With a 
rating of 2 x 720kW this system gives a service speed of 
27kts and very smooth manoeuvring. The navigation 
and communications equipment is delivered by ProNav/
JRC and includes JMA-5310 and JMA-5210 black-box 
radars, JHS-182 AIS, NCR-333 Navtex, FF-50 
echosounder, CSI Vector PRO GPS compass, Northstar 
MX500 DGPS, Simrad AP-50 autopilot, Maris AEC-
6910 chart system and one 19 plus two 17inch 
interconnect able flat-screens from Hatteland. For the 
pilots, an additional 15inch screen plus a pilot-plug is 
provided to give access to situational awareness before 
boarding. Two Sailor RT-5022 stations are included in 
the GMDSS A1 package.
The west coast of Norway is an extremely weather-
hard area and calls for heavy-duty fendering. LOS 116 
has been fitted with the bolted truck-tyre system used 
on all Dockstavarvet pilot boats delivered within the last 
15 years. The system provides good protection for the 
vessel and low maintenance costs. In addition to the 
normal safety equipment, LOS 116 is also fitted with a 
comprehensive heating system to keep decks, boarding 
platforms and handrails free from ice in below zero 
conditions.
The Norwegian Coastal Administration has an option 
for five additional units of this highly specialised pilot 
craft.

U
nion Naval Valencia (UNV) has delivered the first 
vessel in a series of four salvage tugs for SASEMAR, 
the Spanish Maritime Salvage Agency belonging to the 
Spanish Government. Maria de Maeztu has been 
specially designed to carry out rescue, towing and fire-
fighting operations along the Spanish coasts. 
The tug can also accommodate survivors in a separate 
room onboard and can assist recovery oil ships during 
operation against the spills. She is also designed to give 
support for rescue operations.
Maria de Maeztu is propelled by azimuth propulsion 
and the maneuverability with reduced speed is very 
good and has been improved by means of a 200 kW 
bow thruster. 
The vessel is also fitted with Fire Fighting Ship 1 
Water Spray (FIFI 1) equipment.
The construction and profile of Maria de Maeztu and 
her sister vessels is based on the typical concept of 
salvage tugs with fore and aft towing winches and 
forecastle/bulwark to operate in rough seas.
The aft deck, working deck is capable of accommodate 
two 20ft containers in case of need and in each side the 
tugs have rescue doors of suitable dimensions.
Maria de Maeztu is fitted with a work and rescue boat 
from maritime partner Weedo 710. This 7.10m loa 
boat, classified also as rescue boat, has a bollard pull of 
2tons, beam of 2.93m, and is of explosion proof 
construction with GRP with protection cabinet, fenders 
around. The work and rescue boat is powered by a 
Volvo Penta diesel D5ATA engine of 160hp at 2300rpm 
with reduction gear ZF IRM 220 and protected three-
blade propeller in stainless steel. The work boat also has 
navigation lights and search projector, a battery charger 
transformer at 230V/42V and a Dacon RG10 rescue 
net. To assist the launching of the workboat, a hydraulic 
boom supplied by Hydramarine is fitted forward.
Forward PTO in each of the main engines is for one 
AC shaft generator of 500 kVA and one FI-FI1 pump of 
1500 m³/h. The propellers and bow thruster are 
individually controlled and also have integrated control 
by Schottel Masterstick.
Accommodation onboard Maria de Maeztu is for 12 
persons. There are two cabins with separate office and 
toilet for the captain and chief engineer, eight individual 
cabins with toilet, one double cabin with toilet, a mess 
room for the crew, a mess room for the officers, rescue 
room with two Pullman beds and toilet and a 
multipurpose room with four Pullman beds, an office 
and galley with provisions stores. 
Maria de Maeztu’s sister vessels are scheduled to be 
delivered at regular intervals.

M
essico is the first in series of a new class of tug 
designated AVT 36/70 E by designer Robert 
Allan Ltd and is the first of a pair of near identical tugs 
to be constructed by shipbuilder Astilleros Armon in 
Navia, Spain.
The vessel has been classed by Italian classification 
society RINa and is suitable for a wide range of duties 
including harbour towage and ship-handling, coastal 
towing, salvage and escort operations, fire-fighting and 
oil spill response.  
On sea trials Messico achieved a mean bollard pull of 
82.7tonnes, a maximum bollard pull of 86.33tonnes 
and a free running speed of 13.96kts.
Messico features a large aft deck to facilitate oil 
recovery operations and oil dispersant spray capabilities. 
The design features a fully raised forecastle to provide a 
high standard of accommodation and the best possible 
sea-keeping capability for operation in exposed 
conditions. 
Outfitting is of a high standard for a crew of up to 14 
persons. Main deck accommodations include three 
two-person cabins, four one-person cabins, a galley, 
mess, galley stores, workshop, oil lab, and locker room/
lobby and deck store. The deckhouse at forecastle deck 
level includes four one-person officer cabins. The 
wheelhouse features a single control station providing 
maximum visibility to both fore and aft deck working 
areas. Noise levels throughout the accommodation are 
in the vicinity of 60dBa, achieved by utilised advanced 
methods of isolating main propulsion machinery, as 
well as high-grade insulations and floating floor 
techniques. 
Main propulsion for the vessel comprises two MaK 
8M25 diesel engines, each rated 2640kW at 750rpm, 
and each driving a Voith model 32R5-265-2 cycloidal 
propeller. The indirect escort steering force is estimated 
at 117tonnes at 10kts.
The towing winch is a ‘waterfall-style’ double drum 
type, in which the upper drum contains 1000m of 
56mm steel wire towline. The upper drum has a 
spooling device directly driven by the drum. The lower 
drum is split, with a 250m synthetic hawser for 
escorting, and a 150m synthetic line for harbour towing. 
1000m of spare 56mm towline is stored below deck in 
the ship’s hold on a hydraulically powered reel.
Towing flexibility is achieved with a radial arm tow 
hook. Salvage and general stores/deck operations are 
aided by a 25tonne-metre knuckle boom crane. Fenders 
at the stern (skeg end) comprise a 900 x 450 cylindrical 
fender above a row of 450mm “W” block fenders. A 
300 x 300 hollow “D” fender provides protection at the 
main and forecastle deck sheer lines, and “W” block 
type fendering is used again at the bow.
One of the most significant details about Messico is 
that it features significant noise and vibration 
dampening treatments and has received RINa’s notations 
COMF-NOISE C and COMF-VIB C, making it the 
first vessel under 65m to receive these notations.

M
/Y Sea Force One, the first ‘Admiral-54’ vessel, 
stands out in the international panorama as being 
a yacht in which the strong personality of the ship 
owner and his desire for ‘uniqueness’ accompanied 
every step of the designing and building phases. 
The ship looks aggressive right from the start with its 
shiny black hull and imposing silhouette, but the lateral 
rounding off of the silver grey superstructure make it 
sinuous and aesthetically pleasing. 
The ship is decorated with doors equipped with 
platforms with hydraulic opening which lower down to 
create real balconies. One is at the level of the main hall 
and thanks to a royal staircase that connects it to the 
water, it becomes an access way for guests, the other two 
are in the ship owner’s cabin. The lighting architecture, 
a signature feature of the entire ship includes strip 
lighting under the hull; beams of light projected from 
the walls or the main deck give it a unique night 
visibility and create special effects around the ship.   
The vessel’s interiors and facilities are particularly 
innovative. Fiber optic illuminations have been installed 
everywhere and the designers were able to recreate the 
design of water on the Plexiglas of the stairway in the 
foyer. 
The internal wall is entirely made of white leather and 
opens up in a black leather oval shape to hold a sofa. 
Just a few steps lead down to the owner’s cabin: the 
front stem wall is an incredible work of blue fluorescent 
paint on black velvet that in the dark represents ‘a 
galaxy’. Two symmetrical platforms with hydraulic 
opening open to create two exclusive balconies right 
onto the sea. The bathroom has a shower and tub made 
of pietra luna slate, whereas the wall and the cabinets 
are made with broken mirror mosaic pieces. 
On the lower deck, the floor is in white leather, the 
walls have padded white leather squares and a shiny 
black ceiling. Each cabin is symmetrical, but with just 
one style and a different colour.  The right guest cabin 
is blue with columns and the left guest cabin is burgundy 
with rectangular geometric decorations; the VIP guest 
cabin on the right has a sea wall with doubloons and the 
VIP guest cabin on the left features curvy walls (and 
sofa). The guest bathrooms have a changing area and a 
bath area, without any real separations, with stone or 
Corian or slate or crema luna floors.  
The upper deck hosts a large living area with black 
leather floor, shiny white lacquered walls and a stem 
wall with mirrors which hide 46 video screens and 
ceiling partly in barrisol (stern) and partly in wovinwall 
– (in the centre), perfect for light effects and creating 
atmosphere.  
Towards the stem there is a day-toilet, with silver leaf 
mosaic and the gym, with a black leather floor. The stern 
wall is covered with a mirror and hides a TV screen, but 
the most interesting thing is the laser indicator which 
projects at request the position of Mecca.
The wheelhouse is black with leather floor and leather 
walls and ceiling. The top is in black carbon. The ship’s 
instrumentation is the most sophisticated possible. The 
area also includes the office and the captain’s cabin. The 
rest of the crew area – a large crew mess, five comfortable 
cabins with bath and the service area – are on the lower 
deck in the stem.
The stern is organized so that when the platform is 
open it becomes a real “terrace on the sea”. Tenders and 
water jets here reside in a side-accessed garage. Particular 
attention has been paid to the comfort of guests thanks 
to stringent standards for soundproofing and noise 
reduction. In the engine room, two Caterpillar 3516B 
engines power M/Y Sea Force One, reaching 17.5 knots 
and achieving around 5,000 nautical miles at economical 
speed. Two Caterpillar generators (200 kW) and an 
emergency 80 kW generator complete the equipment of 
the ship.  
The yacht obtained both the ABS and the RINa 
certifications. M/Y Sea Force One also successfully 
obtained the RINa Green Star, which assures compliance 
with the strictest regulations in terms of environmental 
protection while in no way compromising the freedom 
of navigation and the new RINa Secure Yacht. This new 
certification –Admiral-54 is believed to be the first 
yacht to obtain it – certifies the control and monitoring 
system of all the areas on board, access ways and outside 
areas around the yacht, to assure maximum safety and 
privacy for the guests on board in compliance with the 
anti-trespassing and anti-terrorism regulations, as more 
and more required by certain terminals.

T
he PB Fitzroy is the first of a pair of new RAmparts 
2800 class ship-handling tugs to be built by Cheoy 
Lee Shipyards of Hong Kong. These tugs are another 
example of the successful series of RAmparts class designs 
developed by Robert Allan Ltd of Canada. 
This new vessel was developed to fill a perceived void in 
the designer’s portfolio for this successful series, which 
now totals 80 worldwide. 
Propulsion for PB Fitzroy comprises a pair of Niigata 
6L28 HX diesel engines, each rated 1838kW (2465bhp) 
at 750rpm. The diesel engines drive a Niigata ZP-41A 
Z-Drive with a 2500mm diameter propeller with integral 
slipping clutch and PTO for driving the steering 
hydraulic pump, and a Cardan shafting system. This 
combination allowed the vessel to deliver a bollard pull of 
62tonnes ahead and a free running speed of 13kts when 
on acceptance trials.
The RAmparts 2800 is outfitted for a crew of up to 10 
persons in comfortable quarters. In addition to a spacious 
mess and lounge area at the main deck level there are 
spacious single cabins for the master and chief engineer, 
with a shared en-suite lavatory. On entry into the 
deckhouse through the aft bulkhead, there is a lobby that 
provides access to both the engineroom and the 
accommodations, providing a useful noise barrier. At the 
lower deck there are two four-person cabins for crew. 
The main winch forward, supplied by Unitech Systems 
Pte Ltd is a single drum, hydraulic type, with double 
gypsies and double 300mm diameter warping drums and 
with capacity for 180m of 64mm-diameter synthetic 
hawser. There is also an aft tow bitt fitted with a Mampaey 
65tonne SWL tow-hook.
The tug has a non-rated fire-fighting capability, with 
one main-engine driven pumps rated 1500m³/hour, 
supplying water to a pair of remote-controlled monitors 
forward. There is also a fi-fi foam capability, carried in a 
3000litre, independent stainless steel tank.

L
ung Teh Shipbuilding Co. Ltd delivered six of its 
new 19-meter fast response craft, known as ‘Medium 
Patrol Launches’ in 2007. A further six vessels were 
delivered in April 2008 with the final five expected to 
be delivered in 2009.
The vessel has been designed with good manoeuvring, 
seakeeping and resistance in mind and performs at low 
noise and vibration to operate within Hong Kong 
Special Administration Region (HKSAR) waters in 
weather conditions that can reach Sea State 5. The 
vessel is also designed to provide an effective observation 
platform for crews engaged in continuous visual and 
electronic surveillance duties, without resulting in 
excessive crew fatigue. The high deadrise planing hull 
form of the boat is also verified by model tank testing. 
The hull and deckhouse on the vessel are constructed of 
all-welded marine grade aluminium alloy plates and 
extrusions. The deckhouse plus fittings on it, the mast 
and antenna arrays are designed to avoid damage from 
counter-rolling while alongside a larger vessel.
The scantling of hull structural members is determined 
in accordance with Det Norske Veritas’ (DNV) “Rules 
for Classification of High-Speed, Light Craft and Naval 
Surface Craft” and all the structural drawings are 
approved by DNV. The hull is capable of sustaining 
frequent impacts during boarding operations by Hong 
Kong Police Force (HKPF) officers in rough weather 
within HKSAR waters.
Propulsion onboard the vessel is provided by three 
Caterpillar C32 main engines, three ZF3000 reduction 
gears and three HM461 waterjets to perform the high-
speed and low-speed mission in HKSAR waters.
The vessel is designed with a raked stem, preventing 
metal corrosion at the bow and a transom stern. The 
upper deck side line is reversed S type from amidships 
to bow, to get an excellent sight view when planning. 
An adequate side-deck is arranged extending the full 
length of the deckhouse to facilitate fore and aft 
movement along the shipside. The deckhouse recesses 
any obstructions such as air pipes, vents and so forth.
The air conditioned wheelhouse is designed for five 
HKPF officers and in a configuration arranged to 
provide a forward master for navigation, surveillance 
and police command, and two aft consoles for engine 
monitoring and communication, with all-round 
visibility. All the console arrangements are confined 
ergonomically with more frequently used controls 
grouped within easy reach of the sitting police officer.
The crew mess and pantry, also air conditioned, is 
arranged below deck and aft of forepeak. The crew mess 
is also designed as a crew administration office and for 
the transportation of police officers.
To facilitate the lifting of a casualty or dead body 
from the sea, one portable boom with lifting capacity of 
500kg is installed on the main deck aft.
Following successful sea trials in Taiwan and Hong 
Kong waters, the Medium Patrol Launches (MPL) were 
delivered to Hong Kong Police Force and entered into 
service to execute the sea patrol and replace the ageing 
Mark III launches, which have been in service since the 
early 1980s. The new MPLs’ commissioning will 
provide enhanced police service and increase security 
for Hong Kong waters for many years to come.

A
ustralian fast-ferry designer Austal delivered 64.8m 
passenger catamaran ferry Shinas in June 2008 to 
Muscat for the Government of the Sultanate of Oman. 
Shinas is the first of two diesel-powered passenger 
ferries to be delivered from Austal this year; the second 
vessel Hormuz is still on order and expected to be 
delivered in late 2008.
With a maximum speed of 55.9knots, this vessel is 
believed to be the fastest diesel-powered vehicle-
passenger ferry ever built. The performance has been 
achieved through a new customised high-efficiency hull 
design that was created, capable of delivering high 
performance, as well as by successfully meeting 
demanding weight targets during construction. All 
onboard systems and structures were accessed with 
regards to weight optimisation.
During the design process, three iterations of the hull 
form were tank tested, including in-house 
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis 
between iterations. The vessels’ wind resistance was also 
assessed using 3D CFD modelling to reduce wind drag 
and wind noise. Fittings on the external decks were 
optimised to further reduce drag and wind noise.
In order to adapt to the high temperatures in the 
Omani region, special consideration has been made to 
achieve low ambient air temperatures in the engineroom 
to ensure the engines would not de-rate, whilst ensuring 
airborne material is kept out through the incorporation 
of dust filters. Specially rated air-conditioning, as well as 
a dehumidifier to remove moisture from incoming air, 
were installed to maintain passenger comfort. Special 
attention was paid to rubber seals and other material to 
ensure they survive ambient conditions of 50°C +.
A unique addition to the design of a non-military 
vessel is the large helicopter deck located behind the 
wheelhouse, utilised for the transfer of VIP passengers 
and emergency situations. The helicopter deck includes 
lighting and glide scope indicator for operations at 
night.
The high-speed ferry can accommodate 208 
passengers and 56 cars along an intended 180nm coastal 
route. The vessel offers unparalleled comfort across 
three classes – Tourist Class, First Class and VIP. High 
quality seating and catering facilities are all located on a 
single deck, with seakeeping comfort enhanced by the 
Austal Ride Control System.
Shinas is powered by four MTU 20-cylinder 
1163-series diesel engines, each producing 6,500kW 
and driving Rolls-Royce/Kamewa waterjets. The vessel 
is built in accordance with the requirements and under 
the survey of Det Norske Veritas, conforming to the 
IMO High Speed Craft code (HSC 2000).

S
olway Spirit is the sixth of a new series of South 
Catamaran 47/15m alloy wind farm service vessel. 
This new design follows on from existing vessels in class 
and features its ‘Crew Bus’ superstructure design.
The vessel’s propulsion is provided by twin Scania 
DI12 60M 600hp diesel engines driving ZF360 1.237:1 
reduction ratio gearboxes coupled to Ultra Dynamics 
451 waterjet units. This package offers the vessel a 
maximum speed of 24kt and a 21kts fast cruising speed 
at 2000rpm (combined 196litres/hour). At low cruising 
speeds (18kts at 1800rpm) the vessel offers a frugal fuel 
consumption of 144 litres per hour.
Deck equipment includes a raised Palfinger PK4500M 
fully folding knuckle boom crane and a Hercules 1tonne 
hydraulic capstan. A common hydraulic system allows 
the ships crane to lift out the vessels machinery when 
required to minimise down time on the vessel. The bow 
of the vessel is dominated by the MkV WTG (wind 
turbine generator) access platform and fender system. 
The South Boats Wind Farm Vessels continue to be the 
only service vessels specifically designed for docking to 
offshore wind farms and the transfer system, which is 
well proven, has become an industry requirement for 
which South Boats holds a registered design.
When loaded with 5tonnes of calibrated ballast the 
vessel maintained a 20kt sprint speed. Wheelhouse and 
saloon noise is less than 64dB at full speed. The static 
thrust is impressive with this engine/jet package and the 
vessel has greatly improved static thrust when pushing 
against wind farm towers and whilst powering through 
rough weather. A Humphree Interceptor and ride 
control system has been fitted to the vessel to aid trim 
and performance whilst carrying high payloads and to 
maximise performance in heavy weather.
Ultra Dynamics Jetmaster control system is fitted to 
the vessel, providing impressive manoeuvring power for 
the vessel. Multi axis joystick and back up control levers 
are fitted at the main helm position. A digital screen 
display enables set-up and diagnostics, as well as letting 
the helmsman see at a glance the actual position of the 
UltraJet deflectors. The specially developed digital PLC 
network converts the joystick commands to boat 
movements harnessing the full benefits of watertight 
propulsion. This UltraJet control system offers features 
previously only available on more expensive systems.
The crew saloon is accessed from the aft deck through 
a Seaglaze series 21 part glazed aluminium door and is 
fitted as a ‘crew bus’ with 6 x KAB214 complete with 
arm rests and lap belts. The vessel also has the unique 
ability to be transformed into a wind farm VIP/mobile 
office vessel within hours with two large tables replacing 
some seats and providing a 4 by 4 format with computer 
and office table between. Forward in the saloon is the 
galley.
The wheelhouse is fitted with a KAB514 helm slightly 
offset from the centre line with all controls directed 
towards the helmsman and a second KAB514 crew seat 
is fitted to port in the wheelhouse. The vessel is 
equipped with an electronics package, supplied and pre-
integrated by Ambex Ltd of Brighton, comprising 
Furuno radar, Furuno Navnet chart plotter, Furuno 
Navnet video sounder, PC-based Olex plotting and 
mapping system with a Hemisphere GPS Gyro, Furuno 
AIS, Furuno Navtex, Twin Furuno GPS sets, Class A 
Furuno VHF, Class D Furuno VHF, Furuno Loud 
Hailer and a Furuno Autopilot.
The ergonomic helm position has full visibility of the 
boarding area and allows for observation of pilots 
ascending and descending ships ladders though large 
tinted ‘pilot style’ observation windows in the 
wheelhouse roof. The fully cocooned, heated, thermal 
and noise insulated wheelhouse and saloon are finished 
with synthetic carpet lining above the window line, 
insulated composite panels below the window line and 
anodized aluminium trim sections. The accommodation 
void is accessed from the saloon and features a single 
berth in a fully lined and insulated compartment 
beneath the wheelhouse raised from the floor with 
stowage areas beneath and aft.
The fuel tank spaces are forward of the engine rooms 
and each is fitted with a 1275litre aluminium fuel 
tank. 
Solway Spirit has been inspected by the MCA and is 
certified to operate under MCA Category 2 Waters 
(60nm) for 12 passengers, 3 crew and 5,000kg’s of deck 
cargo.
Solway Spirit will operate at the Robin Rigg offshore 
wind farm in the Solway Firth for energy company E.
ON Climate and Renewables UK Ltd from the Port of 
Workington.

reire Construcciones Navales of Vigo, Spain has 
delivered the first in series of a fleet of new escort 
tugs being built under 20-year contracts with the 
operators of the following LNG terminals: Dragon 
LNG (a consortium of BG, Petronas of Malaysia and 
Dutch energy company, 4Gas) and South Hook LNG 
(Qatar Petroleum LNG, Elf Petroleum and Exxon 
Mobil). 
Svitzer Waterston has an impressive bollard pull of 
92tonnes and was built to a new design, RAstar 3400 
class, specifically developed by Canadian naval 
architects, Robert Allan Ltd, for LNG terminal escort 
duties. The vessel is the first of six Robert Allan designed 
RAstar terminal tugs to be completed by Freire. The 
other vessels will be completed at regular intervals. 
Regretfully the vessel suffered an accident, which has 
delayed her entering service at Milford Haven Port 
Authority. It is understood that the 7,880bhp vessel had 
performed exceptionally well during acceptance trials 
and had exceeded the 92tonnes bollard pull requirement 
by a healthy margin.
Svitzer Waterston has been included in Significant 
Small Ships of 2008 due to her innovative design and 
impressive bollard pull.

T
aha Dua and Taha Satu are the first two of a series 
of four ‘Sea Axe’ Fast Crew Supplier 3307 (FCS 
3307) vessels delivered by Damen Shipyards for the 
Malaysian offshore operator Powertium Engineering 
Sdn Bhd.
Like the other Damen-built vessels in Significant 
Small Ships of 2008, Caspian Breeze, and Don Osiris, the 
sister vessels Taha Dua and Taha Satu were built to the 
‘Sea Axe’ hullform design. This hull-form is based on 
the Axe Bow Concept, which is based on an extreme 
deep and high flair-less bow. The bow gives the boat 
unparalleled ‘soft’ vertical accelerations, according to 
Damen.
As Fast Crew Suppliers these vessels will be providing 
crew and cargo transfer from shore to platform as well 
as ‘inter-platform’ service. The Sea Axe design, together 
with luxurious passenger space creates a comfortable 
environment for crew transfers.
The 33.45m loa FCS 3307 is the first ship-type for 
which Damen chose to apply the ‘Sea Axe’ hull-form. 
Taha Dua and Taha Satu are basically crew boats, which 
also can be used as Fast Suppliers, but with limited 
capacity. The ships are built entirely from aluminium by 
Damen Shipyards Singapore.

T
he design of the fast rescue workboat (FRWB) 
Wave Ranger has been a joint development between 
Alnmaritec, an aluminium workboat builder and 
designer and Camarc, who design rigid inflatable boats 
(RIB) and fast rescue craft.
This new design marked the launch of a new concept 
in fast rescue boats. The boat is designed to meet the 
stringent requirements of the Safety of Life at Sea 
(SOLAS) code and she is certified as a ‘SOLAS fast 
rescue boat’, yet she is also functionally designed to suit 
the requirements of an offshore workboat and is 
classified as such under the UK Maritime and 
Coastguard Agency (MCA) workboat code. 
Wave Ranger is an aluminium RIB-style craft based on 
the successful Camarc double chine hull form and she is 
both rugged and versatile with design features from 
both the range of Alnmaritec offshore workboats and 
the Camarc range of fast rescue craft.
Wave Ranger is fitted with a single Yanmar inboard 
driving diesel driving a Hamilton waterjet (there are 
other propulsion options available) and she has a small 
protected wheelhouse with two aft windows and a 
forward windscreen. A short mast carrying lights and 
aerials is mounted on the shelter roof together with a 
searchlight and the self righting bag. A helm and a crew 
seat are positioned at the console with two passenger 
seats immediately behind as well as external seating for 
a further six passengers. For her rescue duties the vessel 
is fitted with a single point lift and an offload release 
mechanism, she has a self righting bag and a two pack 
internal foam buoyancy system. 
Wave Ranger has a quick release painter system and 
the boat has rescue capacity for up to 15 survivors and a 
stretcher. For her working role the boat has a 1tonne 
capstan and line handling gear aft and a bow access 
platform forward. 
The design incorporates a development of the new 
‘Pop Sure’ fendering system, which has proven to be 
successful on pilot boats with a standard rubber coated 
foam moulding providing the solid collar, but with a 
PTFE rubbing pipe to take the wear and tear out of 
workboat operations. The vessel is designed to allow 
ready access for maintenance of all machinery.
Wave Ranger is robustly-built to cope with the rigours 
of both rescue and workboat operations and her 
powerful engine and waterjet give excellent bollard pull 
and manoeuvrability. She is seaworthy, fast and stable 
and will provide a significant step change in functional 
performance over the traditional SOLAS fast rescue 
boats.
