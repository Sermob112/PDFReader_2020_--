elivered in late 2015, thus narrowly missing the 
deadline for last year’s Significant Small Ships 
collection, the 14.95m aluminium wave-piercing vessel 
AHTO-14 represented the debut model in Baltic 
Workboats’ Pilot 1500 WP class – a design that Baltic 
Workboats has developed to offer users “top-of-the-
segment seakeeping capability”. 
At the request of the owner (Estonian Pilot Ltd), 
AHTO-14 was designed with additional rescue 
capability, in the form of a hydraulic rescue platform 
situated in the vessel’s aft. To get the most out of this 
feature, the designer/builder focused on making the 
craft’s draught as shallow as possible, and succeeded in 
restricting this element to below 0.85m. 
In terms of safety, Baltic Workboats also paid special 
attention to AHTO-14's wheelhouse windshield, which 
was designed specifically for maximum crew visibility, 
with the aim of avoiding collisions and related accidents. 
AHTO-14 accommodates a two-man crew and 
provides room for six pilots to sit in comfort. The vessel’s 
noise levels have been kept to a minimum, with Baltic 
Workboats managing to limit noise recorded in the 
wheelhouse to the 65dB mark at full speed. 
As another concession to crew/pilot comfort, the 
vessel’s wave-piercing hull design enables softer, 
smoother rides at higher sea states, thereby eliminating 
the need to spend money on an extra pilot boat designed 
specifically for operations in foul weather. The double 
chine is also effective in minimising the amount of green 
water and water spray that ends up on deck. 
Twin Volvo Penta D13MH marine diesel engines 
provide the vessel’s power, with ZF 325-1 marine 
transmissions propelling her to a maximum speed of 
27knots, via a pair of fixed-pitch propellers.

A
s the first of two sister vessels designed and 
built for the Royal Navy of Oman (RNO), 
Austal’s 72.5m loa high-speed support vessel 
(HSSV) Al Mubshir could be described as a more 
compact and lightweight take on an established 
warship design. 
The vessel was developed specifically for the RNO 
based on the 103m expeditionary fast transport 
(EPF) platform that Austal developed for the US 
Navy in 2008. The all-aluminium  Al Mubshir, which 
was handed over to the RNO from Austal’s 
Henderson yard in Australia in May 2016 (her sister 
vessel,  Al Naasir, followed in September), can 
accommodate up to 260 troops and offers medium 
lift aviation support, courtesy of a helicopter deck. 
Intended for a whole host of military, search and 
rescue and relief mission tasks in both open-sea and 
littoral environments,  Al Mubshir can achieve a top 
speed of 40knots and a range of up to 2,740nm at 
12.5knots, and features a shallow draught of less than 
3m, maximising the craft’s options when it comes to 
accessing coastal and shallow-water areas. 
The design includes a 900m² vehicle deck, a 
pivoting roll-on/roll-off stern ramp and cranes, to 
facilitate quick and efficient payload transfers in any 
port, Austal says. The vessel also carries a pair of 7.3m 
RIBs, which can be deployed in specific missions. 
Austal comments: “Unlike traditional, steel 
monohull naval vessels, the HSSV can transport 
more troops, vehicles and equipment more easily and 
much more quickly to remote locations, with no or 
little port infrastructure required.” As such, the 
builder and designer envisages this type of vessel as 
potentially providing a less expensive alternative to 
the use of traditional military transporter aircraft, 
such as the C130 Hercules. 
Alternatively, Austal suggests, the HSSV platform 
could be further modified, to create, for instance, a 
high-speed hospital ship; one could adapt the 
vessel’s space to accommodate operating theatres, 
medical rooms and rehab facilities. Overall,  Al 
Mubshir reflects the growing tendency for naval 
forces to seek out alternatives to slower and heavier 
logistics and support vessels – and points towards a 
future of more compact, cost-effective and flexible 
fleet solutions.

N
otably, the Damen-designed, 42.4m ferry Albert 
Nile-1 has been entirely configured from 
container-sized floating units. 
These units, which are referred to as Damen 
Modular Barges, can be likened to ‘building blocks’ 
and used to construct vessels and/or pontoons. They 
are transportable to remote areas, inland waterways 
and coastal spots, and represent a potential solution for 
parties requiring vessels at land-locked water areas, for 
example, permitting assembly to be conducted on site. 
Each Damen Modular Barge consists of a 20’ (6.1m) or 
40’ (12.2m) container-sized module. 
Options for these blocks range from wheelhouses 
and accommodation units to moon pools, bulwarks 
and bollards. “Machinery, superstructure and deck 
equipment are mounted to modular units to the hull 
construction,” Damen says. 
The Damen Modular Barges can be coupled together 
in the water with a specially designed coupling system, 
monikered the Damen Link. 
Following construction, Albert Nile-1  was 
disassembled and transported to Uganda via 22 
trucks, and assembled on site at Lake Albert. The 
vessel incorporates four Perkins engines, delivering 
a combined output of 447.4kW, driving four 
propellers through PRM Marine gearboxes. The 
vessel has been developed with seating for 200 
passengers, though Damen confirms that 
provisions were made to accommodate 300 
persons in total.

T
he first US-built and -flagged offshore wind 
farm support vessel officially left the blocks in 
April, in the form of the 21.4m Atlantic Pioneer. 
Built to the tune of more than US$4 million by 
Rhode Island’s Blount Boats, the vessel has been 
delivered to operator Atlantic Wind Transfers, a 
subsidiary of Rhode Island Fast Ferry which was 
specifically set up in 2015 to provide offshore wind 
farm services. Atlantic Pioneer has subsequently 
been tasked with servicing the 30MW Block Island 
turbine farm, a development located some 4.8km 
offshore the north-east US state. 
As the US marine sector is subject to the terms 
of the protectionist Jones Act, any vessel operating 
in North American waters must have been 
constructed in the US. As Blount Boats’ first 
attempt to construct a vessel of this type, input 
from the UK proved invaluable to Atlantic 
Pioneer's development. The vessel’s design was 
provided by South Boats Isle of Wight (IOW), 
which has provided the plans for more than 80 
existing and operational wind farm support 
vessels in the UK and Europe. Atlantic Pioneer 
has been built to South Boats IOW’s DNV 
GL-certified 21m aluminium catamaran design, 
and can carry up to 49 passengers – or up to 16 
turbine technicians – as well as three members of 
crew and 12tonnes of equipment and parts. 
Additionally, Atlantic Pioneer is the first 
US-built aluminium craft to comply with the 
USCG’s Subchapter L requirements (for offshore 
vessels). The craft has also been developed to 
comply with the USCG’s Subchapter T 
requirements for small passenger vessels under 
30.5m in length. In this way, when the vessel is 
not being utilised for offshore wind farm support 
activities, it can be hired out as a sightseeing 
vessel and undertake cruises for guests. 
The transfer vessel is powered by two MAN V12 
engines, rated 1,044kW apiece, feeding Hamilton 
Jet HM571 waterjets through ZF Marine 3050 
gears. This set-up enables the vessel to operate at 
a cruising speed of 26knots, or at more than 
30knots in sprint mode. In terms of range, 
Atlantic Pioneer can reportedly operate “for 
several days at a time between refuelling”, owner 
and operator Atlantic Wind Transfers says, 
courtesy of an onboard fuel capacity of 
approximately 7,950litres.
Personnel transit from the vessel to the turbine 
via a boarding platform situated on Atlantic 
Pioneer’s bow, which is fitted with a special 
fendering system that connects to the turbine 
base and enables safe transfers in significant wave 
heights of 1.5m.

M
easuring 44m x 11.4m, and designed in 
close cooperation between Kystverket, 
Hvide Sande Shipyard, Steel & Service and Jorgen 
Petersen Ltd (now part of OSK-ShipTech), the 
multi-purpose vessel Bøkfjord has been described 
as constituting “two vessels in one hull”. 
On one hand, the vessel functions as a 
maintenance ship for buoys and beacons; on the 
other, Bøkfjord has been developed to act as a 
fast-response oil recovery vessel, having been 
equipped with surface oil skimmers and 
dedicated holding tanks for recovered oil, in 
addition to the offshore working cranes that one 
might expect from a more typical maintenance 
vessel. Not only that, but Bøkfjord has also been 
developed with environmental compliance in 
mind, featuring an advanced diesel-electric 
hybrid propulsion system. 
The vessel’s accommodation has been designed 
with exterior cleaning facilities and dedicated 
secondary access in oil recovery operation mode. 
On top, the navigation bridge is integrated with 
operation control facilities for full 360degs 
visibility. The operation facilities area functions 
on a daily basis as the planning centre for the 
maintenance of buoys and beacons. When tasked 
with oil recovery operations, however, this 
onboard area functions as a base for the oil 
response team.
The vessel is equipped with a complex ramp 
system, allowing the vessel to approach and call 
at smaller islands. The ramps can also be used 
for dynamic positioning (DP) purposes – for 
instance, when the vessel is undergoing repairs 
at sea. 
The activation of DP during repairs was a major 
reason for the selection of a hybrid propulsion 
system, OSK-ShipTech explains. The group 
comments: “In DP mode, only one generator is 
running at optimal load, whilst simultaneously 
charging batteries. In harbour in general, 
operation is conducted on batteries to eliminate 
noise pollution.”

B
illed as being the largest RIB to enter its fleet to 
date, Commercial Rib Charter’s (CRC’s) 15m 
cabin craft CRC Galaxy has been developed to 
fulfil a wide range of marine missions, including 
crew transfer – particularly involving offshore 
wind turbine farms – and survey/dive work. 
As a result of CRC Galaxy’s MCA Category 1 
coding and the fact that she has been fitted with 
lifting hooks, supplied by Norwegian manufacturer 
Henriksen Hooks, the vessel can also be utilised as 
a daughter craft aboard a larger vessel, thus 
widening her window of launch and mission 
opportunities. The coding also enables the RIB to 
operate independently at distances of up to 150nm 
from the nearest safe haven when carrying six 
people, and up to 60nm when carrying a full 
complement of three crew members and 12 
passengers (such as technicians, divers or 
scientists). 
A total of 14 air suspension seats, manufactured 
by Grammer, provide protection against slamming 
and the risk of whole body vibration. These seats, 
however, are removable, enabling CRC (and its 
clients) to rearrange the craft’s layout as required; 
for instance, swapping some (or all) of the seats to 
accommodate work stations, work benches and 
instrumentation, in order to conduct survey work. 
The cabin can also be modified to accommodate 
additional bunks, if so required, and features a 
galley and shower facilities. 
Two Volvo Penta engines drive a pair of 
HamiltonJet HJ322 waterjets. The latter are fitted 
with HamiltonJet’s blueARROW control system, 
for optimal manoeuvrability at low speeds, and, 
alongside her 0.8m draught, these enable the RIB 
to access waters which may be typically inaccessible 
by traditional CTVs. As such, CRC has welcomed 
the vessel’s ability to guarantee “transfers to inshore 
assets at almost all states of tide.” Personnel 
transfers are conducted over the RIB’s bow, 
courtesy of a bow snubber. 
Compared to standard industry CTVs, RIBS also 
offer a rather lucrative advantage in terms of cost 
savings. Speaking earlier in 2016, following CRC 
Galaxy’s launch, CRC director Stuart Hedges 
commented: “RIBs attract much lower running 
costs, burning 120litres of fuel an hour compared 
to bigger boats using four times as much.” 
And, although CRC Galaxy remains a sole vessel 
for now, CRC has hinted that a second 15m cabin 
RIB – or an even longer version – could well be on 
the cards; given the versatility offered by this 
delivery, it’s not difficult to see why.

L
ast year, Stockholm University, Sweden 
enhanced its offerings to students and guest 
scientists by taking delivery of a new scientific 
research vessel, Electra. Assembled by Estonian 
builder Baltic Workboats, Electra has been 
developed to carry up to 35 passengers, in 
addition to crew, and her main tasks are to 
undertake research work on the Baltic Sea and to 
ferry students between the mainland campus and 
the university’s research lab on Askö Island, 
situated in the Trosa archipelago, approximately 
80km south of Stockholm. This latter hub, 
surrounded by hundreds of islands, serves as a 
valuable maritime research centre for students 
and visiting scientists alike. 
Featuring a steel hull, Electra measures 24.3m x 
7.2m, has been designed to draw 2.1m, and 
features a combined 42m² of laboratory and work 
space. The craft is kitted out with a wide array of 
research equipment, including: Kongsberg’s 
Topas PS40 parametric sub-bottom profiler, and 
sensors; Simrad’s EK80 echo sounder and 
EM2040 multibeam echo sounder; Valeport’s 
Mini SVS sound velocity sensor and Mini SVP 
sound velocity profiler; and acoustic Doppler 
current profiler (ADCP) sensors. These are all 
connected by a K-sync system. 
The vessel’s complement is thus effectively able 
to monitor and collate information related to the 
seabed and surrounding waters. Using this set-up, 
participants can probe up to 50m within the 
seabed’s sediment layers. A KVM system enables 
all data gathered by these sensors to be displayed 
on up to 17 onboard monitors. 
To facilitate sampling, Electra is equipped with 
four dedicated research winches, including a 12m 
pistol corer for the collection of bottom sediment 
samples. This arrangement is supported by three 
cranes and an A-frame. 
A customised electrical winch, rated 
approximately 7.5kW, is situated in the vessel’s 
wet lab area. This winch has been integrated with 
a Kongsberg motion reference unit (MRU), so as 
to compensate winch wire length depending on 
vessel movement. 
Crew are housed in four below-deck cabins – two 
double, two single – and, with their comfort in mind, 
Baltic Workboats says that it has created an insulated 
environment in which volume levels have been 
reduced to 55dBA max, both in this accommodation 
area and within the vessel’s work zones. 
Similarly, stability was an important 
consideration in this vessel’s development. To this 
end, Baltic Workboats has fitted the boat with two 
Seakeeper 35HD gyrostabilisers, to provide a 
steady platform for scientists working inside the 
onboard lab space. Also, to curtail vessel 
movement due to wind and/or current, Electra 
has been fitted with a DP system, supplied by 
Navis Engineering.

mbla represents the debutante in Icelandic 
boatyard Rafnar’s Leiftur 1100 Cabin Explorer 
RIB class, developed to achieve and maintain 
high operational speeds in the roughest of 
environments. Indeed, the 11.1m RIB’s 1,307nm 
maiden voyage from Iceland to Gothenburg, 
Sweden, which took place in May 2016, saw her 
take all the North Atlantic had to throw at her in 
terms of wind, rain and even an outboard-
wrecking log. However, a minor repair aside, 
Embla and her six-man complement made it to 
Sweden unscathed, justifying the Leiftur 1100 
Cabin Explorer RIB’s reputation as the 
‘workhorse’ of the Rafnar range. 
Embla’s backbone is the ÖK Hull, which was 
designed and perfected in-house by Rafnar and 
debuted in 2015. Compared to similarly sized 
planing or semi-planing hulls, the ÖK Hull has 
been developed to provide unusually high levels of 
stability and comfort at high speeds (especially 
when travelling at 40knots or more) – 
considerations that are becoming increasingly 
scrutinised as naval, police and military customers 
look to combat fatigue and the likelihood of whole 
body vibration-related injuries. 
Also, while being displacement-type hulls and 
remaining, for the most part, in the water, the ÖK 
Hull concept enables the vessel to power forward 
without creating a displaced-water ‘bow-wave’, 
and simultaneously avoiding the formation of a 
‘hole’ in the transom area behind the boat. 
Therefore, when powering forward at speed, or 
decreasing speed rapidly, the boat constantly 
retains an ‘even-keel’ aspect, not fighting to 
overcome the water ahead and attempting to 
‘climb over the hump’, and likewise not falling 
back into the ‘hole’ when decelerating suddenly.  
Although Embla is fitted with 184kW Evinrude 
outboards, developments have seen Rafnar 
approach Lloyd’s Register for build certification 
for motors such as Mercury’s 298kW Verado 
range, which could take the RIB type’s speed up to 
more than 50knots. The vessel can be picked up 
and stowed aboard any mothership with room for 
a RIB of between 4-6tonnes, and, aside from her 
obvious advantages as a military/SAR craft, the 
boat could equally be used as an effective, safe 
and stable tender for superyacht and megayacht 
guests; if her cross-North Atlantic escapades 
couldn’t daunt her, recreational life in the 
Mediterranean certainly won’t.

volution, which was designed and built for 
Down Under Cruise & Dive of Cairns, 
Australia, and delivered in February 2016, is 
intended to represent a cross between a motor 
yacht – specifically in terms of style and comfort 
– and a more rugged, utilitarian aluminium 
commercial vessel, in order to provide a workable, 
yet attractive, means of escorting passengers to 
and from the Great Barrier Reef. 
As a result, the vessel features large and 
well-glazed interior spaces, while outdoor 
spaces are equipped with comfortable lounges 
and protection from the sun. Passengers are 
able to board the vessel via gates situated aft 
and amidships on the main deck, as well as 
through an additional set of gates located on 
the upper deck. 
The vessel also incorporates three platforms, for 
use when the vessel is at rest at the Reef. These 
include a lifting stern platform, and two aft fold-
down platforms, located port and starboard. 
When positioned, these three platforms encircle 
the aft end of the vessel, thereby granting her 
diver complement comfortable and safe access to 
the water.
The main cabin has seats for 151 persons, and 
also contains a bar and a kiosk. Aft of this are 
toilets and access to the aft deck, which also 
features storage spaces for wetsuits, snorkels and 
dive tanks. 
A set of stairs on the aft main deck leads to the 
upper deck, with outdoor seating and a lifeguard 
lookout station. Inside the upper deck cabin there 
is booth seating for 46 passengers, as well as a VIP 
room designed to accommodate 10 persons. 
Forward of the wheelhouse are sun lounges and a 
stairway to the foredeck. 
The roof deck features forward-facing seats and 
lounges to the aft. This deck, which is covered by 
a solid roof, can accommodate 70 passengers. 
Evolution has been designed to operate at a 
cruising speed of 25knots at 90% MCR, courtesy 
of two MAN D2862 LE463 engines, rated 
1,029kW apiece.

osna Triton made an immediate impression 
in 2016 as the first tailor-made ocean 
farming vessel to be delivered by Norway’s 
Maritime Partner. 
Developed jointly by Maritime Partner and 
ocean farming service supplier Abyss Group, the 
latter of which oversees ocean farming vessel 
operator Abyss Aqua, the vessel was built to the 
specs of the Alusafe 1500 Light Diving Vessel 
(LDV) class, featuring an overall length of 15.8m 
and a moulded beam of 4.6m.
Despite her small size, though, Fosna Triton 
has been specifically developed to handle 
rough seas, harsh conditions and abundant 
workloads. The Norwegian Maritime 
Directorate has subsequently classified the 
craft as suitable for deployment in coastal 
operations, thereby enabling Fosna Triton to 
perform operations in open waters and all 
along the Norwegian coastline. 
The contract was also hailed as an example of 
“combined competence” within the Norwegian 
marine cluster, at a time when the ocean farming 
sector (and, in particular, the deep-sea ocean 
farming segment) is looking to incorporate 
technologies and practices developed for 
offshore interests.  Speaking at the time of Fosna 
Triton’s delivery, Olav Otterlei, technical 
manager at Abyss Group, commented: “We can 
clearly see that there are great benefits to relying 
on each other’s mutual experiences from the 
combined industries of offshore…and ocean 
farming, both with regards to competence, 
equipment and vessels.” 
The vessel will primarily be used to enable dive 
inspections of both “hulls and the nets of future 
ocean farms,” Abyss Aqua has stated, although 
she can also be utilised for fish delousing 
operations. The vessel’s deck is fitted with a single 
Palfinger PC2700N crane, featuring a safe 
working load (SWL) of 2.7tonnes, and a sole stern 
winch manufactured by MB Hydraulikk AS. 
A pair of Scania DI13 engines, rated 522kW 
apiece and driving twin Hamilton HJ364 
waterjets, enable a cruising speed of 30knots, 
increasing to 35knots max.

ailed as comprising Dutch builder Heesen 
Yachts’ largest delivery to date, the 70m 
loa fast displacement hull form (FDHF) 
superyacht Galactica Super Nova is reported 
to be one of the top 200 largest yachts in the 
world – and certainly the largest yacht to have 
emerged from the group’s yard. 
Built for an anonymous owner, the 
aluminium, motor-powered vessel boasts a 
number of high-end features to please even 
the most demanding of guests, including: 
357m² of deck space and the ability to deploy 
the foredeck as a helipad; an outdoor cinema 
area;  and an informal dining space-cum-
sunbathing plot. 
Additional luxuries include a 6m swim-jet 
infinity pool (complete with waterfall, glass-
panelled bottom and spa jets), a 146m² ‘beach 
club’ area and a shaded sundeck. 
The upper deck has also been designed to 
combine with the sky lounge, creating a 
sizeable indoor/outdoor entertainment area 
covering 92m². Naval architect Espen Øino 
designed Galactica Super Nova’s exterior lines, 
while Sinot Exclusive Yacht Design was 
responsible for her interiors. 
Just as important as her onboard opulence, 
however, is the vessel’s FDHF technology, 
which was developed by van Oossanen Naval 
Architects, also of the Netherlands. 
The FDHF concept dates back to 1992, when 
(current) managing director Perry van 
Oossanen tasked himself with developing a 
new hull design capable of boosting efficiency 
and reducing hydrodynamic resistance across 
a wider speed spectrum. This move was partly 
born out of dissatisfaction with the 
performance of round bilge displacement 
hulls. Such hull forms are efficient when the 
owner is travelling at low speeds; however, 
attempts to increase speed are significantly 
restricted by the amounts of wave resistance 
generated by bilge displacement hulls. 
Switching to a hard chine hull, meanwhile, 
would have enabled higher speeds, but would 
have also resulted in increased draught and 
drag when travelling at low speed. 
As a result, van Oossanen opted for a 
bulbous bow design, combined with a slender 
fore body and a shallow transom area, the 
latter only minimally submerged. A vertical 
metal plate, or ‘interceptor’, was added to the 
transom below the waterline, to ‘intercept’ 
water flowing under the hull to provide 
significant lift at the back of the boat, 
improving its overall horizontal trim. This lift, 
in combination with the shallow transom area, 
also enables the installation of larger 
propellers – a scenario from which Galactica 
Super Nova has benefited. In sea trials, the 
FDHF concept has been proven to reduce 
wave resistance by 20%.

duties include assisting the berthing, loading and 
unberthing of offtake tankers of up to 46,287dwt and 
escorting the above FPSO in the event of 
disconnection from the submerged buoy mooring 
for hurricane avoidance purposes, and the vessel is 
equipped to tow the FPSO in case of mechanical 
breakdown. Other tasks include transportation of 
stores and cargo to the FPSO. A hybrid propulsion 
system allows for economic propulsion (eco-transit 
of 8–9 knots) and station-keeping on one engine, 
driving mechanically/electrically to propulsion units 
and or bow thrusters. The hybrid system has a dual 
output (PTO/PTI)/single input gearbox driving the 
propulsion shaft line on one side and the motor/
generator on the other. 
The ship is set up to run in the following modes:
•	 Conventional/Transit

D
esigned to the specs of Rolls-Royce’s NV 370 class, 
the development of the stern trawler Holmøy was 
strongly influenced by the results of sea trials 
conducted aboard Prestfjord Havfiske’s 2010-built 
fishing vessel Prestfjord (also a Rolls-Royce design). 
Using sensors to capture data from approximately 
30,000 hours of operation aboard Prestfjord, Rolls-
Royce analysed this cache of info in order to optimise 
Holmøy’s hull, equipment and propulsion 
arrangements, in both transit and trawling modes. 
On its March 2016 launch, Holmøy also represented 
the first commercial order of the designer’s new 
medium-speed Bergen B33:45 engine. The B33:45 
engine reportedly offers a 20% increase in power for 
each cylinder compared to other Bergen models. 
Rolls-Royce adds: “The engines are economical with 
a specific fuel consumption of 177g/kWh at full load 
and comply with IMO Tier II and Tier III rules.” The 
engine is also designed to run for 25,000 hours 
between major maintenance periods, and provides all 
of the power required for the vessel’s trawling and fish 
freezing activities, as well as the vessel’s overall  
hotel load. 
Holmøy has also been equipped with the first 
commercial trawl winches to be powered by 
permanent magnet (PM) motors. Developed, again, by 
Rolls-Royce, the PM-powered winches result in far less 
noise and vibration, while enabling sensitive control 
and rapid changes in pull and speed. 
Other equipment supplied by Rolls-Royce includes 
eight sweepline winches, each rated 20tonnes; eight 
auxiliary winches; and a net drum with a capacity of 20m.

A
s the first Damen-designed and built ASD 
Tug 3212, Luisa Neri arrived at her home 
port of Livorno (Leghorn), Italy at the beginning 
of 2016, just five months after owner/operator 
Fratelli Neri signed the contract for her 
construction. Having been built for stock 
simplified this process, freeing up Damen 
Maaskant Shipyards Stellendam to concentrate 
on the final outfitting works. The Port of 
Livorno is acknowledged as being a challenging 
harbour in which to operate, due to a series of 
tight turns that require optimal vessel 
manouevrabilty to negotiate. 
One of Luisa Neri’s key significant features is a 
render-recovery towing winch, also designed by 
Damen, which is intended to lead to improved 
safety and flexibility when the vessel is partaking in 
towing and escorting operations – and which 
enables the tug’s operators to work in a variety of 
tough offshore environments. 
The render-recovery winch works by preventing 
the high peak loads that can occur in the towing 
wire in rough conditions, Damen explains. This is 
accomplished by rendering speeds of up to 100m/
min with a line force of 100tonnes and recovery 
speeds up to 50m/min with a line force of 60tonnes. 
According to Erik van Schaik, Damen senior 
design and proposal engineer: “The render-recovery 
winch gives tug captains an outstanding degree of 
flexibility; they can work with various operating 
modes depending on the weather, the sea conditions 
and the work needed to be done. These modes are 
used to control either the distance or the forces 
acting between tug and the vessel it is assisting.” 
The aft towing winch, meanwhile, is a single 
drum towing winch, with 750m of steel towing 
wire on the drum. Because the winches are not 
provided with gearboxes, the design has been kept 
relatively compact and maintenance-friendly. 
Other features include a high degree of dynamic 
stability, conferred by Luisa Neri’s deep skeg, bilge 
keels and relatively low wheelhouse, which ensure 
low accelerations for increased comfort, safety and 
seakeeping performance. The vessel is also 
equipped with a fendering system with a large 
contact area, for low static contact pressure, while 
a combination of a large freeboard, more 
pronounced V-shaped frames in the lines of the 
fore ship and a raised forecastle deck help to keep 
the working deck dry.

A
s the debutante in architect Albatross Marine 
Design’s (AMD’s) ASV1500W catamaran 
class, the Multipurpose Transport Vessel (MTV) 
55, which Thailand’s Bakri Cono Shipyard 
delivered in October 2016, represents an attempt 
to balance small craft functionality, safety and 
utilitarian ‘water bus’-style design with luxury 
interiors and high-speed performance. 
The MTV55’s arrangement is fairly simple, 
incorporating an air-con-enhanced passenger 
saloon area with forward-looking seats. These 
seats can accommodate between 40 and 54 
passengers, and are positioned either side of a 
central passageway. AMD reveals that design 
inspiration was gleaned from the “ergonomics 
and dimensioning of business and economy class 
aircraft sections”, albeit with a greater degree of 
space between the seat rows.  In comparison to 
monohull craft, the designer says: “For craft with 
the same passenger capacity, catamarans offer 
about 40% more saloon area per passenger, which 
results in more comfortable accommodation.”
The steering station is located starboard, at the 
front part of the saloon, and features a console 
and seats for two crew members. The starboard 
area also houses a service room with pantry, 
while the toilet is located at the stern part of the 
saloon, port side. The aft section is an open deck, 
which passengers can use to board via the side 
doors, and the side windows can be opened to 
increase airflow. The front windows, meanwhile, 
feature an angular, weatherproof door, to enable 
the crew to access the vessel via the bow, and 
which can also be used for forward boarding 
through the bow cockpit. The MTV 55’s bow is 
fitted with a folding bow ramp for beach loading. 
AMD explains: “Once lifted, the ramp becomes 
an integral part of the bridge deck.”
The vessel’s hulls are described as being fairly 
typical for planing catamarans, and of the 
symmetrical type.  Vertical accelerations are 
reduced, approximately by 30-50%, compared 
to similar monohull vessels, thus enabling the 
cat to perform a wider range of tasks and to 
maintain higher speeds at given sea states. The 
MTV 55’s hull structure is fashioned from 
composites, using vacuum infusion, with 
sandwich panels covering the vessel’s bottom, 
sides, deck, wet deck and superstructure. 
AMD’s design for this craft is compliant with 
Germanischer Lloyd’s (GL’s) 2012 rules for 
high-speed craft. The bow section below 
waterline is bolstered by a foam-packed 
‘collision block’, to provide an added layer of 
protection in the event of an accident. As an 
additional safety-related measure, the craft has 
been divided into compartments by watertight 
bulkheads, to ensure that, should one 
compartment become damaged, the vessel will 
remain afloat – buying both crew and 
passengers valuable time to evacuate.

U
pon delivery to the Royal Netherlands Navy 
(RNLN) last year, Noordzee represented the 
first in a series of three of Damen’s ASD Tug 2810 
Hybrid models, selected for performance as well 
as environmental sustainability. The two follow-
up sister vessels – namely Waddenzee and 
Zuiderzee – were delivered in Q1 and Q2 2016 
respectively. 
The RNLN was reportedly looking for a 
standard tug that was very environmentally 
friendly, albeit also being powerful enough to 
undertake heavy operations. The ASD Tug 2810 
Hybrid utilises two rudder propeller units for 
optimum manoeuvrability and is able to sail on 
full electric power, via a set of batteries, or in 
diesel mode, care of her two MTU main engines. 
When full pull is required, both MTU engines 
are deployed, granting the tug a top bollard pull 
(bp) of 60tonnes – a considerable increase on the 
22tonnes bp-rated, Linge-class RNLN tugs which 
this trio has replaced.  When sailing under diesel 
power, meanwhile, the vessels within the Damen 
ASD Tug 2810 Hybrid class are able to store any 
electrical energy that is not immediately being 
used in its battery pack. As such, this energy can 
be used for onboard hotel applications / operating 
systems, or saved for use when the tug switches to 
electric sailing mode. 
Post-delivery, Damen Shipyards is also 
responsible for the maintenance of these three 
vessels – a task that has previously been handled 
by the RNLN in-house – thus reflecting growing 
expectations for after-sales customer support as a 
key part of the overall newbuild contract.

P
acific Titan comprises a shallow-draught utility 
tug, designed in tandem by owner East Coast 
Maritime and architect Sea Transport, and built at 
Malaysia’s Hung Seng Shipbuilding. The vessel was 
purpose-built to support operations such as dredging, 
marine construction, barge-handling / anchor-
handling and towage. 
Her hull is a double-chine, high-displacement, low-
dead rise and shallow-draught design, which 
incorporates propulsion tunnels. The bow features a 
straight stem and a balanced entry for stability and 
ocean-going voyages. For optimal strength and 
reduced vibrations, the hull has been encircled by a 
central longitudinal double ring from stern to stern, 
and features a dense grid of longitudinal and transverse 
frames throughout the engine room.  
The vessel is a conventional twin-screw design, 
powered by two Yanmar 6EY17W engines. 
Gearboxes are island-mounted Yanmar YXH500L 
models with an output ratio of 4.96:1. The vessel’s 
main engine shafts, rudder stocks and stern roller shaft 
have been fabricated from 2205 stainless steel.
Nickel-aluminium-bronze propellers were supplied 
by Veem Australia and are a 4-blade skewed Kaplan 
design, housed in 1,880mm Rice Thrust Nozzles. The 
vessel is equipped with a hydraulically driven 
Nakashima TFN-100S bow thruster, supplying 
2tonnes of thrust. 
The hydraulic system was designed and supplied by 
HES Winches Australia. Hydraulic power is supplied 
by a 257kW Yanmar 6HA2M-WHT. The diesel 
hydraulic power unit is fitted with two pumps: one 
running the bow thruster, the other running a ‘ring-
main’ for the deck machinery. An emergency electric-
hydraulic power unit is available as an back-up for the 
deck machinery. Pacific Titan also employs a system 
of Weka Box Coolers to cool all five engines. 
Ploughing equipment consists of twin plough arms 
with a working load limit (WLL) of 15tonnes each. 
Each plough arm is fitted with a Dinamic Oil winch. 
The plough is held in position laterally using twin side 
stays, which are adjusted using the custom quad-gypsy 
anchor windlass designed and fabricated by HES 
Winches Australia.
Accommodation is Maritime Labour Convention- 
compliant. The fit-out of the wheelhouse was 
completed using lightweight Ayres aluminium 
honeycomb panels, Dampa ceiling panels and 
adhesive glass from Sealed Marine Windows. The 
forward and aft helm stations feature custom cockpit-
style dash panels and Norsap helm chairs. Heating and 
cooling is supplied by twin Daikin air-con units. The 
wheelhouse has individual temperature controls, as 
does each crew cabin.

B
uilt by Dubai-based Triangle Shipyard, the 
all-aluminium PETRA-1 represents the first 
in an all-new class of 45m-long fast offshore 
support vessels (FOSVs). Delivered to operator 
Marine Core & Charter in February 2016, the 
vessel type was developed, in designer Camarc’s 
words, to “provide a step change in the crew boat 
market, in terms of speed, fuel efficiency, crew 
comfort and payload”. 
The FOSV45 features a specifically developed 
hull design, evolved from Camarc’s double chine 
hull concept, for enhanced efficiency and 
comfort relative to more conventional crew boat 
designs. Tank testing in the UK has led to this 
hull form displaying a refined shape forward, 
resulting in improvements in efficiencies and 
vertical accelerations  – and, subsequently, 
improved fuel economy and onboard comfort. 
The vertical bow shape forward is above water 
only: in this way, waterline length can be 
maximised while maintaining the crew boat’s 
all-round seakeeping ability. 
As another concession to crew and passenger 
comfort, Camarc and Triangle have managed 
to restrict PETRA-1’s onboard noise levels 
below the 65dBA mark. The superstructure 
was designed to provide superior roll angle 
tolerance – for instance, specific fendering 
and recessed windows were incorporated into 
the craft’s design, for added protection when 
she is alongside. However, the FOSV45 
concept remains a flexible one, in terms of 
design. 
Camarc 
adds: 
“Alternative 
configurations with more conventional side 
decks are available as an option should that be 
a particular operator’s preference.” 
PETRA-1 has been built to full Bureau Veritas 
class with an unrestricted navigation notation. 
Redundancy has been fully factored into the 
design: the vessel features twin bow thrusters, 
twin anchors, triple generators and independent 
steering. The vessel has also been fitted with an 
integrated navigation system (INS), complete 
with large displays for improved control and 
monitoring from the bridge and enabling 
internal communications between stations. The 
systems fitted are fully compliant with sea area 
A3 GMDSS requirements. 
PETRA-1 has the capacity to accommodate up 
to 100 offshore workers/passengers, with room 
for an additional 12 VIPs. Overall, her 
deadweight capacity is rated 160tonnes. The 
deck area is sized 140m², strengthened to 
2tonnes per m², enabling a maximum cargo load 
of 85tonnes. The FOSV has the capacity to store 
up to 100,000litres of fuel and 24,000litres of 
water. Meanwhile, Heila supplied PETRA-1’s 
crane; an HLM 170-4S unit, capable of lifting 
6tonnes at an outreach of 2.5m and 1tonne at 
12m. The crane is centred on the deck, enabling 
crew to move deck cargo around as required.

P
rotector, the first in Robert Allan Limited’s 
(RAL’s) RAnger V-3300 class, could serve as a 
good demonstrator of the shift in expectations 
placed upon modern fireboats. Such vessels are 
increasingly being relied upon to serve as incident 
command centres, capable of responding to local 
emergencies, instead of being viewed as mere fire 
pump-equipped workboats. 
The 32.9m loa Protector and its forthcoming RAnger 
V-3300 sisters (the second-in-class Vigilance is 
expected in mid-2017) feature Voith cycloidal drives in 
a tractor configuration, which, RAL claims, grants this 
class a high degree of manoeuvrability and the ability 
to tackle fires in a number of environmental conditions. 
Given this remit, high speed was put on the back 
burner; instead, RAL used its in-house CFD 
capabilities to optimise the hull form to result in 
minimal wake when travelling ahead and astern at 
8knots, as well as to provide good seakeeping ability in 
foul weather. 
These new fireboats are also equipped with 
chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear 
(CBRN) defence capabilities, including a citadel 
enclosure with specialised HVAC filters, a 
decontamination shower and chemical detectors. 
Aboard, one finds a ‘Command Information Center’, 
which enables crew to perform on-scene command 
duties and to communicate with other agencies and 
emergency responders. 
In terms of firefighting capacity, each RAnger 
V-3300 craft features an aggregate pumping capacity of 
186,390litres per minute. The vessels can also provide 
more than 136,380litres of water shore-side via 4 inch 
hoses, to support land-based firefighting operations.

T
asked with making daily trips across the 38nm of 
deep ocean that separate the Caribbean islands of St 
Croix and St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands, the 
passenger ferry QE IV is described by builder Gold 
Coast Yachts as having succeeded “where all predecessors 
had failed”. 
Although a seemingly undaunting distance, the route 
between the islands is subject to extremely volatile sea 
conditions. Coupled with strong passenger demand, 
this has proven a challenge too much for the large 
conventional ferries, hydrofoils, sea planes and 
catamarans that have attempted to provide this service 
in the past. As Gold Coast Yachts puts it: “The 
prevailing wind and wave direction on the route places 
the vessel in a beam-on wave orientation for the majority 
of days in operation”. 
QE IV was subsequently influenced by multihull 
vessel design, adapted to introduce a tandem-
catamaran hull form so as to optimise fuel 
consumption whilst improving sea motion. Four 
hulls have been placed in a ‘2+2’ arrangement, with 
a large span between the forward and aft pairs, at 
the behest of owner Warren Mosler. Gold Coast 
Yachts adds: “By removing displacement from the 
centre, both transversely and longitudinally, the 
vessel has a reduced tendency to react to head and 
beam seas, as well as reducing wetted surface and 
hull weight.” This is not without its own challenges 
– for instance, by grouping four hulls closely 
together, one encounters additional complexity in 
hull-wave interactions and cross structuring – but 
CFD and small-scale modelling lend credence to the 
concept overall. 
To further reduce weight, QE IV’s components 
were fashioned from carbon fibre – resulting in an 
approximate vessel weight of just 14tonnes. “FEA 
was used to analyse the loading in the monococque 
structure, which was then calibrated with 
measurements from strain gauges during sea trials,” 
Gold Coast Yachts explains. 
For optimal passenger comfort, QE IV features 
round windows, two aft heads and six 4.4kW air-
con units. The helm has been positioned forward for 
enhanced visibility in the wheelhouse, and to grant 
the captain “maximum experience of ship motion 
and accelerations”, so that the passengers are not 
adversely affected by sudden adjustments in vessel 
course and/or speed.

elivered in July 2016, the 26.2m x 8.5m, 
aluminium 
patrol 
boat 
sisters 
Ratayapibanbancha and Arcarachwaratorn were 
constructed by Bangkok-based builder Seacrest 
Marine to a design based on Incat Crowther’s  
24m ‘Reef Ranger’ catamaran. This previous 
aluminium vessel originally entered service in 
2014, providing protection to Australia’s famous 
and environmentally sensitive Great Barrier 
Reef. However, the Thai duo will instead focus 
on border protection and long-range and coastal 
patrol duties, as well as transporting dignitaries 
in a safe manner. 
Each boat features a large aft working deck, 
which houses a 4.5m fast rescue craft. Forward 
of this is the main deck cabin, which includes a 
fully featured galley to starboard and a wet room 
to port. Forward of the hull access, one finds an 
eight-man dormitory and a large mess and 
dining area. 
Two large cabins, dedicated to the senior 
offices, are located upstairs, next to a private 
living area, while below decks reveals another 
two cabins for crew members, in addition to 
pump rooms and equipment/storage space. 
Meanwhile, visibility is optimised inside the 
wheelhouse care of forward-raked windows. 
Personnel comfort was another important 
consideration. Incat Crowther states: “The 
application of underwater main engine exhaust 
outlets ensures very low ambient noise levels 
throughout the vessels and surrounding 
environment.” 
Each vessel is equipped with twin MAN 12V 
D2862 main engines, rated 1,213kW apiece, 
which additionally come with Humphree 
interceptors, for reduced roll in volatile  
sea conditions. 
Before the vessels were handed over, sea trials 
proved particularly illuminating; when put 
through their paces, both newbuilds managed to 
attain a loaded speed of 32knots and a cruise 
speed range of 1,000 miles.

P
roving that the British still have the knack for 
innovative fast ferry construction, the 
delivery of Red Jet 6 has been hailed as a 
significant milestone for the UK boatbuilding 
industry, representing the first high-speed 
passenger ferry to have been constructed 
domestically in just over 15 years. 
The US$8.5 million, all-aluminium catamaran, 
which was formally delivered in July 2016, was 
built on the Isle of Wight by Shemara Refit (now 
Wight Shipyard Co.), working from leased facilities 
at Venture Quays in East Cowes. Although 
previously specialising in vessel repairs and refits, 
WSC has now announced its intention, following 
the completion of Red Jet 6, to bring ferry 
construction back to the UK – reviving a tradition 
that seemed to have become obsolete in late 2000, 
following the closure of the then active FBM 
Marine yard in Cowes, a celebrated factory for 
numerous vessels delivered to Greece, Portugal, 
Hong Kong and Asia throughout the 1990s.  
Red Jet 6 was based on a design supplied by 
Australia’s One2three Naval Architects. Red Jet 6 
has since entered service under the management 
of operator Red Funnel Ferries, ploughing a route 
between Southampton, on the UK mainland, and 
Cowes, on the Isle of Wight. The company’s Red 
Jet service carries more than 1.1 million 
passengers each year. 
There are a number of ways in which Red Jet 6 
builds on her predecessor, Red Jet 4, which was 
built in 2003 by Australia-based North West Bay 
Ships. For instance, Red Jet 6 incorporates four 
MTU engines instead of Red Jet 4’s twin-engine 
arrangement, in order to achieve greater 
efficiency and redundancy, for minimal potential 
disruption to sailing schedules. As Peter Morton, 
Shemara Refit chief executive, put it when Red Jet 
6 was delivered: “If the need arises, the engines 
can be shut down individually and the ferry can 
maintain the service running on three engines 
with only minor reduction in speed.”
Propulsive power is also marginally stronger 
than that of Red Jet 4, clocking in at 3,600kW 
compared to 3,500kW. This arrangement grants 
Red Jet 6 the ability to complete a typical 
Southampton-to-Cowes 
crossing 
in 
approximately 23 minutes. 
Red Funnel Ferries also estimates that Red Jet 6’s 
levels of fuel consumption should prove to be 11% 
less compared to those of her predecessor. This has 
been achieved partly by the engines and waterjets 
combination, and partly by the application of Teflon 
coatings to her hull, to minimise drag. Also, a special 
vinyl wrap has been used for the ferry’s superstructure, 
which, the operator states, should prove effective in 
reducing weight and overall maintenance costs when 
compared to conventional paints. 
The passenger lounge has been insulated from the 
twin hulls via the incorporation of resilient 
mountings, to curb noise and vibration levels. 
The engines and the associated gearboxes have 
been laid out in pairs between the ferry’s twin hulls, 
with the machinery in each hull being of a staggered 
configuration, with long and shorter shaft lines 
connecting to each pair of waterjets.

elivered in August 2016, articulated tug 
barge (ATB) unit Sea Power was designed 
by Guido Perla & Associates, Incorporated 
(GPA) and customised for the shipowner’s 
specific operational requirements.
Constructed at BAE Systems, Sea Power is the 
first ATB tug designed and built for SEACOR. 
She has subsequently been ‘married’ to the barge 
Sea Chem-I, a 176.78m x 23.77m, 180,000bbl 
barge that was constructed at DonJon Marine’s 
Erie Shipbuilding, in Erie, Pennsylvania. 
Sea Power herself has an overall length of 
42.98m, a draught of 6.75 m and a breadth of 
14m, with accommodation for 12 crew members. 
According to GPA, what distinguishes Sea Power 
from other ATB tugs is her power, 
manoeuvrability, high levels of crew comfort 
and environmental compatibility. Not only does 
she perform in the top tier as a pusher, but she 
also does so while minimising ecological impact. 
With twin 8-cylinder, Wärtsilä W8L32 diesel 
engines, Wärtsilä SCV95 reduction gears and 
twin propellers, she is rated 8,948kW and 
features a top solo speed of 15knots and a service 
speed of 12knots. To carry her payload, she has 
also been designed with an INTERCON 50 PIN 
connector system (engaged force generated 
136tonnes) and Van Der Velden Barke High-Lift 
rudders for superior manoeuvrability and 
course-keeping. 
Sea Power’s internal electrical power comes 
from two 250kW Marathon 433PSL6216 main 
generator sets and a third auxiliary 250kW 
Marathon 433PSL6216 generator set.
Along with her ergonomic design, spacious 
crew quarters and berths, GPA performed 
extensive noise and vibration analysis to ensure 
a smooth and quiet vessel for crew comfort. 
Ecologically, Sea Power is also equipped with 
an internal recirculating liquid ballast system. 
This assists the vessel in minimising her impact 
on underwater noise pollution  – thereby 
reducing  the frequency and likelihood of ill 
effects on sea life in waterways – and is able to 
minimise pumping overboard, lowering the risk 
of ecological contamination. 
GPA adds: “Sea Power also utilises Wärtsilä’s 
Sternguard system for her propulsion shafts. 
Sternguard is a contained system which seals in 
and purifies the unique biodegradable 
lubrication oil.”

alued at US$3.5 million, the 25.7m dredger 
Selkie emerged from Macduff Shipyards’ 
Buckie facilities in North-East Scotland in May 
2016, whereupon she was handed over to Moray 
Council. Macduff Ship Design secured the 
competitive tender to design the vessel in 2015, via 
the European Union (EU) tender process, and the 
completed dredger replaces the 1968-built 
Shearwater, taking over her role of servicing 
harbours administered by Moray Council – 
including Buckie, Burghead, Hopeman, Findochty, 
Portknockie and Cullen – as well as offering her 
services to other harbours located in the north and 
east of Scotland. 
	 Selkie was specifically designed to cope with the 
small harbours that are encountered on the Moray 
coast, most of which feature narrow entrances. As 
such, Macduff designed the vessel with a relatively 
narrow beam of 8.2m and a moulded depth of 3.4m. 
	 The vessel has been fitted with an excavator unit, 
supplied by Liebherr, which has been built to a 
marine specification and is mounted on the deck. 
This excavator has the capability to dredge at depths 
down to 8m below waterline. 
	 Selkie is also fitted with a pair of spud legs, 
enabling her to position herself as a stable 
platform when in harbour. The legs are 
controlled by two spud leg winches, each rated 
10tonnes, which can be controlled both locally 
and from the wheelhouse. Other deck equipment 
includes two capstans and an anchor windlass. 
	 The vessel has been classed by the UK 
Maritime & Coastguard Agency (MCA) to 
accommodate a three-man crew, with a galley 
and messing facilities, three single cabins, WC 
facilities and a laundry area. Macduff Ship 
Design notes: “The hopper itself can hold up to 
147m³ of dredge spoil at a maximum specific 
gravity of 1.80.”
	 Propulsion-wise, the vessel benefits from a 
set-up of two CAT C18 Acert engines, coupled 
to a pair of Twin Disc MGX -516 gearboxes 
and two auxiliary C4.4 engines. Selkie’s 
propulsion systems were supplied by Kort 
Propulsion, with 1,500mm propellers and a 
KT 150 bow thruster, while her steering gear 
was supplied by Wills Ridley.

itting the waves just on the other side of New 
Year, the 2017-launched Shi Zi Yang 7 was built 
by Wang Tak, with design assistance sourced from 
Guangdong Hongshen Shipbuilding & Engineering 
and Incat Crowther. The 199-passenger ferry has 
been designed to compete in the cut-throat Chinese 
ferry market, and to satisfy this market’s requirements 
for high speed and high levels of passenger comfort. 
The vessel has been tasked with operations in the 
Pearl River Delta, between Hong Kong and Macau. 
Despite her colourful and eye-catching livery, the 
vessel’s core selling point is her efficient hull form. 
Incat Crowther states: “An effectively laid-out deck 
plan keeps superstructure to a minimum, with hull 
cross structure eliminated where not required.” This 
is coupled with a semi-SWATH hull form. Both hull 
and superstructure have been fashioned from 
lightweight alluminium alloy. 
Shi Zi Yang 7’s main boarding zones have been 
situated port and starboard aft. Utilising these, 
passengers enter the main cabin via an area that 
houses the 10-man crew’s mess, bathrooms, luggage 
racks and a small kiosk. Further forward, one enters 
the main cabin, which has been designed for optimal 
light, and which features 139 passenger seats. A pair 
of VIP cabins are located at the aft outboard sides of 
this cabin, each seating four persons. 
Passengers can ascend by stair to the upper deck, 
which houses the business class cabin, complete with 
52 seats. Forward of this, one encounters the 
wheelhouse, which has been designed with external 
bridge wing stations for enhanced visibility and 
manoeuvrability. Shi Zi Yang 7 has also been equipped 
with six life rafts: two featuring the capacity for 65 
persons each, and four designed for 25 persons 
apiece. Searchlights, floodlights, navigation lights and 
lighting fixtures have been installed for both internal 
and external vessel usage, as has a CCTV system.

escribed by its designer and builder as a 
‘Swiss army knife’, the multi-purpose 
monohull/single-chine Alusafe 1500 MPV 
Skansen was developed to fulfil a wide range of 
assignments – from towing and oil spill response 
to firefighting operations –  along the coast, as 
well as in the harbour and along the the quay 
fronts of the Ålesund/Sunnmøre region of 
Norway. The vessel has received approval 
according to the new regulations for coastal 
vessels and for oil spill response duties, and is 
also fully equipped to assist the fire department 
in firefighting and rescue-diving operations. 
This new workboat has been given the same 
name as the previous, outgoing Port Authority 
workboat, Skansen, which had been operating in 
the Ålesund region since 1975. According to 
Anders Bjørdal, port captain of the Port Authority 
of Ålesund: “Improved stability and high towing 
capacity makes Skansen an important part of our 
emergency preparedness, especially with regards 
to acute pollution situations.”
Skansen is certified for oil pollution response 
operations, and is equipped with high towing 
capacity for towing oil booms. It is also fitted 
with a water cannon for firefighting operations.
On the foredeck, the vessel is equipped with a 
3tonne-capacity capstan winch and a crane with a 
lifting capacity of 4.5tonnes. The reinforced deck 
can withstand concentrated loads, and is 
approved for carrying cargo up to a weight of 
5tonnes, enabling the crew to load heavy 
equipment needed for various operations and to 
collect heavy objects floating in the water.
This large load capacity, in addition to a 
hydraulically operated bow ramp, means the 
vessel can operate as a transportation platform 
for heavy machinery – such as all-terrain 
vehicles, fire engines or police patrol cars – to 
otherwise inaccessible areas. The bow ramp, 
which can be remotely operated from the 
helmsman’s position at the bridge, enables the 
crew to deploy oil booms from the deck. The aft 
deck is fitted with one additional capstan winch, 
with 1tonne pulling capacity, and a remote-
released towing hook, operated from the 
helmsman’s position at the bridge.
The Alusafe 1500 MPV is constructed from 
aluminum and features a fiberglass sandwich 
superstructure, mounted on dampeners to reduce 
noise and vibrations from the engine room to the 
wheelhouse. The wheelhouse is arranged with a 
small pantry, and a seating area with room for six 
people, thus seating eight people in the 
wheelhouse in total. A locker room with sinks 
and toilet facilities is located below deck. 
Maritime Partner has claimed that the 
multipurpose nature of this vessel type means 
that it could also be deployed as a support vessel 
for fish farms and diving operations, for example.

A
s San Francisco’s first new fireboat in 61 years, 
St Francis (formerly Fireboat 3) has been hailed 
as both a high-end firefighting solution and a 
mobile pumping station “powerhouse”. Designed by 
Jensen and built by Vigor, the 26.8m loa vessel is 
capable of pumping millions of gallons of water 
directly from San Francisco Bay into the city’s 
auxiliary water system – an act to ensure that, 
should an earthquake cause damage to San 
Francisco’s water mains, onshore firefighters will be 
able to rely on the vessel for a steady flow of water.  
This consideration reflects one of the most serious 
infrastructural challenges affecting earthquake-
prone zones, and serves as a reminder of the 
October 1989 Loma Prieta quake, which burst San 
Francisco’s subterranean domestic water lines. 
Speaking at the time of her delivery, Keith 
Whittemore, Vigor’s executive vice president for 
business development, commented: “St Francis is a 
complex vessel with multiple modes of operation 
and different systems that need to communicate 
with each other seamlessly to give the City’s 
firefighters the best possible tool for the future.”
Cummins was largely responsible for the 
fireboat’s critical pumping and propulsion power. 
A trio of QSK19-M US EPA Tier 3 engines provide 
559kW@1,800rpm and feed Counterfire ESF 300-
550 fire pumps with a capacity for 27,276litres per 
minute each – or a total of 81,830litres per minute 
of flow with all three engines in pumping mode. 
Power is transmitted to the pumps via three Logan 
LC318 SAE #0 air actuated clutches and Elbe 
cardan shafts with a Centa Centaflex-R flywheel 
-mounted torsional coupling.
In a bid to significantly reduce noise and 
vibrations, the designer also mounted St Francis’ 
three engines on Christie & Grey TSC T-10 
vibration isolators.

A
s the first of two 14.9m service vessels 
constructed by Turkish boatbuilder RMK 
Marine to a design provided by Scotland’s Macduff 
Ship Design, the 39gt T. Servis 1 was delivered to 
her local, Turkish owner (whose identity has 
remained confidential) in February 2016 – shortly 
followed by sister vessel, T. Servis 2. This duo was 
part of a wider order coordinated between Macduff 
and the Tuzla-based yard for a selection of 
newbuilds for the same owner, including five 10.1m 
mooring tugs and two 19m shallow-draught ASD 
tugs. 
T. Servis 1’s prime remit is to serve as a multi-role 
harbour service boat, able to carry a maximum 
complement of 10 persons as well as 5tonnes of 
cargo on the aft deck. Cargo is transported onboard 
independently, without the need for external 
assistance, courtesy of a small, Toimil-supplied 
marine crane, rated 0.7tonnes at 6.85m and 
positioned aft. 
In terms of capacity, T. Servis 1 and her sister can 
each carry up to 2,270litres of fuel oil, 500litres of 
fresh water and 330litres of black water. 
The vessel is powered by twin Volvo Penta D16-
750 main engines, rated 552kW at 1,900rpm apiece, 
driving propellers through Twin Disc MG 5145 
gearboxes. For enhanced speed and seakeeping, T. 
Servis 1 has also incorporated Humphree active 
interceptors into her arrangement. 
At the time of delivery, Ian Ellis, managing 
director of Macduff, commented: “[Our] biggest 
design challenge was the required 16knot service 
speed, in light of the vessel’s relatively low power 
and the ability to carry 10 crew and personnel, have 
a pushing capability and accommodate space for the 
cargo and crane.”

S
lightly more compact than her predecessor 
Eddy 1 (see Significant Small Ships of 2014, 
pages 26 and 27), the compact, 25m Telstar, which 
was delivered in October 2016, is a further refined 
version of the hybrid-driven ‘Efficient, Dynamic, 
Double-Ended’ tug (EDDY Tug) concept, which 
aligns azimuthing thrusters, one under the prow 
and one under the stern, to realise a vessel capable 
of high-precision manoeuvring and the ability to 
exert full thrust in any direction. 
As with Eddy 1, Telstar was built at Holland 
Shipyards to the specs of the EDDY 24-75 design. 
The vessel was delivered to Iskes Towage & Salvage 
in the Port of IJmuiden – an ideal location to test 
the tug’s manoeuvrability. The design also allows 
for towing pins to be fitted on the aft bulwark, to 
assist with control when encountering narrow lock 
and bridge passages. Stability is an important 
consideration given that lock transits are a key part 
of the Iskes harbour towage business. 
Telstar is powered by two Mitsubishi main 
engines and two permanent magnet electric 
motors. The vessel also features the Veth Hybrid 
Drive (VHD) system manufactured by Veth 
Propulsion, which supplied the vessel’s Z-drive 
VZ1800 VHD thrusters, Scania Dl16 gensets and a 
Sisu harbour set. 
The tug’s hybrid arrangement incorporates 
diesel-direct and diesel-electric inputs to the 
thrusters. The electric motors, rated 600kW 
each, are powered by the two 640kW Scania 
gensets. A transit speed of 8knots can be attained 
using one generator, and 10knots on two. The 
bollard pull of 75tonnes in diesel-direct mode is 
measured at 30tonnes in ‘e-mode’. Operating in 
‘e-mode’ could help to slash fuel costs and 
emissions by 50%, depending on the port of 
operations, whilst also reducing main diesel 
engine running hours, lowering maintenance 
costs. When more power is required in e-mode 
(for push-pull and active assist operations, for 
example) the operator can add the power of the 
diesel-direct input for extra kick.

O
ffshore wind farm support vessels face 
working environments within deeper waters, 
and in more far-flung locations, than has been 
the case to date, and, as such, vessel seakeeping 
ability has become as important as, if not more 
important than, speed. 
As the first of a series of four crew transfer 
vessels (CTVs) built to yield maximum days at 
sea, Tempest’s focus is not solely on transit speed 
– although the 22.5m loa boat is capable of 
achieving  a top speed of 28knots – but on its 
ability to stand firm against rough weather and 
waves. The craft’s 1.4m draught, combined with a 
high waterline, provides ample room for the 
waves to pass between her hulls, thus preventing 
slamming and increasing the vessel’s personnel 
transfer capability. 
Waterjets were selected for enhanced 
manoeuvrability and thrust. The Rolls-Royce 
Kamewa models chosen come with compact 
reversing buckets which can deliver up to 70% of 
the normal forward thrust, resulting in enhanced 
transit efficiency and the ability to keep the CTV 
pushed onto the tower in high sea states. 
To reduce the likelihood of unplanned 
downtime, Tempest has adopted MTU’s 
BlueVision propulsion monitoring system. Rob 
Stewart, commercial director at AMC, adds that 
the bridge has been fitted with state-of-the-art 
navigation and communication solutions, 
incorporating “some unique features at the 
request of the client”. 
A set of Cummins Onan MDKBV units were 
chosen to provide onboard power, mainly due to 
their reported low sound and vibration profile, 
AMC says. The vessel superstructure has been 
resiliently mounted, granting Tempest’s 
technician complement a relatively smooth and 
quiet transit, with KPM shock-mitigating seats 
playing their part in boosting passenger comfort. 
Although Tempest’s second and third ‘sister’ vessels 
are some 2m smaller in length than the debutant, all 
four vessels in this series have been simultaneously in 
build with staggered delivery dates. AMC says: “The 
installations are almost identical, allowing a 
completely interchangeable crewing which is 
providing a huge benefit to the client.”

C
ompleted just a year after contract signing, the 
futuristic sightseeing catamaran Vision of the 
Fjords has commenced services on Norway’s 
UNESCO World Heritage-listed Nærøyfjord. The 
40m, carbon-fibre ferry was developed with the 
intent of causing minimal impact on her ecologically 
sensitive surroundings whilst providing a first rate 
tourist experience. Designed and built in western 
Norway by Brødrene Aa, Vision of the Fjords is 
unique as a hybrid diesel/battery electric-powered, 
twin-hull vessel, and is described as a ‘parallel 
hybrid’ due to the fact that her electric and diesel 
engines can be run independently of each other, or 
can power the propellers together, with seamless 
transition between modes. 
The vessel is operated by Norwegian tourist boat 
operator The Fjords, between Flam and Gudvangen, 
with a top speed of 18knots. However, when reaching 
the sensitive Nærøyfjord waters, she switches to pure 
battery power at a speed of approximately 8knots, 
engaging in emissions-free, silent running. The 
battery pack is charged by the engines or from a 
shoreside supply, and a compact version of ABB’s 
Onboard DC Grid system is responsible for 
managing the energy flow between the diesel 
machinery, propellers and battery charging station. 
The ferry’s exterior lines were designed to resemble 
a twisting mountain path, granting passengers full 
freedom of movement up and around the entire 
vessel. The catamaran is certified for 400 passengers, 
accommodated across two decks, and her twin hulls 
were designed with a very high prismatic coefficient, 
so as to minimise wake and lessen wave-induced 
erosion on the fjords’ narrow shores. 
Vision of the Fjords’ parallel hybrid propulsion 
system was engineered by Mancraft of Bergen, 
Germany. This system incorporates two drivelines, 
each consisting of a diesel engine, coupling/clutch 
combination, electric motor and generator 
combination with flexible connectors on each side, 
and advanced torque measuring equipment and 
monitoring for the respective operating modes. 
A pair of 12-cylinder MAN D2862 LE422 engines, 
each producing 749kW at 2,100rpm, provides diesel 
power. In each case, power is transmitted via a 
Centa electro-magnetic clutch through a Centalink 
drive shaft to an Oswald permanent-magnet electric 
motor. The diesel and electric engines can power the 
propellers together, or independently; in diesel 
mode, full engine power can be directed through 
the Oswald electric motor to the ZF gearbox and 
West Mekan controllable-pitch propeller. The 
Oswald synchronous machines can also function as 
alternators, at a 200kW rating, to charge the 
batteries, drawing on excess power available from 
the diesels.  
The battery packs are installed in the twin hulls. 
The 576kWh energy storage system uses lithium-ion 
nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells and modules 
from LG Chem, adapted for maritime use by Hovik-
based system contractor ZEM. During sightseeing in 
the most picturesque sections of the fjord, or for trips 
in harbour, Vision of the Fjords is driven solely by 
battery-fed electric motor propulsion, with an 
endurance of up to three hours in this mode. 
Vision of the Fjords is undertaking a year-round 
schedule and is expected to make about 700 journeys 
per annum.

D
esigned to perform as a multi-function 
patrol boat for Belgium Customs, Zeeleeuw 
(or ‘sea lion’) is the first vessel to incorporate 
Estonia-based Baltic Workboats’ new advanced 
wave-piercing 
design, 
which 
has 
been 
developed to enable high-speed travel across a 
range of sea and weather conditions. This 
design has been named the Patrol 2200 WP and 
Baltic Workboats intends to use it as the 
building block for a number of scalable / 
customisable future patrol boats.
Speed and stability aside, Zeeleeuw’s more 
notable features include extreme attention to 
noise reduction; the designer and builder was 
able to limit wheelhouse noise levels to 62dBA 
when the craft is travelling at her maximum 
speed of 23knots, or between 60-61dBA when the 
boat is in the 19-21knots bracket. The wheelhouse 
has been positioned centrally; this permits 
Zeeleeuw’s crew to safely launch a 5m RIB from 
the aft ramp at speeds of up to 8knots. 
Zeeleeuw has also managed to avoid earning a 
reputation as a gas guzzler; instead, the vessel 
consumes fuel at a rate of approximately 133litres 
per hour when travelling at 20knots. The craft’s 
powertrain comprises two Volvo Penta D16 MH 
engines driving five-bladed, fixed-pitch 
propellers through ZF marine gearboxes. 
The vessel has been equipped with two radars: a 
Simrad Argus model, to be utilised at sea, and a 
Furuno radar, for deployment in riverine 
conditions. Both interface with twin 24” 
widescreen displays which can also be used for 
ECDIS, Baltic Workboats confirms.
