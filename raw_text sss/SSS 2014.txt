W
e commence this year’s round of Significant 
Small Ships with one of the most talked-
about vessels of 2014, the recipient of a few ‘ship 
of the year’ awards and a true example of 
technical innovation. Ampere may be better 
known to Ship & Boat International readers by 
her class moniker, namely that of ‘ZeroCat 120’; 
the all-electric, 350-pax / 120-car ferry 
developed to run solely on battery power, which 
lives up to her descriptor by cutting emissions to 
practically zero. 
Given the implications of the aptly named 
Ampere’s features, it would have seemed churlish 
to deny the vessel a spot in this year’s publication, 
due to her planned December 2014 delivery date 
being held back by a few weeks. Delivered to 
operator Norled in January 2015, the ferry will 
play a crucial role in bolstering Norway’s north/
south transport infrastructure, providing a link 
between Lavik and Oppedal on the country’s 
E39 coastal highway.
Built with an aluminium catamaran hullform, 
Ampere utilises lithium ion batteries and a 
Siemens battery technology system to power 
Siemens electric motors, which drive Rolls-
Royce-manufactured, 
Azimuth 
pulling 
propellers (Azipulls). As well as resulting in low 
noise and vibration levels, this arrangement will 
eliminate all NOx, CO2, methane and 
greenhouse gases emissions. Siemens has 
estimated that the switch to all-electric 
propulsion could eliminate up to 3,000tonnes of 
CO2 emissions annually, for this vessel alone. 
The vessel’s power train was designed by 
Fjellstrand and incorporates Siemens’ battery 
technology, using modules developed by 
Canada’s Corvus Energy. Two battery systems 
have been installed, each located at either end 
of the ferry; together, these weigh approximately 
10tonnes yet deliver a combined 1,000kW  
of power. 
This output is deemed sufficient to feed 
Ampere’s operational requirements, including 
the powering of her dual 450kW electric 
propulsion motors and her onboard electrical 
systems. Siemens estimates that a battery power 
of 400kW should suffice for each 20-minute 
crossing between Lavik and Oppedal. 
Battery recharging will be conducted whilst 
the vessel is berthed; each ferry pier on Ampere’s 
route has been fitted with a 260kWh battery 
pack, connected to the grid, which will replenish 
the vessel’s energy stocks during her turnaround 
periods. It is estimated that just 10 minutes will 
prove a sufficient timeframe for onboard energy 
top-ups. 
Poland’s Aluship Technology handled the 
construction of Ampere’s hull, which has been 
optimised to avoid excessive battery drain and 
for enhanced hydrodynamic properties. 
Additionally, Rolls-Royce AZP 085 propulsors 
were selected to compliment this arrangement. 
These units feature a low propeller rotation rate 
and propeller blades with high aspect ratio and a 
low blade area. 
Each Azipull propeller can also be feathered. It 
is believed that, instead of dividing power 
between each thruster, the stern propulsor will 
bear the brunt of most of the task work, guiding 
the ferry’s direction, while the forward thruster 
sets its propeller blades to a feathered position, 
to curb drag. The thrusters can be rotated on the 
return journey to reverse roles.
In all, the example set by Ampere is one that is 
sure to be emulated on ferry and short-sea 
shipping routes in years to come, and proves 
that is possible to run a green craft service 
without breaking the bank, nor sacrificing 
operational efficiency.

A
s a relatively low-cost alternative to helicopter 
airlifts, demand for waterborne ambulance 
services is growing across communities based in 
far-flung and remote locations. For the 
inhabitants of areas comprising clusters of 
islands, or interlaced with river estuaries, it is 
essential to have some means of getting to the 
nearest mainland hospital, which can be situated, 
in the case of some coastal regions, hundreds of 
miles away. This is true whether the water 
ambulance is used to provide a link for regular 
health check-ups, or in the aftermath of a serious 
accident, in which time is of the essence when it 
comes to securing emergency treatment.  
Territories such as Thailand and the Philippines 
spring to mind, as do sections of Scandinavia and 
Latin America, all of which contain coastal areas 
that remain relatively isolated from the mainland. 
However, the first fruit of Thailand-based 
Albatross Marine Design’s (AMD’s) AS14 class 
has actually made her debut in Russia. The AS14 
ambulance catamaran is intended for rescue and 
onboard paramedical treatment, and has been 
designed to balance stability and comfort with a 
top speed of 45knots when fully loaded. 
Constructed in 5083 aluminium alloy by 
Russian shipbuilder Aurora Ltd, and loosely 
based on AMD’s previous 12.3m R38 cat,  the 
AS14’s design is based on a ‘split hull’ catamaran 
shape, in order to both minimise tunnel wash and 
ensure a superior fit of the bow ramp, compared 
to conventional catamaran builds. A forward 
ramp has been positioned to assist with landing 
and casualty recovery on beachfronts, while the 
walk-through pilothouse contains four shock-
mitigating seats for the crew, alongside a steering 
station and kitchenette. 
A paramedical treatment compartment is 
situated aft of the pilothouse, while a wide aft 
deck, complete with docking station for mooring 
and rescue operations, complements the overall 
design.  The crew can count on four bunks, 
equipped with folding seats, toilet and storage 
space, situated within the hull, alongside the 
engine rooms. 
The AS14 features the capacity for two 
stretchers (including floating models), which can 
be loaded from both forward and aft doors, and 
which are secured with shock-mitigating 
pedestals when the casualty is on board. 
Meanwhile, a crane and side doors are intended 
to enable the crew to rescue casualties directly 
from the water, or from higher plains, the latter 
including large vessel decks and embankments. 
As well as the capability to negotiate shallow 
waters, AMD’s design sees the cat capable of 
operating in broken ice up to 50mm. Sea trials 
have also shown the vessel equipped for 
seaworthiness in conditions of up to sea state 5. 
For the best range possible, and perhaps 
surprising for a vessel of this size, the AS14 
carries two fuel oil tanks, each boasting a capacity 
of 1,750litres, while her propulsive arrangement 
comprises a pair of Seatec850Plus engines driving 
Castoldi 400HC waterjets. All in all, this versatile 
model provides an interesting blueprint for how 
catamarans can be modified to bridge the gap 
between hard-to-access locations and essential 
healthcare provision services.

T
he high-speed patrol craft sector is coming to rely 
increasingly on vessels that boast not only speed 
but equally high levels of endurance in the field. With 
this noted, the delivery of Atco Noura to ATCO in 
October 2014 represents an impressive step forward, 
with the 45m boat coming to command a range more 
commonly associated with larger naval vessels. 
The Atco Noura order also represents the first order 
received by UK designer Macduff Ship Design, and its 
long-standing Turkish shipbuilding partner Tor 
Marine, for a high-speed patrol boat. Built with a steel 
hull and aluminium superstructure, the vessel has been 
developed to withstand the rigours of high-speed 
interception and patrol duties, featuring a designed 
service life of 25 years. The vessel’s hull form was 
finalised after a round of tank testing and CFD analysis, 
conducted at Poland’s Centrum Techniki Okretowej 
(CTO). 
The area which Atco Noura is tasked with patrolling 
is also significant; the vessel will conduct security 
patrols around Khafji Joint Operations (KJO), the 
offshore oil fields operated by Saudi Aramco and 
Kuwait Oil Company, although she has the range and 
means to cover the complete exclusive economic zone 
(EEZ) of Kuwait and the Arabian Gulf, including 
locations situated up to 150 miles offshore. Her key 
duties will include surveillance of Kuwaiti offshore 
installations, providing offshore supply support to 
other patrol and speed boats in the region, and 
enabling a channel for communications between other 
offshore patrol vessels and the Kuwait Coastguard’s 
shore-based stations. 
The vessel’s endurance, in standby mode, has been 
designed to exceed two weeks, accommodating a 
maximum crew complement of 19 persons. This is 
partly enabled by a generous onboard fuel oil storage 
capacity of 27,700litres. Atco Noura’s below-main deck 
area has been subdivided into six watertight 
compartments, with accommodation both above and 
below the main deck, and the wheelhouse and 
observation house positioned to grant her crew 
maximum visibility. When the vessel requires high 
speed, a propulsive package comprising four CAT 
3516 engines driving Bruntons propellers through ZF 
gears grants Atco Noura a top speed of 32knots.

B
altika’s concept can be traced back to the early 
1990s, when Russia was vaunting the possibility 
of building a new oil export channel, linking the 
Timan-Pechora area, via pipeline, to the Russian 
port of Primorsk, in the eastern end of the Gulf of 
Finland. The plan was that tankers would then 
collect crude oil shipments from Primorsk and 
deliver these to commercial markets worldwide. It 
was obvious at the time, though, that the volume 
of increased oil transportation in the Baltic Sea 
would necessitate the availability of larger-sized 
tankers. In turn, this led to new requirements for 
icebreaking operations – with the existing 
icebreaker fleet, two icebreakers were typically 
required to create a wide enough channel for just 
one Aframax tanker.
To avoid the costs of deploying two icebreakers, 
and determined that one could be sufficient for 
the job, Aker Arctic (at that time, Kvaerner Masa 
Yards Arctic Research Centre ) began, in the mid-
1990s, to consider the idea of an oblique 
icebreaker. The idea was to create a single vessel 
that could alternate between two operational 
modes:  bow / stern ahead, or obliquely. This 
would enable the vessel to create both narrow and 
wide channels, according to the sizes of the 
tankers they were assisting. 
Drawing on Aker Arctic’s conceptual solutions, 
Baltika’s design came to incorporate a fully 
asymmetric  hull form. The icebreaker’s layout, 
including her tank arrangement, has also been 
made asymmetric. The propulsion system is 
based on three rudder propellers; two astern and 
one in the bow. 
The vessel is able to transit in ice thicknesses of 
up to 1m and can be utilised for both icebreaking 
and ice management functions, given her ability 
to move in any direction. The asymmetric hull 
form and oblique operation mode also provides a 
means for Baltika to engage in effective oil spill 
recovery tasks, thus bolstering her productivity. 
The vertical side of her hull can also be used as a 
sweep arm, across a range of sea states and 
weather conditions, and the vessel has a specially 
designed, built-in brush collector system for oil 
recovery missions. Her manoeuvrability and easy 
handling also make her suited to emergency and 
rescue functions. 
According to the Russian Maritime Register of 
Shipping (RS), which classed Baltika, the new 
concept vessel will provide a learning process for 
the captains, revealing, with time, further new 
possibilities for vessel usage. Experience gleaned 
from the design of the vessel for operations in the 
Baltic Sea will similarly be used to further develop 
the concept for Arctic use, RS adds.

D
eveloped to represent a new breed of dive 
support vessel (DSV), the Incat Crowther-
designed Bhagwan Dryden is an interesting take 
on this high-in-demand offshore vessel concept. 
The steel catamaran has been designed to 
undertake six key operational functions, namely: 
dive support; geophysical survey; geotechnical 
survey; cargo transport; hyberbaric rescue; and 
safety standby. The 56.8m x 16m vessel has also 
been designed for efficient operations in shallow 
waters, and comes fitted with a remotely operated 
vehicle (ROV), a pair of decompression chambers 
and two Pommec launch and recovery systems. 
Each diving system has a depth rating of 50m. 
Bhagwan Dryden’s aft deck area spans some 
250m² and has a capacity of 150tonnes, enabling 
her crew to carry a range of sophisticated survey 
equipment, as well as providing ample room for 
purpose-fitted deck equipment such as the launch 
and recovery systems, a stern roller and shark jaw, 
tow pins, an A-frame and waterfall winches. 
Accommodation for up to 44 persons is situated 
in the hull and the mid-deck, while the main deck 
hosts an ROV control room, three workshops and 
areas for the crew’s rest and recreation, including 
a cinema, a dining mess, lounges, cold food 
storage spaces and a changing room. Four fuel 
tanks, each boasting a capacity of 33,096litres, 
enable a range of 2,000nm at 100% MCR. 
The vessel’s propulsion package integrates a pair 
of Schottel STP 550 azimuthing stern drives, 
azimuthing bow thrusters and generators. She has 
also been equipped with four Cummins gen-sets, 
comprising two QSK38-Ms and two QSK 19-Ms, 
and a battery bank sufficient to power the DSV 
for short periods, thus enabling the vessel type to 
operate in and around designated emission 
control areas (ECAs) and other areas deemed 
environmentally sensitive. The generators were 
selected due to their ability to power up in stages, 
to minimise fuel burn. As a result, Incat Crowther 
claims, Bhagwan Dryden’s propulsive system 
enables her to achieve a speed of 7knots whilst 
drawing just 25% of boat power. 
The Schottel drives are linked to a Kongsberg 
control system, which grants the cat dynamic 
positioning 2 (DP2) capability, and this is 
enhanced by a Sondardyne Ranger 2 USBL 
acoustic positioning system, which allows the 
vessel to keep station relative to undersea 
reference points.

T
he construction and delivery of the twin 
vessels Bugsier 7 and Bugsier 8 represented not 
only the completion of an order, but German 
shipyard Fassmer’s first step into tug production. 
The tugs were delivered to the Bugsier Reederei 
fleet, and have been stationed in the port of 
Hamburg, having been designed to meet 
Germanischer Lloyd’s requirements for operations 
in seaports and coastal areas. 
Basing these newbuilds’ design loosely on 
previous Bugsier Reederei ship-handling tractors, 
Fassmer developed a new hullform and propulsion 
system for Bugsier 7 and her sister. Each vessel has 
been fitted with a pair of 360degs-rotatable Schottel 
propulsion units, both positioned under the forward 
section of the steel hull, approximately in line with 
the front of the wheelhouse. A protective plate, 
mounted on struts, has been fitted immediately 
forward of the propulsors, to safeguard these units 
when the vessels are operating in shallow waters.
Also, a skeg has been added to the aft hull, for 
enhanced directional stability. The vessels’ 
medium-speed ABC engines, manufactured in 
Belgium, grant Bugsier 7 an output of 
approximately 4,500kW and a bollard pull rating 
of approximately 72tonnes. The ship offers 
accommodation for up to six members of crew, 
although a more typical complement during 
operations will be three persons.

T
he 34.29m loa Burrard Otter II represents the 
second replacement SeaBus vessel in the fleet 
maintained by Translink subsidiary Coast Mountain 
Bus Company (CMBC), which provides more than 
96% of all water bus services in Canada’s Vancouver 
region. Originally, CMBC relied on two vessels, 
namely Burrard Beaver and Burrard Otter, both of 
which entered service in 1977; vessel age, by necessity, 
spurred the operator to seek replacements for this duo, 
and the first replacement vessel, the ABD-/Victoria 
Shipyards-built Burrard Pacific Breeze, made her debut 
in 2009. 
Rather than being viewed as a direct successor, it 
might be more accurate to describe the Damen-built 
Burrard Otter II as a ‘refinement’ of the Burrard Pacific 
Breeze design. Canadian design stable Robert Allan Ltd 
(RAL) was contracted to address and amend identified 
deficiencies in Burrard Pacific Breeze’s design and 
construction. Working in tandem with subcontractor 
Offshore Research Ltd, RAL performed a series of 
motions studies for Burrard Pacific Breeze, 
accompanied by model tests, to refine that vessel 
design’s hull motions. CFD analyses were all conducted, 
to determine the optimum configuration for the new 
design’s hulls. 
Additionally, RAL conducted interviews with those 
Translink staff – such as masters, engineers and crew 
– who had direct experience of working aboard 
Burrard Pacific Breeze. The feedback from these 
members of personnel was also incorporated into 
RAL’s considerations when it came to finalising 
Burrard Otter II’s design. 
As the first SeaBus type to be built to class society 
standards, Burrard Otter II is powered by four 300kW 
engines, each driving an azimuthing Z-drive thruster, 
located at the ends of both hulls. It is estimated that the 
vessel will produce 20% less carbon dioxide than either 
of the 1977-built SeaBus models.  The passenger space 
layout has been optimised to facilitate the vessel’s 
mission profile of loading/unloading a full complement 
of 395 passengers within a period of three minutes, a 
feat that is achievable thanks to the ferry’s multiple 
automatic doors on each side. 
The Burrard Pacific Breeze design also provided 
some influences for Burrard Otter II, most notably in 
the newbuild’s co-option of the former vessel’s bilge 
keel design, which was formatted to reduce the vessel’s 
pitching motions. The sightlines for the passenger 
space and bridge have also been revamped for 
maximum visibility.

I
ndia is currently experiencing an upswing in 
container port and terminal development, 
necessitating the availability of dedicated vessels 
capable of transferring containers and boxes from port 
to port. As a result, Groot Ship Design was contracted 
to work alongside the shipbuilding division of India’s 
Chowgule Group to produce a series of dedicated port 
feeders, each featuring the ability to carry 100teu 
containers, and capable of accessing the numerous 
local ports and rivers spanning the country’s coastline. 
The resulting first vessel in this series, Chowgule 7, 
was developed as an ‘open top’ container vessel, and 
she has subsequently attracted attention as one of the 
smallest open top vessels to be built to be date. The 
nature of this design necessitated the up-front 
positioning of the superstructure, so as to safeguard the 
container cargo holds from water ingress. After 
consultation with the local authorities, hatch covers 
were added to the vessel’s final particulars, for 
enhanced protection. 
One of the specifications requested by 
Chowgule was that the port feeder should be easy 
to operate and incorporate straightforward 
features, thus enabling local operators to take 
control of the vessel and have her ‘up and 
running’ with a minimum of complications. Two 
ZF deck-mounted rudder propellers were 
incorporated into her design, to facilitate 
manoeuvring and thereby obviating the need for 
a traditional, fully equipped engine room. 
Instead, Chowgule 7 relies on a small engine 
room, located in the fore, which houses a pair of 
generator sets. As Groot Ship Design puts it: 
“Manoeuvring the vessel does not require a bow 
thruster.” This set-up also eliminates the costs 
and maintenance issues associated with running 
conventional engine room ventilation systems. 
A dedicated container crane, manufactured by 
Liebherr, has been fitted onto a pedestal in the 
vessel’s mid-section, to simplify container 
loading, discharging and shifting operations. 
Chowgule 7 has also been equipped with an anti-
heeling system, including a Leeuwestein-
manufactured pump rated 3,000m³/hour.

A 
busy 2014 for CTruk saw the UK boatbuilder 
acquire a new 6,400m² premises, to be 
operated in tandem with its existing Brightlingsea 
yard, and roll out a rebrand of its existing range 
of vessels. The group has streamlined its previous 
vessel classes into three main categories; the first 
of which, the CTruk Multi Purpose Cat (MPC) 
family, now encompasses all offshore wind farm 
support catamarans, including the previously 
named CTruk EVOC series; the CTruk SWATH 
vessels comprise all offshore-going SWATHs, 
replacing the previously monikered CTruk 
CWhisper vessels; and the THOR vessels are now 
represented by the CTruk THOR11 and THOR18 
models. The idea has been to round up each 
vessel type’s numerical descriptor to the nearest 
whole, for a more accurate representation of its 
size; hence, the CTruk 20T MPC, featuring a 
length of 18.5m, becomes the CTruk MPC 19. 
As the first in CTruk’s MPC 22 class, CWind 
Sword, which was delivered in December, was 
built for CWind and its boat share partner Ventus, 
and has commenced operations at the EnBW 
Baltic 2 offshore wind farm, off the coast of 
Germany. Constructed from advanced FRP 
composite for reduced weight, the offshore 
technician transfer vessel features a 20tonne 
flexible payload capacity, the ability to carry up to 
24,000litres of fuel and 72m² of deck space. This 
vast fuel storage capability grants the catamaran a 
range of 1,700nm, enabling her to undertake 
technician transfer missions at some of the most 
far-flung offshore wind parks, and in a range of 
adverse weather conditions. 
Among CWind Sword’s notable features is the 
adoption of a protected controllable pitch 
propeller system, which, in tandem with the 
vessel’s Volvo D13 engines, is intended to grant 
the operator enhanced bollard pull and service 
speeds across a variety of weather conditions. As 
with the builder’s previous MPC vessels, she 
comes complete with the CTruk-patented 
moveable wheelhouse and modular deck pod 
system, enabling her to take on multiple 
operational roles, increasing her chances of 
additional day hire, and allowing the operator to 
transport bulky turbine farm equipment, transfer 
systems, cranes and rescue vehicles in lieu of a 
full 12-passenger complement.

O
fficially launched in June 2014, Eddy1 represents 
the debutante in the new Efficient, Double-ended 
and DYnamic (EDDY) 30-65 class, developed by 
architects Baldo Dielen and Walter van Gruijthuijsen, 
and realised by Dutch builder Holland Shipyards. 
The vessel has been specifically designed to limit 
fuel consumption and enhance manoeuvrability 
when conducting operations. As a step towards 
achieving this goal, Eddy1’s hull has been designed 
in a manner unusual for tugs; ripping up the old 
diktat that tugs should match a bulky fore to a 
shallow aft, Eddy1’s layout instead opts to position 
most of its volume amidships. The freeboard has 
been raised for optimised seaworthiness, both at the 
fore and aft of the vessel. Also, the keel has been 
designed to be deeper than is typical for a tug of this 
size, to simplify the docking process and to enhance 
escort performance. 
The tug has been fitted with a propulsive set-up 
comprising two Mitsubishi main engines, each 
delivering 1,610kW, and a pair of Schottel SRP3000 
PTI hybrid azimuthing thrusters, generating a 
combined 1,950kW. The vessel features two separate 
engine rooms, which have been designed for ease of 
access during maintenance routines. Each engine 
room also features a Scania DI 16 generator, rated 
568kWe. 
The balanced equipment layout, combined with 
the simple but efficient hull shape, has a dramatic 
impact on fuel consumption.  During her first 
months of operation, it soon became apparent that 
Eddy1 required less than half the fuel of those 
conventional tugs of similar power which perform 
the same operations.
The towing point is located on the foredeck, in 
between a forward and an aft thruster, both positioned 
on the centreline. This not only highly simplifies and 
improves manoeuvring but ensures that high line-pulls 
can be maintained over a broad speed range and 
oblique angles of over 90degs. 
The shape of the hull helps to provide additional lift 
and line pull when the vessel is towed at an angle, 
thereby reducing the amount of energy, and 
subsequent fuel burn, required from the thrusters. 
According to Holland Shipyards, the line can be 
moved around a span of 270degs without making 
contact with the tug’s superstructure. 
Kraaijeveld has provided Eddy1’s SafeWinch unit, a 
double-drum with a holding capacity of 175tonnes. 
Onboard tank capacity enables the tug to store more 
than 100m³ of fuel and 36m³ of fresh water, which 
grants Eddy1 a range of 30 days at a continuous 
cruising speed of 9knots. Protection is provided by a 
double 800mm cylinder fender at the bow and a 
500mm cylinder fender all around the vessel.

t’s not often that we feature South Korea-built 
vessels in Significant Small Ships, but the 
relatively small, 5,160gt Elida, measuring in at 
97.08m x 20m, proves a welcome exception. Built 
to withstand the rigours of the offshore sector, this 
platform supply vessel (PSV) has been equipped 
and designed to undertake operations including 
standby safety duties, oil recovery and transferring 
equipment (including cargo, pipes and cement) to 
offshore rigs, platforms and support vessels. Elida, 
classed by DNV, is also approved to carry up to 
800m³ of noxious liquid substances. 
The PSV’s cargo space has been arranged with six 
tanks dedicated to dry bulk cargo; three dedicated 
and four multipurpose tanks accommodating cargo 
fuel oil; and six circular tanks able to store liquid 
mud and brine. In addition, four circular tanks and 
one centre tank have been dedicated to the storage of 
polymer emulsion. A further two multipurpose 
tanks can hold special products and substances (such 
as methanol, for example) while 22 tanks store 
domestic fuel oil and 22 tanks are allocated to ballast 
and drilling water. A series of 13 tanks can be utilised 
for oil recovery operations.
Elida’s design incorporates a passive roll reduction 
system and her two tunnel thrusters and single 
swing-up azimuth thruster have been fitted in the 
vessel’s forward section, for enhanced 
manoeuvrability during service. The vessel complies 
with the Norwegian Maritime Directorate’s 
requirements for safety standby vessels authorised to 
rescue up to 250 survivors, and the Oil and Gas UK / 
Emergency Response and Rescue Vessels Association 
(ERRVA) guidelines for ‘Group B’ rescue vessels, 
approved to take on up to 300 survivors. Her oil 
recovery capabilities comply with UK Maritime and 
Coastguard Agency (MCA) guidelines and the terms 
of Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating 
Companies (NOFO 2009).

T
he first in a series of eight specialised push 
boats, built to the specifications of Robert 
Allan Ltd’s (RAL’s) new RApide 4500 class, HB 
Hydra was developed to combine the benefits of 
extreme shallow draught handling, reduced fuel 
consumption and significant bollard pull into 
one relatively small vessel. 
Each RApide 4500 will be tasked with 
manoeuvring convoys of 16 barges, carrying 
iron ore from Vale’s Corumba mine in south-
west Brazil, down waterways spanning a 
distance of 2,500km, to tidewater near Buenos 
Aires, Argentina. The push boats’ operator, 
Hidrovias do Brasil, intends to keep these barge 
convoys rolling 24/7, 11 months per year, with 
minimal downtime. 
In accordance with new Brazilian regulatory 
requirements, HB Hydra and her sisters have had 
to prove their ability to stop the entire convoy in 
less than 2.5 flotilla lengths when operating fully 
laden, and at full speed, running downstream. 
Subsequently, these stipulations necessitated 
extensive analysis and testing, in order for RAL to 
develop a hull form capable of meeting the 
pushing, braking and manoeuvring requirements. 
CFD analysis was also performed, to verify 
models related to fuel consumption and the crash 
stop requirements, and real scale tests completed 
in Brazilian waters, prior to the order being 
confirmed with Turkey’s Uzmar Shipbuilding. 
In order to reduce fuel costs, HB Hydra was 
fitted with a diesel-electric propulsion system. 
The vessel’s three Schottel SRP 1215 Z-drive units 
were fitted with nozzles, modified for shallow 
draught operation, while her three Schottel 
propellers have also been ice-strengthened, for 
additional protection when the push boats are 
operating in hardwood-infested waters. The 
RApide 4500 range will run on HFO, with the 
ability to operate on MDO if so required; each 
push boat has a total fuel capacity of 500m³ of 
HFO and 30m³ of MDO. 
Each RApide 4500 is outfitted for up to 18 
persons, spread across six single and six double 
cabins spanning two deckhouse levels. The 
wheelhouse was designed to provide unobstructed 
360degs views, enabling the operator to focus on 
both the barge convoy ahead and any barge 
connection work taking place on the raised 
forecastle deck.

O
rdered to ease passenger congestion on 
high-demand routes between Singapore and 
the Indonesian island of Batam, Horizon 9 is the 
first in a series of sister high-speed, monohull 
ferries to stem from a UK-Singapore collaboration 
between designer BMT Nigel Gee and builder 
Penguin Shipyard International. 
Designated the class handle of ‘Flex Ferry’, the 
vessels, ordered by operator Horizon Ferries, are 
each designed to accommodate a maximum of 
eight crew members and 238 passengers; 208 of 
the latter category located in the main deck 
seating area (which includes luggage storage 
facilities) and 30 in a VIP saloon, situated on the 
upper deck. 
Classed by Bureau Veritas and flagged by 
Singapore, the ferries also stand out by dint of 
meeting the requirements of the 2000 High Speed 
Craft Code – an unusual designation for 
monohull ferries of this size.
The debut vessel in this class, Horizon 9, was 
reportedly constructed to an “aggressive build 
schedule”; indeed, the first unit of the ferry’s 
overall structure was delivered just six weeks after 
the contract was agreed. 
Horizon 9 features a design draught of 1.4m and 
the capacity to carry up to 8,000litres of fuel oil 
(divided equally between two tanks), 1,500litres 
of fresh water and 1,500litres of black water. 
Three Caterpillar C32 ACERT engines, rated 
970kW apiece and each driving a fixed pitch 
propeller, will provide each vessel’s power, 
resulting in a service speed of 26.5knots. 
With safety in mind, BMT Nigel Gee and 
Penguin factored a spacious wheelhouse layout 
with enhanced visibility into the vessel’s design, 
as a safety buffer for when the vessels are 
navigating the Singapore Strait, a stretch bustling 
with other vessels. Other design considerations 
include a low-resistance hull for enhanced fuel 
efficiency and reduced onboard noise levels, 
compared to typical high-speed ferries, for 
increased crew and passenger comfort.

eveloped as the flagship for CSIRO, Australia’s 
leading scientific and research agency, the 
research vessel Investigator is intended to fulfil a range 
of multifunctional roles within the southern oceans. 
Her duties include, but are not restricted to: acoustic 
habitat mapping; acoustic surveys of marine species; 
the acquisition of geological samples of the ocean 
bottom at depths of up to 5,000m; the acquisition of 
benthic samples of the ocean bottom at depths of up to 
6,500m; and the acquisition of 20-30m core samples of 
the ocean bottom at depths of up to 7,000m. 
In addition, Investigator will be expected to handle 
tasks such as bottom trawling at depths of up to 
4,000m, conducting oceanographic sampling, 
launching an array of egg/larval/fish sampling systems 
and tracking and assessing marine birds and mammals. 
The hull line was designed so as to curb noise 
emissions, by limiting the amount of air drawn under 
the vessel during operations. To assist in the above 
missions, the vessel has also been fitted with a stern 
ramp to support fisheries research activities, as well as 
a 13m x 9m gondola (for additional minimum 
underwater noise, as opposed to a motor-driven RIB, 
for example), mounted approximately 1.2m below the 
hull, and two retractable drop keels. The drop keels will 
house the ship’s scientific sonar and transducer suites 
– all of which have been supplied by Kongsberg – and 
can be lowered to a depth of 4m below the hull. 
One of Investigator’s more notable features 
concerns her propulsion motors; according to 
RALion (the joint venture formed between 
Canada’s Robert Allan Ltd and Alion Science and 
Technology to design this vessel), the inclusion of 
dual L3/Indar, 2,600kW units represents the first 
time that AC motors of this size have been 
incorporated into a research vessel which was 
specifically developed to comply with class 
society DNV’s ‘Silent-R’ requirements for 
underwater noise radiation. 
Featuring onboard capacity for up to 60 
persons, the vessel can store up to 833m³ of fuel 
oil, a volume that, the designer and builder claim, 
is sufficient to grant the vessel a range of nearly 
11,000nm when operating at 12knots, amounting 
to a period of roughly 60 days.

A
mong the many new Macduff Ship Design vessel 
concepts realised in 2014 stands the group’s first-
in-class oil collection barge Jeddah 53, which was 
delivered, alongside her sister Jazan 8, to the Saudi 
Port Authority in January 2014. 
The pair of 46m loa oil collection barges was 
constructed by Tor Marine in Turkey, with which 
Macduff has collaborated extensively on the 
production of various tugs, pilot boats, oil recovery 
barges and high-speed craft since 2009. Tor Marine 
was also responsible for building the Macduff-designed 
patrol vessel Atco Noura (see page 8). 
Jeddah 53 and Jazan 8 are primarily tasked with 
pollution control and the recovery of leaked oil from 
port waters, as well as handling oil/water separation 
duties. To enable the latter task to be conducted across a 
wide weather window, both in port and off the coast, the 
vessels have been designed to withstand the effects of 
harsh weather and hard waves and to operate with equal 
efficiency in both stationary and dynamic conditions. 
In terms of design, Jeddah 53 matches a single chine 
to a raked soft nose stem, and deploys twin azimuthing 
units with a centre skeg. With optimal manoeuvrability 
being a must for harbour vessels, Macduff subsequently 
opted for a propulsive set-up comprising two 
Caterpillar C18 ACERT main engines driving Schottel 
SRP 200 ASD units to attain this goal. Each barge is 
also fitted with three Caterpillar C4.4 generator sets, 
rated 95kW apiece, which power the vessels’ electric 
pumps and tank cleaning / emptying systems. 
Jeddah 53 and her sister are each fitted with six 
double-skinned oil reception tanks, divided into two 
pre-processing tanks and four holding tanks. In total, 
this arrangement grants each vessel a waste oil 
holding capacity of 553m³. Each vessel’s spacious 
wheelhouse features a dedicated area for her pumping 
systems controls, while her four-man crew can rely 
on three cabins, a galley, a mess/lounge area and two 
washplaces. In total, Jeddah 53 can accommodate up 
to 10 persons, with corresponding life-saving 
equipment for a full complement.

T
he design goal for Shipyard de Hoop’s latest fast 
support intervention vessel (FSIV) type, Karina, 
the first in its FSIV2000 class, would appear to have 
been based equally on what the designer didn’t want 
as that which it did. Having analysed problems 
commonly affecting FSIVs, the group came up with 
a number of key conclusions. Although most FSIV 
designs are optimised for maximum speed at light 
load, at full load the efficiency was noted to drop 
significantly, with a subsequent lapse in speed. 
Similarly, because of this optimisation, performance 
in the 13-15knot range was observed to be poor. To 
be able to manoeuvre with such vessels at low speed 
and in DP mode would require multiple engine 
installation and a hefty investment in controllable 
pitch propellers, trolling gears and two-speed gears.
As light displacement vessels are naturally more 
sensitive, DP control can also be problematic for 
these vessel types. Also, FSIVs are prone to 
experiencing higher resistance in calm water, poor 
manoeuvrability and increased likelihood of an 
excessively wet deck, with exposed cargo. 
The design of Karina was subsequently intended 
to sidestep these problems. The 55.17m loa vessel 
was developed with a bulbous bow, very slender hull 
with very small entry angles and a stern designed for 
both maximum speed and good seakeeping, with 
slamming negated. With fuel savings in mind, the 
design also incorporates Van Oossanen’s hull vane, 
which is estimated to be able to attain an 11-15% 
reduction in power consumption, proportionate to 
the speed, as well as reduced pitch motions. 
De Hoop selected a hybrid propulsion system, 
meaning that when Karina is operating in low-
speed mode (up to 13knots) and on DP, the vessel 
switches to diesel-electric mode, with power 
supplied via shaft generator. When operating at high 
speed, two CAT 351C 6engines come into play, 
directly coupled through a gearbox to the shaft. The 
gearbox has a PTI for a 350kW E-motor to propel 
the vessel at low speed. No reversing gear has been 
fitted; astern propulsion is only possible in diesel-
electric mode. With this set-up, full RPM control of 
all propellers (including the bow thruster) is 
possible while, at low speed, only one engine is 
required, thus saving fuel and reducing the need for  
maintenance.
The propeller design is such that the vessel can 
reach 21.5knots with a 150tonne deck load, using 
3.4MW (70% MCR). The economic speed is 
13knots, on one engine, using 450kW.  The two 
large highly efficient fixed pitch propellers are 
responsible for rapid acceleration to full speed in 
only 60 seconds.  The switching between DE-DD is 
fully automatic. It is estimated that the combination 
of propulsion configuration and hull design could 
lead to a 40% decrease in fuel consumption, 
compared to conventional FSIVs. 
Karina’s main lounge has been outfitted with 100 
luxury seats, luggage storage space, toilets and a 
buffet. It is located further aft in order to reduce 
vertical accelerations as much as possible. Further 
comfort is accomplished by low noise levels, which 
were recorded as being no greater than 57dB(A) at 
full speed in sea trials. The spacious bridge gives 
360degs round view and operations can be 
conducted from a single desk, suitable for navigation 
and DP operations.
The FSIV2000 was developed for the combined 
transport of deck cargo and passengers to 
offshore oil fields. The vessel boasts a 200m² aft 
main deck, with the capacity for 200tonnes of 
cargo, and a 40m² foredeck, with fittings and 
lashing points for two 20ft containers. 
Based on customer demands, different versions 
based on the same hull can be realised, including 
patrol versions with bulletproof protection and 
more berths, or versions with higher deadweight 
and more below-deck tanker space.

S
pecially built for the Canaveral Pilots 
Association, Florida, at Metal Shark’s 
Louisiana shipyard, the 14.6m x 4m Metal Shark 
45' Pilot Boat (referred to by the aforementioned 
association as simply ‘Boat 3’) comprises a 
welded aluminium vessel which uses the weight 
of a single, bow-mounted 485kW diesel engine 
and an extremely sharp forward entry to slice 
levelly through waves, instead of riding over the 
top of the crests and then dropping into the 
troughs. With enhanced stability a prime 
consideration in her design, the boat was 
developed specifically for operations in heavy 
seas, including those common to Florida’s 
Atlantic coastline. 
The vessel’s sole engine enables a cruise speed of 
20knots and consumes approximately 91litres of 
fuel on an hourly basis. The shaft log is a sealed, 
oil-filled tube with needle bearings. A thrust 
bearing mounted between the engine girders takes 
the propulsion thrust of the propeller, while sealed 
bearings reduce the friction required to turn the 
shaft, resulting in greater speed with less energy 
drawn. Six vibration mounts have been fitted, to 
isolate the engine from the hull, to reduce overall 
cabin noise and vibration.
The boat’s hull has been subdivided into a 
number of watertight compartments. The cabin 
and pilothouse have been recessed into the hull; 
inside the pilothouse, the helm has been arranged 
for seated operation, enabling the operator to have 
both hands free for steering and throttle control. 
Meanwhile, for enhanced, 360degs visibility for the 
pilothouse, the vessel incorporates Metal Shark’s 
own ‘pillarless’, automotive-style glass, and the 
pilothouse has been incorporated into a raised 
position, with the cabin featuring a low aft top so 
as to not restrict the crew’s view. 
The recessed cockpit, on the aft end of the cabin, 
provides weather protection for the pilot, and 
features four large overboard scuppers for 
drainage. An aft steering station has also been 
created near the transom, enabling a single boat 
operator to manoeuvre the boat in the event of a 
man overboard (MOB) recovery effort. A 
wraparound, urethane-sheathed foam collar 
provides the vessel’s fendering protection.

elivered in May, Mikotahi has been developed 
primarily to function as a pilot boat, but also 
to manage personnel transfers between New 
Zealand’s Port Taranaki and the Pohokura gas 
platform, situated 4km offshore in water depth of 
approximately 35m. 
The aluminium craft utilises Camarc’s double 
chine hull form, which the designer credits with 
providing the vessel with an optimal level of 
stability. Given the extreme weather conditions 
that can typically be expected en route, and at Port 
Taranaki’s own request, the vessel has been 
developed with self-righting capabilities, meaning 
instant recovery in the event of a capsizal. 
Mikotahi’s wheelhouse has been resiliently 
mounted, to ensure low onboard noise levels 
during operation. The wheelhouse is fitted with 
large bonded windows, which provide maximum 
visibility for crew members during pilot and 
platform boarding activities, and can accommodate 
two crew members and up to seven pilots, with 
suspension seating provided throughout. 
With safety in mind, Mikotahi has also been 
fitted with a pilot safety car track system on deck. 
A secondary control system is located aft of the 
wheelhouse, while a hydraulically operated rescue 
cradle is situated at the transom, for fast man 
overboard (MOB) recovery tasks. Given the fact 
she will be engaged in frequent offshore duties, the 
boat has also been equipped with hydrocarbon gas 
sensors and a deluge fire system. 
A propulsive arrangement comprising twin 
Scania Di16 662kW engines, coupled to ZF 500 
gearboxes which drive Hamilton HM461 
waterjets, provides a high degree of 
manoeuvrability and gifts the boat the ability to 
achieve a sprint speed of 30knots. As an additional 
concession to crew safety and comfort, the 
walkway in the engine room, situated beneath the 
vessel’s superstructure, features a headroom of 
1.9m, for easy access (and reduced stooping) 
when engine maintenance is required.
Mikotahi incorporates Camarc’s in-house-built 
Popsure fender, which features designated 
boarding sections on the forward shoulder, for 
easy boarding / disembarkation when carrying out 
pilot duties. Additionally, a bow fender was 
commissioned specifically for this delivery, to 
provide safe transit for Pohokura-bound personnel 
between the vessel and the platform access ladder, 
as well as to provide obvious impact protection 
whatever the craft’s current mission may be.

eveloped to fulfil a wide range of security- 
and safety-related duties, including SAR, 
dive support, seaborne ambulance capabilities 
and border patrols, the compact, prototype 
version of Norsafe’s new customisable Munin 
S1200 concept features a sleek, attractive design 
that might belie her more ferocious expected 
duties; namely, to enter the fray and actively 
combat waterborne criminals. Subsequently, the 
vessel has been designed to withstand the toll of 
high sea states, treacherous weather conditions 
and extended periods away from base. 
The basic concept behind the Munin S1200 has 
been to provide a craft that can be customised to 
the client’s specifications, granting the buyer the 
opportunity to mix and match elements of the 
propulsion system, as well as to change the size of 
the hull and to construct the vessel on either an 
‘open boat’ basis or with a cabin included. One 
constant is the vessel type’s twin-stepped,deep-
vee hull, intended to provide optimal stability 
across a variety of wave conditions
To date, Norsafe has secured one firm order for 
the Munin S1200, which is being built for a client 
who wishes to remain anonymous. The industry 
was provided a glimpse of the vessel type’s 
capabilities in September 2014, however, when 
the Munin S1200 demonstration craft welcomed 
22 persons onboard in a series of trial runs, 
enabling them to inspect the vessel’s facilities 
and to observe her crew shooting onshore 
targets (supplied by a military range) from the 
coastal waters. 
This demonstration unit has been constructed 
with a length of 11.7m, a beam of 3.5m and a depth 
of 3.2m, and can accommodate up to 20 persons. 
When fully laden, carrying a range of operation-
specific equipment, the craft weighs approximately 
6.5tonnes. 
The prototype Munin S1200’s power is supplied 
by a pair of Iveco N67 FTP engines, rated 418kW 
apiece, and deploys Arneson surface drives with 
457mm, five-bladed propellers, which have been 
designed to reduce underwater drag; Arneson 
claims that, compared to submerged propellers, the 
surface drives can reduce drag by approximately 
50%. Combined, this arrangement gifts the Munin 
S1200 demo boat a top speed of approximately 
60knots when carrying three persons. 
In terms of range, sea trials have proven the 
Munin S1200 demo craft capable of remaining 
offshore for 300nm, courtesy of a combined fuel 
tank capacity of 1,100litres. The fuel tanks are 
located forward of the engines. For additional crew 
convenience, and to simplify the refuelling process, 
the fuel tanks can be topped up via a series of fittings 
on the cabin side. 
The demo craft is fitted with Kongsberg’s Sea 
Protector remote weapon station, developed for use 
by small patrol and military boats, which can be 
controlled from the bridge and offers asymmetric 
scope for attack and counter-fire. However, potential 
customers can specify alternative weapon systems, if 
needs be, when consulting with Norsafe at the 
design stage of a new order. 
While the Munin S1200 can dish it out, it can 
also take the knocks associated with intensive 
patrol work. The vessel’s bodywork comprises a 
mixture of composites, including multi-axial 
fibreglass, reinforced vinylester and Divinycell 
sandwich materials, and is bolstered structurally 
by longitudinal box stiffeners and transverse 
bulkheads. 
Extra protection from impacts is provided by 
Norsafe’s in-house-developed fender system, which 
seals a basic layer of tough polyethylene within a 
reinforced PVC double skin. This fender is secured 
by sail tracks located at gunwale and chine level, 
and, in addition to absorbing hard knocks, grants 
the vessel an additional degree of buoyancy.
At the customer’s behest, the Munin S1200 class 
can also be fitted with a bullet-resistant cover, to 
protect the cabin, tank and engine room. This 
system would provide Level 3+ ballistics protection 
(7.62 cal. NATO or AK47). 
Working in such environments and at such high 
speeds, craft capsizal is a constant risk. To address 
this, Norsafe has developed the Munin S1200 series 
to automatically kill the engine power and block the 
engine air intakes should the boat flip over. The 
gunwale and cabin sides also feature grab handles 
for crew safety in the event of a capsizal, and for 
added comfort and stability when the craft is in 
pursuit mode. Meanwhile, with whole body 
vibration an ongoing concern for high-speed craft 
operators, the vessel has been fitted with shock-
absorbing seats, manufactured by Ullman 
Dynamics, which include four-point safety belts. 
Overall, the Munin S1200 seeks to strike a balance 
between presenting a nightmare for drug traffickers 
and a stable, safe platform for the police and coast 
guard agencies tasked with her operations.

W
hile we regularly cover a wide range of fast 
crew boats in Ship & Boat International, the 
launch and delivery of the 70m loa Muslim 
Magomayev in September has to rank as one of 
the largest of these vessel types we have reported 
on to date, as well as representing shipbuilder 
Incat Tasmania’s first foray into the construction 
of vessels specifically dedicated to the offshore oil 
and gas segment. 
Named after a popular Azerbaijani singer who 
was dubbed the ‘Frank Sinatra’ of the Soviet 
states, Muslim Magomayev has been designed to 
transport up to 150 passengers, 14 members of 
crew and 130tonnes of deck cargo through 
significant wave heights of 3m and 40knot winds. 
Designed by Incat Crowther, the aluminium fast 
crew boat is currently being operated in the 
Caspian region by Caspian Marine Services.
The DP2-optimised vessel matches a 275m² 
cargo deck with a relatively narrow beam of 16m, 
the latter necessitated by the width of the Volga-
Don Canal, through which she had to pass on her 
handover voyage from Incat Tasmania’s Hobart 
yard to Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, the vessel’s hull 
was put together around a semi-SWATH concept, 
and she incorporates an active ride control set-up, 
to produce as smooth a transit as possible for the 
platform-bound passengers, and to curb excessive 
rolling and / or the likelihood of seasickness. 
Muslim Magomayev boasts a range of 400nm, 
which is made possible by her generous fuel oil 
capacity, being able to store up to 50,000litres at 
any one time, split equally between four tanks. 
The aft deck can store up to six 10ft containers 
and has additional space for the storage of Reflex 
Marine’s Frog brand of crane-operated, ship-to-
platform personnel solutions. 
The vessel’s forward half comprises a three-
deck superstructure, which serves as home to 
the wheelhouse and passenger accommodation 
areas. The first passenger lounge is located on 
the first tier, and features seating for 92 persons, 
each provided with meal trays built into the 
arm-rests and with an audio jack, enabling 
passengers to listen to music or watch TV 
programmes and movies. A pair of additional 
VIP lounges are situated forward of the lounge 
on both sides, each hosting six passenger seats 
and storage facilities. 
The crew accommodation area is situated on 
the second tier, as is a second passenger lounge, 
built with 48 passenger seats. The second tier 
deck is the area from which passengers will 
move on and off the platforms, and, to assist this 
task, the vessel features an Ampelmann walk-to-
work system. 
Meanwhile, the windows within the 
wheelhouse, situated on the third tier, have been 
designed to slope forwards, and come with 
windscreen wipers, to ensure optimal crew 
visibility. The DP control station, at the aft of the 
wheelhouse, offers a comprehensive view of the 
boat’s main aft deck and sides. 
For ease of maintenance, each of the vessel’s 
MTU main engines and Caterpillar 550kWe 
generators can be accessed by a removable deck 
hatch. The Cat generators provide the power for 
all onboard domestic requirements, as well as the 
Thrustmaster-manufactured bow thrusters.

18.8m Arie Visser class, which made its debut in 
1999 and is now gradually being phased out, the 
NH 1816 class was developed to rectify some of 
the Arie Visser’s weaker points, especially those 
related to exhaust emissions control, noise and 
vibration and onboard comfort. 
Intended as the first of 10 NH 1816 craft for the 
KNRM, the debutant, NH 1816, is the result of a 
collaborative design and construction process 
overseen by Damen Shipyards, the Technical 
University of Delft (TU-Delft) and naval architect 
De Vries Lentsch. Larger than her KNRM 
predecessors, NH 1816 features  increased 
capacity for survivors, more efficient fuel 
consumption and emissions control and enhanced 
ergonomics, making her worthy of safe sea rescue 
operations in the 2010s – and particularly since 
the ratification of the updated ILO Maritime 
Labour Convention.
As with the Arie Visser series, the NH 1816 class 
has been fashioned from marine grade aluminium 
and retains a number of the former vessel type’s 
features: for instance, the deployment of waterjets; 
the provision of slanted front windows in the 
wheelhouse, to enhance aerodynamics in high 
seas; Ullman jockey-type seats, to protect crew 
members’ backs and knees in rough weather; and 
a similar top speed, over the 30knot mark. NH 
1816’s fendering arrangement has been slightly 
revamped, resulting in a D-shaped and tapered 
solution, packed with solid foam, to offer 
protection when drawing alongside boats whilst 
conserving as much deck space as possible. As a 
result, NH 1816 can accommodate up to 120 
survivors externally, with another 25 located 
inside the lifeboat. 
Curbing G-forces was a prime consideration for 
the NH 1816 class. After initial discussions, the 
design team rejected Lex Keuning’s now-famous 
axe bow design due to the fact that the lifeboat 
would be conducting some of its search and 
rescue missions in shallow waters. Instead, NH 
1816 was built with a ‘semi-axe bow’ design, with 
the lowest part of the bow being higher than the 
lifeboat’s maximum draught, and the buoyancy 
compensation being included in the upper part of 
the bow. Tank tests conducted at TU-Delft and 
MARIN demonstrated a 40% reduction in vertical 
and horizontal G-forces, compared to the Arie 
Visser class. 
NH 1816's composite-built wheelhouse has 
been separately mounted, so as to minimise noise 
and vibrations for the six-man crew, as well as 
enabling better temperature insulation. In doing 
so, noise in the wheelhouse has been limited to 
75dB. This lightweight arrangement is also 
expected to slash fuel consumption rates.  
The NH 1816 is powered by two MTU 
8V2000M84L engines, each rated 1,790kW at 
2,450rpm, driving a pair of Hamilton 571 
waterjets, featuring unclutchable impellors, 
through ZF2000 gearboxes. The vessel has also 
been fitted with rear end retractable fins, which, 
in combination with the waterjet arrangement, 
grant the vessel superior manoeuvrability and 
directional stability to her KNRM predecessors. 
In trials, with the fins deployed, the coxswain 
was able to lower or raise the fins within just 
four seconds. 
This propulsive set-up grants the NH 1816 a top 
speed of 31knots (just 4knots less than that of the 
Arie Visser) and a bollard pull of 7tonnes, but 
range remains identical to its predecessor; 
approximately 380nm when operating at full 
speed, or 12 hours at 25knots. The engines have 
been equipped to continue functioning for 30 
seconds in a full capsize, in accordance with 
KNRM guidelines. 
A fully integrated IT and communications suite 
has been placed in the wheelhouse and spread 
over five 21” monitors. Monikered the Integrated 
Platform Management System (IPMS), crew can 
use each screen to access information including: 
ship system signals and alarms, including those 
related to the engines and fuel tanks; navigation 
readings, courtesy of GEMRAD radars, Furuno 
AIS and a Servowatch/Furuno chart plotter; 
communications, including WiFi, VHF and 
Iridium / Inmarsat satcomms solutions, amongst 
others; and onboard CCTV. Infra-red cameras 
can also be installed and incorporated into the 
system if deemed necessary. 
And, while it is hoped that the vessel and her 
forthcoming sisters will make history on the 
water, NH 1816 has already notched up a 
historical first, in becoming the first lifeboat to 
have been classified by Lloyd’s Register.

P
acific Leader is the debut entry in a series of L 
class vessels ordered by Swire Pacific Offshore 
Operations, and built by Japan Marine United 
Corporation to the specifications of Offshore 
Ship Designers’ (OSD’s) IMT997 platform supply 
vessel (PSV) template. 
The concept for this vessel type is one of 
reduced fuel consumption. The 97.29m PSV 
design incorporates fuel-efficient pods, a four-
engine diesel-electric power plant, significant 
cargo-carrying capacity and a bulk cargo system. 
A bulbous bow design was selected to handle a 
wide range of operating speeds, draughts and sea 
states, making Pacific Leader suitable for 
deepwater operations. Also, the hull was 
designed, OSD says, to have a 7.5-year window 
between class-required mandatory dockings. 
The main deck has a clear deck space of 912m², 
enabling it to accommodate four lengths of drill 
pipe/casing with safe access for the deck crew 
between joints. The Cargomaxx bulk system 
permits the transportation of dry and wet bulk 
cargoes in five separate tanks, deploying a 
pressure vacuum system to load/unload cargo. 
Pacific Leader also meets the requirements of the 
IBC Code and, subsequently, she can carry up to 
1,800m³ of noxious liquid substance (NLS) in 10 
dedicated tanks, arranged in pairs with 
re-circulation systems.
The vessel tank layout has also been arranged to 
make provisions for future upgrade to carry low 
flash liquids to DNV LFL class notation, in a 
capacity of approximately 180m³. 
The vessel also features a firefighting pump, 
driven by variable speed electric motor, and 
comes equipped with three 965kW variable 
speed, controllable pitch tunnel thrusters and 
SOLAS lifeboats.

T
he first in South Boats Isle of Wight’s (South 
Boats IOW’s) new South Cat 26m class of 
aluminium offshore wind farm crew transfer 
vessels, Seacat Intrepid has been designed with a 
brand new hull form, intended to provide the best 
performance possible across a range of sea 
conditions and operational requirements. The cat 
has been delivered to UK operator Seacat Services 
Ltd, a long-term South Boats IOW customer, which 
will also take delivery of the second South Cat 26m, 
Seacat Courageous, in early 2015. A third sister 
vessel, for an as yet undisclosed operator, is 
currently being built at South Boats IOW’s facility. 
Seacat Intrepid features a 9.2m beam, draws 1.45m 
and features an operational displacement of 
approximately 80tonnes. Designed to carry up to 12 
turbine technician passengers and three members of 
crew, the vessel has received DNV’s 1A1 HSLC R1 
Windfarm Service 1 and the UK MCA’s Cat 1 
notations, the latter permitting operations up to 
150nm from the nearest safe haven. 
According to South Boats IOW, the new hull 
form of the South Cat 26m class is the result of a 
round of “extensive testing” regarding the benefits 
and limitations of various hull forms when 
engaged in offshore wind farm support duties. 
This testing was conducted in order to strike a 
balance between achieving optimal performance 
in high sea states, guaranteeing crew and passenger 
comfort, attaining maximum fuel efficiency and 
enabling transfers to be conducted in higher sea 
states at the more remote deepwater arrays – four 
considerations that, the builder believes, 
conventional support vessel hull forms have never 
been able to equally satisfy, without experiencing 
limitations in some departments. 
The South Cat 26m class has subsequently been 
developed with a higher bow and deeper hull, while 
the technician saloon features a reduced height. 
Initial sea trials have seen improved turbine access 
performance and lower fuel burn rates, while ride 
comfort was notably increased in heavier sea states, 
the builder noted.  
The vessel is fitted with two MTU 12V2000 M72 
engines, driving Rolls-Royce 56A3 waterjets, 
resulting in a service speed of 26knots, increasing to 
29knots max. An Onan 19.5kW generator and 6kW 
back-up generator provide the vessel’s onboard 
power needs. Capacities include 20,000litres of fuel, 
1,500litres of fresh water and 1,500litres of waste 
water, and the boat has been built with container 
mounts fore and aft.

T
he delivery of the debut catamaran in 
Supacat’s SMV 24 series, resulting from a 
collaboration between Australian and UK 
designers Incat Crowther and Supacat, was a 
timely one, given the upsurge of activity in the 
offshore wind farm support sector. Both parties 
have brought something individual to the table; 
Incat Crowther specialising in fast aluminium 
craft, and Supacat hailing from a background of 
military and small naval solutions. 
Designed to transfer crew members to a variety of 
wind farm parks, including deepwater Round 3 UK 
turbine arrays situated 150nm from shore, the 
aluminium cat SMV 1 is exemplary of the growing 
trend for offshore wind farm crew transfer vessels 
which have been purpose-built to class rules, yet are 
able to fulfil a wider remit of tasks – including survey 
work, dive support, ROV support and stores transfer 
– in order to guarantee owners a wide charter window. 
One of the features enabling this multipurpose 
functionality is the deck system, which includes a 
through-deck and an integrated rail system running 
the length of the cat, thus enabling various items of 
equipment to be installed wherever required, 
alongside the vessel’s centreline – including ISO 
containers, deck cranes and diving rigs – depending 
on the vessel’s current mission. The deck area spans 
154m² and is strengthened to 2.75tonnes per m². A 
series of flush 2tonne tie-downs and removable 
16tonne tie-downs has been fitted, for the carriage of 
various cargo types. SMV 1’s deck also provides 19m 
of stowage fore to aft, enabling the vessel to transport 
up to 50ft of ISO containers, in a variety of 20ft and 
10ft sizes. Quick release couplings have also been 
installed to facilitate connection of accommodation 
modules to the cat’s potable water and sullage 
systems, and options exist for the installation of 
dynamic positioning systems and/or ‘walk-to-work’-
styled transfer systems.
The vessel has been designed to carry up to 12 
passengers and 30tonnes of cargo simultaneously, 
and can achieve a top speed of 30knots when carrying 
passengers and crew alone. Sea trials have proven 
SMV 1 capable of operating safely in significant wave 
heights of up to 3m.  The saloon comprises a fully 
equipped galley area with a settee, 12 reclining 
suspension seats (with seat belts) and accompanying 
laptop tables, two TVs and full air-con. The cat also 
boasts a range of 790nm (or 675nm when fully 
laden), made possible by four fuel tanks, each holding 
3,000litres. The vessel has also been constructed with 
a double bottom, for enhanced protection against 
bottom raking damage.

S
ince 1988, The Maritime Aquarium has been 
arranging school and public research voyages in 
Long Island Sound, the stretch of water spanning 
New York to Connecticut on the US north-west 
coast. Until 2014, the organisation had relied on a 
12.2m loa, 1980-built, diesel-powered trawler, 
Oceanic, to fulfil this role. However, given Long 
Island Sound’s environmentally sensitive status, it 
was decided to phase out this vessel and replace it 
with the larger, albeit ‘greener’, Spirit of the Sound – a 
move which has seen the new ship dubbed “the first 
hybrid research vessel ever in the US”. 
And Spirit of the Sound’s green credentials have 
been established from the outset. The aluminium 
catamaran’s motors are powered by lithium 
batteries, an arrangement reported to offer a 75% 
reduction in fuel consumption, compared to the 
previous vessel. This set-up will also enable her to 
run silently in Long Island Sound’s waters, thus 
eliminating underwater noise radiation. 
As well as offering a floating classroom facility 
for students, particularly those at the local 
Norwalk High School, enabling them to study 
and research marine life and geological features 
in the area, the vessel will conduct public study 
voyages (such as seal-spotting cruises, for 
example). 
Her propulsive arrangement demonstrates how 
far battery power has come in the past five years; 
the vessel will be able to undertake 2.5-hour 
cruises in silent mode, and has a recorded 
minimum range of 100nm. It is estimated that the 
batteries can typically be charged in less than 25 
minutes, echoing the experience of many hybrid 
lithium electric motor-based ferry operators in 
northern Europe. 
Spirit of the Sound’s indoor classroom space is 
fitted with HVAC, while the outside research area 
features a 600litre-capacity touch tank, to 
temporarily store netted wildlife and simulate a 
realistic marine habitat – and, hopefully, to 
stimulate the learning process. The research cat’s 
interior is also equipped with wi-fi capability, 
enabling data to be sent back to The Maritime 
Aquarium’s shore-based HQ. Her increased size 
also enables her to accommodate a larger number 
of onboard guests; up to 65, compared to 
Oceanic’s passenger complement of approximately 
29 persons. Hopefully, as well as enhancing both 
student and public awareness of marine 
ecosystems, the vessel will go on to inspire further 
experimentation in the incorporation of battery 
power into small boat and craft operations.

elivered to UK wind farm support vessel 
operator Windwave Workboats in June 
2014, the 19.7m loa Susie S is the first in 
Netherlands-headquartered builder Damen’s 
new Fast Crew Supplier (FCS) 2008 series of 
crew transfer craft. 
The aluminium FCS 2008 is based on Damen’s 
previous FCS 2610 model, albeit representing a 
smaller vessel overall, with length reduced by 
approximately 5m and beam by 2m. Despite the 
increased demand for larger offshore wind 
farm support vessels, primarily when it comes 
to transferring personnel at deepwater sites, 
there are still a number of offshore wind parks 
where both vessel length and bow height are 
restricted, and the FCS 2008 is intended to 
service these arrays. 
Like the FCS 2610, the FCS 2008 incorporates 
Damen’s Twin Axe hull design, features of which 
include decreased resistance and superior 
motion behaviour. Damen estimates that the 
optimised nature of the Twin Axe can reduce 
overall vessel fuel consumption (as well as 
subsequent emissions) by approximately 20%. 
Fitted with twin MTU diesel engines and 
Reintjes ZWVS 440/1 two-speed gearboxes, 
Susie S utilises a conventional fixed propeller 
drive for her propulsive needs. This 
configuration grants the vessel a service speed 
of 23knots, increasing to a sprint speed of 
26knots, and 10tonnes of bollard push when 
pushing onto wind farm turbines. Susie S is also 
fitted with a pair of Caterpillar C2.2T 22.5kW 
generators for redundancy. 
Although the FCS 2008 may be a more 
compact unit than the FCS 2610, Damen has 
optimised the boat’s dimensions; for instance, 
excluding her fendering, Susie S' waterline 
length is the same as her length overall. In 
terms of capacities, the vessel can store 
13,000litres of fuel and up to 8tonnes of deck 
cargo; the latter spread across a 35m² fore deck 
(which also includes safety rails, a 700kg 
hydraulic winch and a Heila HLM 5-2S crane) 
and a 25m² aft deck. She can carry over 12 
pallets on her forward cargo deck, and has a 
further, step-free, foredeck which Windwave 
Workboats describes as being ideal for loading 
from TP davit winches or vessels with limited 
reach crane booms, such as hotel vessels. 
Facilities for the technician passengers 
include: two toilet and shower rooms; 12 
adjustable and gas-sprung Norsap 800 seats; 
and access to wi-fi, TV and a DVD/CD player, 
as well as a toaster and microwave oven. 
Following North Sea trials, Windwave 
Workboats reported that Susie S was able to 
contend with 2m waves and Force 5-6 winds, 
whilst experiencing little to nothing in the way 
of slamming. The vessel has just completed her 
first project, providing 24/7 support for VBMS’s 
cable-laying activities at the Butendiek wind 
farm, off the coast of Germany, a period in 
which she was recorded to enjoy a rate of 100% 
availability over the course of three months.

ustralia-headquartered Strategic Marine may 
be more renowned for its specialism in the 
high-speed vessel sector, with ‘typical’ products 
including offshore wind farm support craft, patrol 
boats and rescue vessels, but the Thaiyak project, 
undertaken alongside Fremantle-based McAlpine 
Marine Design (MMD), represents a new foray into 
the creation of on-station vessels. 
Intended to function as a mobile ‘floating police 
station’, the 40m loa Thaiyak (which translates as 
‘arrow’ in the vernacular of Torres Straits islanders) 
was developed to be moored for lengthy periods (of 
up to 120 days) at Ashmore Reef, an external 
territory of Australia situated in the Indian Ocean, 
450-500nm from Darwin. 
She replaces the 34.9m loa Ashmore Guardian, 
which was originally built by Australia’s K Shipyard 
and delivered to the Australian Customs and Border 
Protection Service (ACBPS) in 2007. Thaiyak was 
contracted by Gardline Australia, which serves as 
the prime contractor to the Australian Government, 
and represents the first ACBPS vessel to be built for 
commercial use outside of Australia. 
As part of the design and construction process, the 
vessel was required to meet the stipulations of the 
Australian Standard for Defence Contracting 
(AUSDEFCON), reflecting best practice and value 
for money. The basic concept is that of a police 
station situated offshore, complete with holding 
facilities, featuring an extended service life of 15 
years and capable of operating while creating as 
small an environmental impact as possible. This is 
particularly the case given that the 583km² Ashmore 
Reef has been classed as an Australian 
Commonwealth marine reserve, a designation 
awarded to environmentally sensitive habitats. 
The design also had to factor in operational 
restrictions in the waters surrounding the 
Ashmore Reef, when determining the vessel’s 
length and draught.
Constructed at Strategic’s Vung Tau yard in 
Vietnam, and wedding a steel hull to an 
aluminium superstructure, for optimal strength 
and stability when making the long ocean 
crossing between the Ashmore Reef and the 
Australian mainland, Thaiyak has the ability to 
accommodate 17 members of crew, and 25 
passengers/ detainees. In addition to waterborne 
criminals (such as drug traffickers), the bulk of 
these detainees will comprise illegal immigrants 
(or ‘irregular arrivals’, as the Australian 
Government tactfully puts it) who will remain 
aboard the vessel until craft are dispatched to take 
them onshore. 
This arrangement is not solely a punitive one; 
many ‘irregular arrivals’ utilise flimsy, 
un-seaworthy craft in their attempts to enter the 
country, many of which fall apart or are destroyed 
during their hazardous journeys. Thaiyak 
therefore doubles up as a hub for the deployment 
of search and rescue and casualty recovery 
services. The vessel comes equipped with two 
high-speed Norsafe Magnum 750 tenders, each 
measuring 7.5m in length. These are both stowed 
on the stern and incorporate Norsafe NDA-40 
davits with a SWL of 4tonnes and a top lifting 
speed of 18m per minute, enabling crew to swiftly 
take to the water for rescue, surveillance and 
inspection work.

ay 2014 saw design studio Guido de Groot 
kick off its new Continental III superyacht 
series with the delivery of the 27.2m x 6m 
motoryacht The Next Episode to an unspecified 
client. Guido de Groot was responsible for the 
motoryacht’s exterior and interior design, while 
the Van der Valk shipyard oversaw her 
construction, making the vessel a truly home-
grown Dutch affair.
The Next Episode was constructed with a 
lightweight aluminium semi-displacement hull, 
and she deploys Volvo Penta IPS drive 
technology, for enhanced steering behaviour 
and to facilitate manoeuvrability. Noise levels 
are kept to a minimum courtesy of the vessel’s 
underwater exhausts and shaft alignment 
elimination. 
The vessel’s main deck area accommodates 
both the saloon and dining area, together with a 
closable galley. The saloon and dining area are 
separated from the owner’s residence by half-
raised pilothouse, while the main stairway 
grants access to the lower accommodation deck, 
home to four guest cabins, complete with 
individual bathroom facilities. The front part of 
this deck was especially designed to house the 
yacht’s three-man crew, spread across two cabins 
with three fixed berths, and featuring a crew 
mess with laundry and kitchen facilities. 
An enlarged flybridge deck offers an outside 
helm position, alongside a wet bar on the vessel’s 
port side and opposite a sizeable, L-shaped sofa 
which serves as both a lounge and outside dining 
area. The rear section of the flybridge stores two 
wave runners and one jet-ski. 
What’s more, the inclusion of a 52kW Fohhn 
Audio sound system means that The Next 
Episode’s saloon and flybridge area can be 
transformed into a nightclub-style environment 
for guests.

esigned for operations in shallow and 
medium waters, the survey boat Thea, built 
to the specifications of Alnmarintec’s Wavetrain 
800 catamaran class, has been delivered to, and 
installed aboard her mother ship, the 54m x 12m 
survey vessel Fugro Proteus, the latter of which 
was built by Damen and delivered to Fugro in 
early 2014, her zone of operation being the Gulf 
region. Thea was developed specifically to reach 
the areas that Fugro Proteus cannot, including 
littoral waters and coastal spots where medium-
sized vessel manoeuvrability is restricted. 
Measuring just below 9m in length, Thea has 
been designed to pack in an abundance of features 
not typical of boats of this size. For instance, she 
has been furnished with a moon pool, an electric/
hydraulic crane and a survey station, the latter 
outfitted with eight 19” screens, a full-height 19” 
rack and a half-height 19” rack for housing data 
storage and processing equipment. Powered by a 
pair of Steyr MO144M38 engines driving 
Alamarin 245 waterjets, Thea can achieve a speed 
of 15knots in lightweight mode. A 7kW Cummins 
Onan generator provides 240v for the boat’s 
survey equipment, air-con and 240v sockets. 
Thea is launched and recovered from and to 
Fugro Proteus by means of a Henriksen painter 
hook and a stern ramp deployment system. With 
respect to her activities in shallow waters and 
confined spaces, she has also been fitted with 
radar, depth sounder, VHF and GPS capabilities, 
enabling her to be self-sufficient while she is on 
duty away from her mother ship. Also, given the 
heat common in the Gulf region, Thea has been 
fitted with a retractable canopy manufactured by 
SureShade, intended to provide some respite from 
the sun’s glare for those working on the aft deck. 
Maximisation of onboard space was another 
important consideration for Alnmaritec. Given 
Thea’s limited deck space, it was vital to keep all 
of the cables related to survey equipment clear of 
the deck. Subsequently, Alnmarintec designed a 
custom cable exit from the 19” rack, alongside a 
recess in the bulwarks for the cable tray to be 
installed, in order to keep the cable safe whilst 
retaining its accessibility to the crew. 
A stern tow post has been installed, enabling 
Thea to tow an EdgeTech 512i towfish sonograph. 
A Simrad EA400 hydrographic echo sounder has 
also been incorporated into the boat’s hull.

altic Workboats’ August-delivered aluminium, 
multipurpose pilot boat, Zeeaster, follows a 
growing trend for low-freeboard and low-draught 
vessels, enabling such craft to safely and 
efficiently navigate and perform their duties in 
shallow waters. 
The 14.7m x 4.3m vessel was ordered by 
Belgian coastal assistance service provider DAB 
Vloot, specifically to undertake pilotage and 
customs inspection tasks in and around the Port 
of Antwerp, including the boarding of small 
craft and river vessels.  Featuring a maximum 
draught of 1.29m, Zeeaster’s hull design was 
developed specifically to result in enhanced 
manoeuvrability, increased fuel efficiency and 
minimised wave generation, across a range of 
operating conditions. 
This strategy would appear to have paid off; in 
pre-delivery sea trials, conducted in tempestuous 
Baltic Sea conditions, the vessel displayed 
particularly low vertical acceleration values, 
despite having to plough through 3m-high 
waves, Baltic Workboats claims. 
The vessel has also been designed to provide 
enhanced levels of comfort to onboard 
personnel, including up to three members of 
crew and four pilots or customs inspectors. The 
wheelhouse is fitted with shock mitigation seats, 
and was designed to be flexibly mounted, to cut 
noise levels. As a result of the latter detail, 
wheelhouse noise levels have been measured at 
62dB when Zeeaster is operating at a top speed 
of 22knots – far below the 75dB threshold 
originally specified by DAB Vloot during the 
vessel’s contract negotiations. 
On a related personnel safety note, a deck and 
railing heating system has also been fitted onto 
the vessel; as well as encountering stormy 
weather in the Baltic Sea, crew members can 
expect sub-zero temperatures and piercing 
winds when operating in this territory 
throughout the winter months.  
Zeeaster’s design similarly takes endurance into 
account. An onboard fuel capacity of 1,500litres, 
in tandem with her propulsive set-up, grants the 
pilot boat a range of more than 260nm when 
operating at a cruising speed of 16knots, sea trials 
have revealed.
