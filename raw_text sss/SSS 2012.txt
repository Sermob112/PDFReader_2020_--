T
he concept that sailing should be ‘for all’ is alive 
and well, with growing moves within the 
market to cater for disabled and/or elderly and frail 
passengers and would-be sailors alike. In the UK, 
projects such as Wetwheels, the enterprise of Geoff 
Holt, the first disabled person to sail single-
handedly around Great Britain, are offering 
wheelchair-bound seagoers the chance to embark on 
fishing trips care of a modified vessel supplied by 
boatbuilder Cheetah Marine, while the Jubilee 
Sailing Trust, hoping to build on the focus placed 
on the London 2012 Paralympics, is currently 
overseeing a two-year global trip aboard the 55m 
tall ship Lord Nelson, the first of its kind to be 
crewed by a combination of able-bodied and 
disabled seafarers. 
Similarly, July 2012 saw the launch and delivery of 
the 11m Alison MacGregor, which Blyth Workcats 
designed and constructed on behalf of UK charity 
Solent Dolphin. The vessel was constructed purely 
to allow Solent Dolphin to take people with 
disabilities, including those in wheelchairs, on free 
sails in the waters surrounding Southampton, 
between the months of May and September. As Dr 
Charles Fay, general secretary of Solent Dolphin, put 
it in 2012: “We go out in most weathers because our 
guests are always so keen to be afloat. Blind people, 
for example, derive tremendous pleasure from the 
feeling of wind and rain on their faces, and it is a 
salutary reminder of our good fortune for those of us 
for whom boating is a routine experience.” 
Crewed by volunteer, albeit qualified sailors, Alison 
MacGregor, which has been named after a young 
woman killed in the 1988 Clapham rail disaster, has 
had its wheelhouse positioned further forward than 
the cat manufacturer’s usual range of vessels, to 
enable space for a total of 17 seats within the aft deck 
area. Some of these seats are flip-up models, allowing 
greater space for wheelchairs upon this deck, and this 
entire area is covered by a canopy. Moulded wind 
breaks were also factored into the aft deck layout, to 
protect passengers from harsh and wet weather. 
The deck area also features protective side panels 
and wheelchair ‘clamp down’ points, for passenger 
safety, and a wide sliding window has been built 
into the wheelhouse to enable refreshments to be 
served directly into the deck area, removing the 
need to carry trays of drinks, and so on, around the 
side of the bridge. The onboard toilet is also larger 
than standard, and the stern doors have been 
widened, to enable wheelchair-bound passengers to 
board the vessel from the pontoon, via ramp.

T
he genesis of  Bergesen D.Y would appear to be 
the outcome of combining the properties from 
Swede Ship Marine’s previous lightweight deliveries,  
Uni Kragerö (see Significant Small Ships of 2011, 
pp64-66) and Sjömann, tinkered to fit the additional 
functional requirements put forward by the 
Norwegian Sea Rescue Society, Redningsselskapet, 
which operates a large number of boats and vessels 
along the Norwegian coastline, from more than 60 
different harbours. 
As a result, Bergesen D.Y has been designed to assist 
with towing, firefighting, medical transportation, 
on-scene coordination, diving operations and other 
search and rescue (SAR) missions. Since Bergesen D.Y 
is operating in highly populated coastal areas with 
large volumes of commercial and leisure shipping 
traffic, particular attention was made to minimise the 
vessel’s impact on the environment. One example is 
the requirement for low wake wash, in order to 
achieve a degree of energy efficiency suited to a vessel 
of this size and speed.  Another key factor in this 
regard is the vessel’s lightweight design;  Bergesen D.Y 
is a weight-optimised carbon-fibre sandwich 
construction,  scantled according to DNV HSLC –
R2 Patrol with 6.5g vertical acceleration. Further, the 
vessel has undergone local hull reinforcement, to 
meet the owner’s requirement for rough handling in 
extreme weather conditions and worst-case scenarios 
during SAR missions, such as beaching and 
emergency towing. In addition to thermal insulation, 
the sandwich construction provides a good degree of 
inherent floatability, and, together with the fender, it 
contributes to more than half of the vessel’s 
displacement. 
The wheelhouse is flexibly mounted to the hull to 
achieve a low-noise working environment. Four fully 
damped crew seats are installed in the wheelhouse, 
which also contains room for four belted passengers 
or one person on a stretcher. Below deck, there is 
space for up to seven seated passengers.   
Bergesen D.Y has twin drivelines with azimuthing 
thrusters, for enhanced manoeuvrability combined 
with the thrust properties of the twin contra-rotating 
propellers. The installed power of 375 kW doubled 
gives Bergesen D.Y a cruising speed of 36knots at less 
than 200litres per hour. Meanwhile, top speed has 
been recorded at 38knots, and the vessel’s bollard pull 
capacity is 4.8tonnes. 
Deck equipment includes:  an independent 
remotely controlled water monitor, rated  2,000litres 
per  minute at a pressure of 6bar, and  1,500litres per 
minute at 10bar; an electric salvage bilge pump, rated 
at 180litres per minute; a fire pump, rated at 830litres 
per minute; a surface air diving system with voice and 
recordable video communication;  and a hinged 
towing hook with balanced emergency release 
mechanism.

I
n the race to develop environmentally friendly 
small vessels capable of delivering an equivalent 
kick to diesel-fuelled, traditional models, the launch 
of the 5.5m x 1.6m, all-electric powerboat Bolt 18 
represents a welcome step forward in the evolution 
of green craft technology. The vessel is intended to 
be used as a tender yacht, transferring up to five 
passengers on short-runs ashore, as well as a source 
of sporting entertainment, as a means of towing 
water-skiers and wake boarders. 
This plucky contender has proved that electrically-
powered boats need not drastically sacrifice speed and 
performance to achieve an emissions-free solution. In 
November 2012, Bolt 18 scooped the British Water 
Speed record for vessels within the Unlimited Electric 
Runabout class at Coniston Power Boat Records Week, 
a five-day UK event dedicated to bringing all classes of 
vessels together to attempt record-breaking speeds. 
Beleaguered by poor weather conditions, Bolt 18 
nonetheless went on to achieve a speed of 32.8mph 
(28.5knots), thereby scoring an outright win within its 
designated class. 
However, designer and builder Mylne Yacht 
Design reveals that the craft can in fact achieve 
speeds surpassing 30knots when pushed to the limit 
– a feature that could have important future 
implications for leisure craft and similar vessel types 
in emission control areas (ECAs). 
David Gray, director at Mylne, explains: “This 
technology was used in the tenders because we 
wanted clean lines, light weight and unobstructed 
deck space. Petrol was ruled out, for safety reasons, 
and diesel propulsion was considered heavy and 
smelly, considering the boat also has a water-skiing 
function. Although more expensive initially, the 
electric option provided clean, long-term operation 
and minimal maintenance, and we could achieve the 
weight and range requirements for this application.”
The boat’s system, which was supplied by Regen 
Nautic of Florida, US, draws on a single battery, 
comprising 118 lithium cells, each rated at 66amp 
hours, which, combined, provide 24kWh worth of 
useful power. The battery pack is contained within a 
specially designed, watertight, aluminium box, 
which also houses the control electronics. According 
to Mylne, the battery pack lifespan should extend to 
beyond five years and a minimum of 2,000 recharge 
cycles before there is any notable reduction in 
charge life. The waterproofed, IP-rated PowerPro 
100 motor and controller are directly coupled to the 
vessel’s propeller shaft. 
This set-up grants Bolt 18 the ability to operate 
for 10 hours at a speed of 5knots, consuming 
2.2kW; for more than 30 minutes at a speed of 
20knots, consuming 40kW; and for approximately 
14 minutes, in good conditions, at a speed in excess 
of 30knots, a scenario which see the craft expend in 
the region of 100kW. 
The vessel was constructed with a built-in charger, 
rated at 5kW, which enables users to recharge from 
empty and claw back just under six hours of extra 
operation, when required, and a fast charge option 
is also available, which recharges the cells in less 
than 30 minutes, thus providing coverage in the 
event of an emergency, or when the vessel has to 
return to shore as quickly as possible. 
These current power output settings may make 
this particular propulsive configuration unsuitable 
for patrol vessels or harbour vessels at the time of 
writing; as Gray concedes: “For pure electric drive 
you have to consider your range and speed 
requirements. For a boat to cruise around at 5knots, 
you would not require the high-power motor, but 
you would need a large battery bank.” Some form of 
additional diesel input would be required for 
extended operations, or extra pulling power, but 
Bolt 18 is certainly a step in the right direction and 
its innovative design qualifies it as a significant 
small ship. And who knows what subsequent models 
may be developed in the near future; to quote Gray: 
“These are all developing technologies but solutions 
do exist, and prices are reducing all the time.”

T
he last time we featured Adrenalin Marine’s BRAtt 
model, it was as a prototype training tool, 
designed to grant tug cadets hands-on experience in 
steering and operating these vessel types in safe, 
shallow water environments (see Significant Small 
Ships of 2010). It could be said, then, that we were 
surprised but intrigued to see this class return to our 
pages, albeit this time as a functional, compact utility 
tug in its own right.
Using the class designation BRAtt 880-SU, the 9m x 
4.65m vessel is configured as a Z-drive tugboat, 
featuring Z-drive propulsion and fully operational 
barge-connecting winches, and is equipped for line 
handling and yarding, boasting pretty much the same 
gear as one might expect from a twin-screw azimuthing 
stern drive tug, albeit contained in a smaller package. 
This makes the BRatt 880-SU a potential candidate 
for shallow water operations and undertaking tasks in 
harbours with restricted space and confined layouts. 
Of course, power is somewhat reduced, but, given 
her size, the BRAtt 880-SU delivers a respectable 
running speed of 7knots and a bollard pull of 
2.7tonnes, courtesy of twin Cummins QSB engines, 
rated 157kW apiece. The vessel deploys an-welded 
steel hull structure, combined with an aluminium alloy 
wheelhouse, the latter of which has been resiliently 
mounted to keep noise and vibrations to a minimum 
for her two crew members. The vessel has also been 
kitted out with exterior floodlights, rated 200W, and a 
0.25m searchlight, while removable laminated fenders 
and vertical push knee fenders, all supplied by 
Schuyler, have been incorporated to protect the tug in 
its line of duty. Hydronic ‘bus’ heaters keep the 
windows clear and provide warmth in the wheelhouse, 
and the vessel’s hull coating system was supplied by 
offshore specialist International Paint. 
The vessel’s two barge-connecting winches are 
hydraulically driven, and each has a capacity of 30m of 
1.27cm, 6x19 steel fibre core rope, with a line pulling 
capacity of 30m per minute at 1.43tonnes.

F
or offshore wind farm array technicians, comfort has 
become a key consideration when heading out to these 
renewable energy installations. Seasick personnel can 
constitute a major health and safety risk, particularly when 
these offshore farms are situated in deep waters, of 30m and 
above, and located 100-200km from shore, as is the case 
with a number of new and forthcoming turbine arrays off 
the coasts of the UK, Germany and Norway. In order to 
preserve its low accident rate for boat-to-turbine technician 
transfers, the offshore wind farm support sector has come to 
investigate different boat designs in a bid to increase stability 
and reduce slamming and vibrations, with the small-
waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH) concept gaining 
popularity as a means of achieving these aims. 
Essex, UK-based boatbuilder CTruk has already focused 
on the production of turbine technician transfer vessels, 
securing an entry in last year’s round-up of significant new 
vessels with the delivery of the first-in-class transfer vessel 
CWind Alliance (see Significant Small Ships 2011, pp 14-15). 
However, August 2012 saw the group successfully deliver its 
first SWATH, CWind Astute, to Coastal Marine Renewables, 
with CTruk’s sister vessel operator division CWind handling 
day-to-day running of the vessel. 
Measuring nearly 20m x 7.5m, CWind Astute represents 
the first fruit of CTruk’s CWhisper class, which, the yard 
claims, has been developed to limit motions to approximately 
25% of those typically affecting catamaran-type transfer 
craft, thereby enabling turbine work crews to embark/
disembark in increased wave heights, and granting the vessel 
higher speeds in sea states of over 1m, in comparison to more 
conventional boat designs. CTruk has incorporated its 
dynamic ride control system into the vessel’s design, to result 
in reduced roll and pitch and subsequent smoother trips 
between shore and offshore array. 
According to the builder, this design has also had a direct 
effect on the amount of fuel consumed during journeys; sea 
trials, conducted in late August 2012, just prior to handover, 
revealed that the CWhisper debutante achieved a measured 
fuel consumption rate of less than 100litres per hour, when 
travelling at a service speed of 20knots. The trials also 
revealed that the force required to hold the new SWATH 
against the turbine transition piece was reduced to 25% of 
that needed by a conventional cat. 
Lightweight considerations are evident in CWind Astute’s 
hull arrangement, which has been forged from infused 
composite materials. As with CTruk’s range of multi-purpose 
catamarans, the SWATH features a moveable wheelhouse, 
incorporating the builder’s patented flexible pod design and 
enabling the operator to move the wheelhouse from the 
front of the vessel to the back, dependent on operational 
requirements. CWind Astute has an allocated forward deck 
space and aft deck space of 44m
2 apiece, and can rely on a 
fuel capacity of 6,000litres – granting the vessel a range of 
1,200nm – and a fresh water capacity of 300litres. 
If the provision of vessels dedicated to offshore wind farm 
technician transfers initially began with modified fishing 
vessels and tugs, the development of vessels dedicated to this 
lucrative sector is a welcome evolution, not least in offering a 
cost-effective, timely and safe means of keeping tabs on the 
performance of offshore wind assets.

vessel’s main deck features a mess/lounge, a galley 
with dry store space and freezer, a communal WC, 
laundry facilities and three quad cabins and a single 
crew cabin. The deckhouse above contains four 
single crew cabins with ensuite WC and an HVAC 
space. According to Robert Allan, the wheelhouse 
was designed for maximum all-round visibility, with 
two control stations providing enhanced visibility to 
both the fore and aft deck working areas. 
Fire Fighting Systems (FFS) supplied the vessel’s 
requirement for Fi-Fi 1 capabilities, in the form of a 
single, 3,000m
3 per hour fi-fi pump and two 
remotely operated FS1200 monitors, each rated at 
1,200m
3 per hour. Korean manufacturer A Rim 
Machinery provided the vessel with a single drum 
hawser winch at the bow and a waterfall-type towing 
winch on the aft deck. Ship-handling fenders at the 
bow comprise a 900mm x 450mm cylindrical fender 
above a row of 450mm ‘W' block fenders, while a 
350mm x 350mm hollow ‘D’ fender is intended to 
provide protection at the main and forecastle deck 
sheer lines. All vessel fendering was supplied by 
Lion Rubber Industries.

L
ate Summer saw Hong Kong builder Cheoy Lee 
Shipyards deliver a new 58m anchor handling 
tug / supply (AHTS) vessel to Kalenys Ship 
Management. Reported to be a popular AHTS type 
amongst Cheoy Lee’s Middle Eastern clientele, this 
latest delivery, El Chalten, was built on spec and was 
actually sold to the latter company whilst almost 
completed in January 2012, although a significant 
amount of modification work has been carried out, 
in order to satisfy Kalenys’s requirements – 
particularly when it comes to boosting the amount 
of personnel onboard. 
The design, which originates from Singapore-based 
Wärtsilä Ship Design, incorporates an all-steel hull and 
superstructure. As a result of the modification work, El 
Chalten is the first AHTS vessel in the series to have had 
its accommodation capacity increased. This has been 
achieved by converting the lower deck utility area, the 
main deck recreation room and forecastle deck meeting 
room into a set of four-man cabins, whilst also 
converting  a pair of two-man cabins to accommodate 
four instead. All crew are housed in the forward part of 
the vessel, which also contains the galley, mess rooms, 
sick bay and cold stores. Accommodation on the 
forecastle deck level includes individual cabins for the 
captain and chief engineer. The working deck aft is over 
30m long, with an area of approximately 350m
2. 
Sheathed in wood for protection, the steel deck plating 
is 20mm thick.
Propulsion is provided courtesy of two air start 
Caterpillar 3516C diesel engines, generating 1,894kW 
apiece and driving Berg controllable pitch propellers in 
nozzles via Reintjes LAF873, 7:1 reduction gearboxes. A 
12tonne Schottel bow thruster, directly driven by an 
810kW MAN diesel  engine, and a 4.5tonne Schottel 
electric stern thruster have also been fitted. Propulsion 
units and thrusters are controlled via a Schottel 
Masterstick joystick for enhanced manoeuvrability and 
precise control. Three Caterpillar 425kW generating sets 
have been added to El Chalten’s power set-up, to  
independently support the vessel’s loads, as has a  72kW 
back-up set, the latter also serving as a harbour generator.
Deck winches were provided by MacGregor and 
include a 200tonne towing/anchor handling winch, 
10tonne anchor windlass, two 10tonne tugger 
winches, and two 5tonne capstans. Towing equipment 
includes Triplex towing pins and a shark jaw. The 
vessel’s 0.75tonne@7m Hiab crane is tasked with 
handling provisions, in conjunction with a powerful 
new deck crane from North Pacific Crane in Seattle, 
US, which has a reach of 20m and is able to lift 22 
tonnes at a reduced reach of 11.6m.
Tank space was also revised in relation to the vessel as 
originally built. Now, with the capacity to handle 
400tonnes of fuel, El Chalten has managed to record a 
range of 6,500nm at 12knots.

svagt Aurora was delivered to Esvagt, a 
subsidiary of Danish multinational shipping 
operator A.P MØller-Maersk, in July 2012, for 
deployment in the Barents Sea, just south of the 
Arctic Ocean. The 87m loa, 81m-wide vessel has 
been placed on a 10-year charter contract to 
Norwegian oil major Eni Norge. The vessel’s main 
mission is to remain on stand-by within this 
territory, chiefly to provide assistance to offshore 
platforms in the event of emergencies. 
The vessel integrates the lastest technological 
developments for the launch and recovery of rescue 
boats, de-icing equipment to avoid ice accretion on 
decks, as well as pollution control gear, fulfilling 
the highest standards required by the Norwegian 
authorities for this type of vessel. Esvagt Aurora 
incorporates an X-bow design and can generate a 
combined total of 9,420kW of diesel-electric 
power, granting the vessel a bollard pull of 
100tonnes. 
The vessel has been equipped with a duplex 
dynamic positioning system, which enables the 
vessel to keep her position in rough sea conditions 
and against hurricane-force winds. This feature 
also enables Esvagt Aurora to operate remotely 
operated vehicles (ROVs )in deep seas, regardless 
of weather conditions.
The vessel features the capacities to carry up to 
1,200m
3 of fuel oil; 300m
3 of fresh water; 1,400m
3 
of ballast; and 50m
3 of dispersant, for use in 
firefighting operations. 
Esvagt Aurora and its equipment fully comply 
with the ‘Clean Design’ environmental class 
notation, in particular regarding emissions. It has 
also achieved a high DNV Comf-V notation due to 
low noise and vibration levels.

I
t’s rare that we get to profile a tanker in the pages of 
Significant Small Ships, but the 72.6m Gazpromneft 
Nordwest makes it in by virtue of its innovative design, as 
well as representing an example of predominantly Turkish 
workmanship, with designer Delta Marine, builder Gisan 
Shipyard and deck machinery supplier Gürdesan all 
contributing to this addition to Russian energy major 
Gazprom’s fleet. 
Designed as an oil and chemical carrier, with 
Unrestricted Navigation notation, Gazpromneft Nordwest 
features a twin propulsion system and a hull structure 
with a 1.54tonnes/m
3 density. The vessel has been fitted 
with eight pairs of cargo tanks and a slop tank, all of 
which feature double-skinned protection, and which are 
segregated from the crew accommodation, service / 
machinery spaces and vessel stores and drinking water 
supply. The vessel’s cargo tanks are divided by corrugated 
bulkheads in both directions, though the structures of 
these bulkheads do not interfere with the inner sides of 
the tanks, to subsequently minimise cleaning and tank 
maintenance times. 
Tank cleaning is facilitated by the inclusion of a fixed, 
turbine-driven cleaning machine, capable of operating at 
a pressure of 8-9bar. Together, it has been estimated that 
the cargo tank arrangement could grant the vessel a 
revenue-earning capacity equal to 2,633m
3. 
Loading and unloading is handled by electrically driven 
submergible deep well pumps, featuring 150m
3/hour 
capacity for the cargo tanks, and 100m
3/hour capacity for 
the slop tank. Each pair of cargo tanks has its own 
common cargo manifold line, so that four different 
substances can be loaded/unloaded simultaneously, while 
an extra manifold line caters to the slop tank. 
Gazpromneft Nordwest also features an innovative 
wheelhouse design, deploying a round shape and an 
enhanced deck height for high visibility. The wheelhouse 
accommodates an engine console, enabling bridge-based 
crew to control all engine, cargo tank and ballast water 
tank operations from within.  Crew accommodation is 
located in the aft part of the tanker. 
In terms of avoiding high fuel consumption rates and 
limiting emissions, Delta Marine worked alongside 
partner company Mesh Engineering & Software, in 
conducting potential flow analysis to identify parameters 
such as wave resistance and dynamic pressure distribution, 
using in-house DeltaFlow software. This was followed by 
a number of detailed CFD studies, covering factors such 
as calculations of the ship’s friction, form and wave 
resistance, in order to realise the creation of an  improved 
and efficient hull form. 
Use of FEA tools during the design process also enabled 
the designer to optimise ship safety, weight and vibration 
characteristics, and Gazpromneft Nordwest’s payload has 
been enhanced so as to keep the lightweight at a 
minimum, whilst still complying with relevant rules for 
hull structure and integrity.

R
epresenting an investment of GBP£35 million (US$56 
million), Grampian Don, which was delivered in January 
2012, is the first of a brand new, four-strong series of standby 
emergency response and rescue vessels (ERRVs) built by 
Spain’s Astilleros Balenciaga for Scottish shipowner North Star 
Shipping. The 50.7m vessel was developed in conjunction 
with designer OSD-IMT, and, according to Astilleros 
Balenciaga, was delivered a month in advance of the specified 
contract delivery date. 
As with most vessels in North Star’s fleet, Grampian Don will 
offer ERRV support coverage to oil rigs in the Northern sector 
of the North Sea, where it will spend 28 days of every month, 
only returning to port for crew changes and for loading fuel, 
stores and spares. The vessel is designed and outfitted to 
oversee the rescue of up to 300 people in any given incident. 
Working in tandem with the shipowner’s technical and 
commercial staff, OSD-IMT designed the vessel to feature a 
high freeboard and full lines above the water line forward, 
while the IMT S-bow is intended to confront the harsh, 
Winter-time conditions that the vessel will be subjected to in 
the North Sea. The forward-facing, full-breadth deckhouse 
front on the forecastle deck offers a large wall to shield the 
wheelhouse, which is located quite far aft, from greenwater in 
heavy sea conditions.
As a standby vessel, Grampian Don features a crew capacity 
for up to 15 persons, together with a dedicated survivor 
accommodation and treatment area. In order to house all of 
the crew, and potentially up to 300 recovered persons, whilst 
using as little internal space as possible, the superstructure sides 
have been taken to the full beam in all accommodation decks. 
This arrangement has contributed to provide the crew 
members with greater comfort.
Below decks the vessel is subdivided, by watertight 
bulkheads, into the following sections: the bow thruster 
compartment, aft of the fore peak; the survivor seating area, 
forward of the machinery; and the genset compartment, aft, 
separated from the engine control room compartment by a 
watertight, remotely operated hydraulic door.  
Accommodation is divided into three levels, with the 
wheelhouse being the fourth, and the crew’s quarters are 
divided over the two decks above the main deck, primarily 
consisting of single-man cabins with en suite washrooms.  All 
machinery spaces are flanked by wing tanks, effectively 
forming a double hull throughout the length of the vessel.
Heila was chosen to supply Grampian Don’s hydraulic 
telescopic knuckle boom crane, which features a 1.8tonne 
capacity at 15m outreach. The function of the crane, in 
addition to the usual loading of spares and handling 
equipment in port, is the deployment of the scoop over the 
vessel’s side when performing rescue operations.
The entire ship has been kitted out with pumps 
manufactured by Bombas Azcue. Among these, there is a large 
electric pump supplying the regulatory superstructure deluge 
system, with jet nozzles distributed around the superstructure 
and the whole perimeter of the vessel, providing protection 
from any irradiated heat the vessel may need to face during 
rescue operations. Fuel oil and lubricating oil purifiers, of the 
self- cleaning type, have been supplied by GEA Westfalia.
To meet the latest IMO requirements regarding pollution 
prevention, the propulsion engines have been manufactured to 
comply with IMO Tier II exhaust gas emissions criteria. 
Similarly, a sewage treatment plant and bilge water separator 
have been fitted.
Below the main deck, an area located forward of the 
machinery serves as a dedicated seating area for rescued 
persons, replete with washroom facilities. The galley, 
provision rooms and shared crew living areas and rescue 
facilities are found on the main deck, which enables access 
from the weather deck for survivors to enter the 
accommodation area, and the furniture in the galley is 
manufactured in stainless steel. 
The forecastle deck holds spacious cabins for the captains 
and chief engineers, as well as other officer types, all of which 
come with washroom facilities. The ship’s office is also located 
on this level.
In the wheelhouse, a console, situated forward, features all of 
the ship’s controls as well as the two radars, a chart plotter, an 
automation system display, some radio equipment and 
communications systems. The forward console has two helm 
seats, providing the skipper and bridge officers with a 
comfortable command position that has all manoeuvring 
controls at hand. The aft console has a split console with a 
sliding helm seat in between. On the bridge wings, there are 
two consoles with fixed joystick controls, providing enhanced 
visibility over the rescue and fast rescue craft (FRC) 
deployment zones. The chart table, with chart drawers 
underneath, lays forward of the aft control station. For rescue 
operations, the vessel is provided with two Delta Phantom-
class daughter RIBs and one Avon Searide 6,5m fast rescue 
craft, which are raised and lowered by suitable hydraulically 
operated davits, supplied by NMD. Other appliances for 
rescuing survivors from the water are the Dacon scoop and a 
Cosalt rescue basket, both of which are operated from onboard 
the vessel, and do not require any of the ship’s crew to leave the 
safety of the vessel.

F
ollowing the retirement of its 44m loa rescue 
cruiser Wilhelm Kaisen, after 34 years of service, 
the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service 
(DGzRS) has complemented its fleet with the 
replacement Harro Koebke, a 36.45m loa rescue vessel 
designed and built to generate a top speed of 25knots. 
The vessel’s primary functions will be to provide 
search and rescue (SAR) services for maritime casualties, 
and medical assistance to persons in distress, in the 
Baltic Sea, and it is currently stationed at Sassnitz, a 
town on Rügen Island. 
Harro Koebke’s hull, deck and superstructure are 
fashioned entirely from aluminium. However, while 
the boat was designed with lightship capabilities very 
much in mind (not least as a means of reducing fuel 
cost and limiting emissions), it has also been 
constructed with a double hull, to enhance 
performance in the event of damage being sustained 
below the waterline. The hull volume is 500mm over 
the construction waterline. 
In extensive tests, during the earliest stages of the 
design process, a radio-controlled, fibreglass model of 
Harro Koebke, scaled to 1:22, was demonstrated to be 
able to retain manoeuvrability in significant wave 
heights of up to 5.6m.
The boat can accommodate up to 11 members of 
personnel, most typically operating on a 14-day basis, 
with five members acting as crew at any given time. 
Given these periods away from shore, it was decided to 
furnish Harro Koebke with a biological wastewater 
treatment plant, supplied by German specialist 
manufacturer Ocean Clean. Six permanent seats have 
been built into the bridge. 
The vessel is powered by a main MTU 16V 4000 
M71 engine, generating 2,465kW, and two MTU 8V 
4000 M70 engines, producing 1,160kW apiece. The 
main engine also drives Harro Koebke’s fire extinguisher 
system, which has a range of 110m. The fire 
suppression system aboard the vessel has a capacity of 
600m
3 per hour, and can be operated remotely from 
the bridge. In addition, shipbuilder Fassmer has 
installed a foam extinguishing device which can 
provide a capacity of 144m
3 per hour, via mobile 
monitors. The vessel also deploys MTU’s Callosum 
integrated ship automation system, for greater control 
over the propulsive arrangement, especially when the 
pilot wishes to break into high-speed mode. 
To facilitate emergency rescues and to assist stricken 
casualties as quickly as possible, the vessel has also been 
gifted a helicopter platform, featuring a tow hook with 
a safe working load of 15tonnes and a towing winch 
with a clamping force of 12tonnes and a pulling force 
of 3tonnes. The helicopter deck leads directly to an 
onboard multi-functional clinic zone, for urgent 
treatment of casualties. 
Additionally, Harro Koebke carries a 4.7tonne, 8.9m 
daughter craft, supplied by UK-based Marine 
Specialised Technology, which can be launched astern.

esigned by Icarus Marine of South Africa, and 
built by Hong Kong’s Wang Tak Engineering & 
Shipbuilding Co Ltd, the 12.46m catamaran HAWC12 
was delivered, in October 2012, to owner Hydrofoil 
Assisted Water Craft (HAWC) Technologies Ltd, 
which was established in 2005. The vessel was 
designed to patrol the waterways in the Sai Kung 
region, within the Hong Kong Global Geopark of 
China, one of the members of the UNESCO-
supported Global Geoparks Network, as well as to 
carry park rangers between the 70-plus islands situated 
within this zone. In addition to patrol work, HAWC12 
will also serve as a dive support boat. 
The decision to select a HAWC for this mission was 
based on the open and rough water commonly encountered 
in the Sai Kung region, year-round. The HAWC concept is 
intended to remove the hazard of slamming and ensure a 
stable ride, with the cat’s foil producing a lifting action to 
significantly reduce water resistance. The vessel was 
constructed in accordance to DNV’s High Speed Light 
Craft (HSLC) Rules and classed as a Hong Kong Marine 
Department Class IIA workboat. 
HAWC12’s wheelhouse and passenger saloon have 
been integrated into a single, air-conditioned and 
spacious cabin, featuring a toilet and shower facility, 
and, for additional passenger comfort, Wang Tak 
installed Cleeman hydraulic suspension-bolstered pilot 
seats and aircraft-type passenger seats. A pre-fabricated, 
decorated deckhouse module has been designed to 
simply ‘plug in’ to the cat, and can be alternated, 
meaning that a new deckhouse configuration can be 
effected, depending on the requirements of the boat’s 
latest mission. Wang Tak estimates that an alternative 
deckhouse can be fitted, and the boat put back into 
service, within a turnaround of one week. 
When in dive support vessel mode, HAWC12 can 
rely on storage facilities for scuba tanks and diving 
equipment and a swim platform. The latter platform 
features two stowed diver access ladders, and serves as 
a protective ‘bumper guard’ to the vessel’s twin 
waterjets, supplied by Australia-headquartered 
manufacturer Doen. The aft deck is covered by an 
awning and has the space to accommodate more 
diving gear, as well as racks for scuba tanks and a 
removable work bench. 
Cushioning is provided to the bow and the hull sides 
by D-shaped, urethane-covered, foam-filled sectional 
fenders, to mitigate the effects of any knocks while 
berthing. The vessel can achieve a top speed of 36knots 
at 3,400rpm, thanks to a power train comprising a pair 
of 299kW engines manufactured by MarineDiesel of 
Sweden, driving ZF220 gearboxes coupled to the 
aforementioned waterjets, via a Python-Drive unit.

S
afehaven’s 11.7m loa GRP pilot boat Interceptor 
took to the water in 2012 and, at time of going to 
press, is currently seeking a buyer.  Based on the 
builder’s Interceptor 38 class, and built under survey 
by class society Bureau Veritas, the vessel incorporates 
what has become something of a trademark for 
Safehaven, in the form of a deep V, twin chine hull 
form, featuring a deep skeg to protect the vessel’s 
stern gear, as well as to provide maximum efficiency. 
Interceptor has been designed for multiple 
operational roles, including pilotage, coastal patrol 
and search and rescue (SAR). Combined with a 
potential top speed of 29knots, this rota of duties 
makes it crucial that the boat is fully self-righting – as 
a glance at the accompanying photograph, of the 
vessel operating in tempestuous 10m seas, will testify. 
With this in mind, Safehaven has developed a 
number of special features to protect the crew and 
vessel should the vessel roll over. As well as working 
on the superstructure’s buoyancy at the design stage, 
to ensure self-righting capability, the boat has been 
equipped with automatically closing crossover air 
vents past 70degs, as well as watertight doors and 
19mm-thick, double-glazed, reinforced glass 
windows. Additionally, special engine breathing, fuel 
and exhaust features prevent the engines from cutting 
out during roll over. 
The boat is heavily fendered, to cope with the 
knocks and scrapes of pilot operations, while the aft 
deck is enclosed with safety railings and the side deck 
features removable guard rails, to facilitate SAR 
missions. Also, a man overboard (MOB) recovery 
davit can be folded out from Interceptor’s 
superstructure, in order to deploy a Jason’s Cradle 
recovery net. 
Multiple CCTV cameras and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) 
thermal cameras have been included onboard, 
providing live monitoring of the boat’s engine room 
and forward and aft areas. Captured footage is 
displayed on a large screen, located at the helm. A 
3kW inverter provides 240V worth of onboard 
electrical power for the vessel.
According to designer Frank Kowalski, “car 
standard ergonomics” have been added to bolster 
comfort in the wheelhouse and cabins. Interceptor can 
accommodate up to two crew members and up to 
four pilots on CAB 500 suspension seats, complete 
with harnesses. The forward cabin can accommodate 
up to six survivors. In sea trials, the combination of 
twin Volvo D9 engines, driven through ZF V drive 
gearboxes and turning five-bladed propellers, has 
resulted in a low onboard noise level of 75dBA when 
operating at a service speed of 23knots. The vessel 
also carries an RFD lifeboat, with six persons 
capacity, and can store up to 1,500litres of fuel and 
200litres of water at any given time.

012 saw the delivery of the first in a series of five 
versatile coastguard vessels, destined primarily for 
maritime surveillance, border and fisheries control, 
environmental protection, firefighting and rescue and 
civil protection and diving operations. Following a 
successful tender in 2009, Estonia’s Baltic Workboats 
was awarded the contract to design and build five new 
fast patrol vessels for the Swedish Coast Guard, with 
specified requirements including the lowest possible 
vessel lifecycle costs, high efficiency, high working 
environment standards and the lowest possible impact 
on the environment. 
The 26.5m KBV 312 design is based on Baltic 
Workboats’ Patrol 24 platform, and has undergone 
model testing and CFD calculations to result in lower 
resistance, better sea-keeping and a special hull shape 
for IPS installation. As a result of these tests, Baltic 
Workboats estimates that propulsion resistance has 
been lowered by 15%. FEM calculations were also 
extensively undertaken during hull structure design. 
To keep the weight down and avoid excessive welding, 
a large part of the hull is formed of extruding 
aluminium panels. Strict weight control was 
implemented during the construction process. 
To fulfil  noise and vibration requirements, the 
whole lower accommodation is resiliently mounted, as 
is the wheelhouse, and noise damping panels were 
installed.  As a result, the noise level in the wheelhouse 
has been measured at 55dBA, and that in the 
accommodation area at 63dBA, when the vessel is 
operating at full speed. 
KBV 312 features Volvo Penta’s  IPS 1050 complete 
propulsion system, including triple D13-800 main 
engines, with a total output of 1,764 kW, and IPS 3 
fully integrated pod units. Batic Workboats claims this 
has resulted in up to 40 % lower fuel consumption 
over the whole speed range and reduced CO2 and 
NOx emissions. During sea trials the vessel reached a 
speed of 34knots fully laden,  and the time taken to 
accelerate from idle to 20 knots was 7.5 seconds.
The central main engine can be clutched out so that 
engine power can be used to power the vessel’s fire 
pump, with a capacity of 1,800litres per minute @10 
bar. During firefight mode, the vessel can be 
maneuvered with the outer engines.  Steering of the 
vessel during docking and normal driving is handled 
via joystick instead of a steering wheel, altogether there 
are five control stations. The control system of the 
vessel is enhanced by a dynamic positioning system. 
The vessel has a 10tonne bollard pull capability and its 
hull is ice-strengthened, enabling it to operate in up to 
5cm ice thickness.
KBV 312 is able to accommodate five crew members. 
The onboard HVAC system was designed to according 
to DNV COMF-C(3) requirements and features full 
air conditioning, an overpressure ventilation system 
with waste heat recovery and a carbon filter for work in 
contaminated air.
Deck equipment includes a 5.5m RIB boat, a crane 
for lifting the RIB and other equipment, a rescue net, 
diving equipment, and a FLIR camera for patrol and 
rescue operations.

L
ady Anna hit the water in January 2012, as the first 
in a series of four vessels, designed to Groot Ship 
Design’s Sea River Liner 3700 class, for Dutch short 
sea operator Wjinne Barends, and intended to carry a 
range of cargoes including forestry products, steel 
coils, paper, salt, cement and dangerous cargoes, 
among others. The vessel is primarily trading in 
North-West Europe, taking in the North and Baltic 
Seas, as well as rivers such as the Rhine, in the 
Netherlands and Germany, and the Loire, in France, 
though Groot also designed Lady Anna to access Lake 
Vanern, Sweden. 
To keep a lid on fuel consumption, the vessel features 
just one main engine, a 746kW Caterpillar 3508. As 
well as guaranteeing lower emissions in its operational 
areas (many of which are designated as ECAs), the fact 
that Lady Anna’s main engine power falls below 
750kW means she can be operated without a dedicated 
chief engineer, as long as a shore support programme is 
in place – a useful scenario for operators looking to 
quickly assemble a crew whilst potentially reducing 
manpower costs. 
Conoship International worked closely alongside 
Groot in developing the vessel’s hull lines, including a 
number of CFD runs and tests undertaken at the 
Duisburg tank facility, in cooperation with MARIN. 
As a result, the aftship features a small gondola 
supporting the stern tube, and a tunnel shape, enabling 
water to flow smoothly from below the keel towards 
the propeller. The foreship features a large bulbous 
bow, to achieve an efficient waterline length and 
sufficient volume to enable the cargo hold to run as far 
as possible to the forward end of the vessel. 
Lady Anna was built with a box-shaped single hold, 
with a clear 62.3m x 10.8m opening and a capacity of 
just over 5,150m
3, and the permissible homogenous 
tanktop load is rated at 14.7tonnes per m
2. The tanktop 
can be loaded with steel coils and features grabs to 
provide extra strength during the discharging process. 
The hull is also strengthened for loading/unloading 
aground, which means that Lady Anna is able to call at 
small ports in the UK. 
The ship has also been kitted out with 10 pontoon-
type hatches, operated via a single gantry crane, all of 
which has been supplied by Coops & Nieborg. The 
gantry crane can be lowered alongside the main 
coaming to ensure the lowest possible air draught. 
All hatch covers have been designed to carry a 
homogenous deck load of 3.85tonnes per m
3 on Panel 1; 
3.47tonnes per m
3 on Panel 2; and 3.21tonnes per m
3 on 
all remaining panels. The two most aft panels have been 
fitted with dovetail foundations, enabling the carriage of 
containers, and the hatches feature supports for the 
carriage of wood packages. 
An onboard hydraulic cylinder also has the capability 
to lower the wheelhouse aft, enabling an air draught of 
8.7m at a water draught of 3.5m.

A
ustal’s track record for innovation in aluminium 
monohull construction continued in 2012, with 
the delivery of the 35.2m loa Mary D Odyssey to New 
Caledonia-based tourism company Mary D Enterprises 
in January. As of April 2012, the vessel has been 
operating primarily between Nouméa and Amadee 
Island, as well as other locations on the southern and 
western coasts of New Caledonia. 
From the planning stage onwards, crew comfort and 
space were key considerations of this project. Austal tells 
Significant Small Ships that the vessel’s propulsive set-up, 
comprising three MTU 12V 2000 engines driving 
Hamilton waterjets through ZF gearboxes, was selected 
to marry smooth and quiet sails with high-speed 
performance, with Mary D Odyssey capable of travelling 
at up to 36knots. Her fuel capacity is rated at 9,000litres. 
The ferry can take up to 138 passengers, split 
between two decks. The upper deck lounge has been 
designed on an ‘open plan’ basis, with seating arranged 
around tables, while the main passenger deck area 
features a mixture of row and table seating, in addition 
to wide aisles and staircases to bolster the impression of 
light and space – a factor enhanced by the presence of 
large, tinted windows on each deck. 
Both decks are air-conditioned, with the HVAC units 
being mounted on the bulkhead, so as to avoid the need 
for in-calling ducting and vents, making maintenance 
simpler for the vessel’s 12-strong crew, and to provide 
more headroom for passengers. For additional comfort, 
Austal selected Beurteaux’s Ocean Tourist range of high-
back seats for the vessel’s passengers. The main passenger 
area contains large racks for passenger luggage storage, 
and the aft deck also contains space for luggage, which 
can be lifted aboard by a crane situated on the vessel’s 
starboard quarter. 
The rear of the main deck is complemented by a 
kiosk, for the serving of hot and cold beverages, and 
which doubles up as the ship’s main PA / tannoy-
enabled info hub. A pair of unisex toilets, a toilet for 
disabled users and a baby change area are located 
forward on the main passenger deck. 
To facilitate swift cargo loading and unloading, the 
starboard access doors amidships on the main deck have 
been designed in a wider manner than on previous 
Austal vessels of this type. The access doors are 
supplemented by port or starboard bulwark gates 
accessing the main aft deck. The wheelhouse, 
meanwhile, features the Austal Marine Link monitoring 
and control system and ergonomically designed 
navigation and control stations. Mary D Odyssey is fully 
compliant with the IMO High Speed Craft (HSC) 
Code 2000.

O
ne of the more newsworthy tug deliveries in 2012 
was the handover of Ocean Wave, the first of four 
twin-screw vessels built by Lousiana-based Bollinger 
Shipyards, to tug fleet operator Crowley Maritime 
Corporation. Power is the name of the game, with 
designer and Crowley subsidiary Jensen Maritime 
Consultants having developed the vessels in the brand 
new Ocean class to handle long-range ocean towage, 
including platform tows, transfers of FPSO units and 
rigs, emergency response, firefighting and salvage 
operations. Within the context of Crowley’s own 
transport services, the design has been realised to 
complement the company’s new 455-series of high 
deck-strength, 122m x 32m barges. 
Ocean Wave and identical sister newbuild Ocean Wind 
have been specified to ABS-certified DP1 dynamic 
positioning class, while the longer, 47.5m third and 
fourth vessels in the series, Ocean Sky and Ocean Sun 
will be equipped to DP2 standard upon completion. 
Ocean Wave and Ocean Wind each rely on two 
Caterpillar C280-12 main engines, providing a 
combined output of 8,112kW, driving controllable 
pitch propellers in fixed nozzles through Reintjes LAF 
5666 reduction gears. The main machinery has been 
designed to operate on low sulphur diesel fuel, and is 
compliant with the US Environmental Protection 
Agency’s (EPA) Tier 2 requirements, and suitable for 
upgrading to Tier 3 or Tier 4 criteria. As a result of this 
immense power arrangement, Ocean Wave and its sister 
each feature a bollard pull of 147tonnes, and, Bollinger 
estimates, boasts a range of approximately 12,600nm at 
a free running speed of 15knots. 
The initial Ocean class duo utilise high-lift rudders, 
while manoeuvrability is enhanced by a Berg 634kW 
bow thruster in Ocean Wave and Ocean Wind, and by a 
373kW Berg bow and stern units in each of the 
forthcoming, larger tugs. 
Each tug features a waterfall-type Intercon hydraulic 
towing winch with 914m of 63.5mm wire and 1,219m 
of 69.85mm wire. The outfit includes retractable pins, 
shark jaws, stern roller, auxiliary wire drum and 
Intercon bow winch. The main towing gear is 
controlled from the wheelhouse, in the interests of 
keeping the deck clear of personnel and creating safer 
and more efficient working conditions. 
Environmental considerations have also played a part in 
the development of the Ocean class. Jensen has 
incorporated a double-hull configuration into the design, 
so that all oil tanks are situated inboard of the inner side 
shell, to decrease the likelihood of a spill in the aftermath of 
an accident. The tugs also hold Green Passports, which 
document materials present in a vessel’s structure, systems 
and equipment that may be hazardous to health or the 
environment. The Green Passport will be regularly updated 
and maintained, and eventually passed by the owner to the 
recycling yard at the end of the tug’s life, to better ensure 
safe and environmentally-sound breaking and recycling. 
The vessels are transverse framed with transverse and 
longitudinal bulkheads, including the collision bulkhead, 
which extends to the main deck.

O
ceanic is the first off the blocks in the Hartman 
M2 Runner class of 3,500dwt general / project 
cargo ships, designed, by Hartman Marine, in 
conjunction with Conoship International, with an 
emphasis on transporting offshore wind turbine 
parts between shore and deep waters. The deck area 
and hold volume have been maximised within the 
3,000gt limit, enabling Oceanic to transport as 
many wind turbine sections as a standard 6,000dwt 
ship can manage. 
Construction and detailed engineering were 
handled by Vuyk Engineering Groningen, while 
Shipkits built the hull and Hartmann Marine 
handled the outfitting and commissioning of the 
ship. Oceanic’s initial model underwent extensive 
testing at the MARIN facility, in the Netherlands, 
and has attained the class notation ‘Open Top’, 
enabling the vessel to transport cargoes whose 
dimensions exceed the dimensions of the closed 
hold – for instance, cargoes such as cranes, boilers 
and wind turbine foundations. In order to enable 
the passage of large cargo items on the deck, it was 
decided to construct Oceanic with a wider than 
usual rubbing strake on both sides of the deck. A 
second rubbing strake has been included far below 
the ‘upper’ one. 
To attain as large a deck area as possible, Oceanic’s 
deckhouse was situated asymmetrically at the 
starboard aft. The vessel’s hatches have been built to 
a ‘flush’ design, and are able to withstand loads of 
up to 3.5tonnes per m
2. The vessel’s hold features a 
height of 8.3m and a width of 12.5m, and the 
movable tweendecks are capable of withstanding 
loads of up to 2.5tonnes per m
2. This hold width – 
unusually large, perhaps, for the hold of a vessel 
with a moulded breadth of 14m – was partly 
achieved by designing the wing tanks to be as 
narrow as possible. The hold is equipped with a 
sprinkler system and has been certified as fit to carry 
dangerous class 1 cargoes. 
The vessel deploys a single Wärtsilä 6L20, rated at 
1,200kW, as its main engine, driving a Wärtsilä-
manufactured controllable pitch propeller. This 
engine is being monitored by Wärtsilä from the 
manufacturer’s base in Finland, meaning that there 
is no requirement for Oceanic to sail with a chief 
engineer onboard. The service speed in loaded 
condition is estimated to be around 11.5knots, 
increasing to 12.5knots when the vessel is in ballast 
condition.

I
n what makes the grade as the fastest significant small 
ship to be profiled in this year’s round-up, the 13.2m, 
42knot Owaijah II certainly represents an inspirational 
lightweight model for high-speed patrol craft. 
Designed and constructed as the first of UK boatbuilder 
Alnmaritec’s new Wave Prowler class, the aluminium 
vessel features a low-profile, asymmetric catamaran hull 
form, which was developed in conjunction with BMT 
Nigel Gee. Following delivery, the vessel has been 
deployed on oil terminal and port security patrol duties in 
the Arabian Gulf, courtesy of operator SMIT, with 
intercept duties factored into her design requirements. 
The wheelhouse, which has been designed to be as 
spacious and comfortable for crew as possible, provides 
suspension seating, supplied by UK manufacturer Kab, 
for a total of eight crew members and passengers. This 
section also hosts WC facilities and is fully air 
conditioned, to cope with the harsh ambient conditions 
in the Middle East. 
The vessel is fitted with the two Cummins QSC600 
engines, driving  Rolls-Royce Kamewa A32 waterjets 
through ZF gearboxes, and the resultant top speed of 
42knots means that Owaijah II constitutes, to date, 
the fastest vessel produced at Alnmaritec’s facilities. 
Speaking shortly after the vessel’s delivery in February 
2012, Chris Millman, Alnmaritec managing director, 
said he was hopeful that Owaijah II would “provide a 
future reference point for further developments of 
high-speed craft from Alnmaritec.”Additionally, 
integrated interceptors are intended to provide the 
patrol cat with ride control and excellent high-speed 
handling. The vessel has also been kitted out with a 
dive platform, situated aft, while a bimini cover has 
been included, to provide protection from direct 
sunlight during operations on the aft deck. 
The cat has a fuel capacity of 1,726litres, and a 
fresh water capacity of 42litres, and is capable of 
carrying a SOLAS B-compliant, eight-person Ocean 
Safety liferaft.

T
he 81.2m loa Polaris is the first in a series of three 
pilot station vessels designed specifically for 
operation near the Dutch ports of Rotterdam and 
Vlissingen, and will serve as a base station for pilots 
utilising fast launch craft (FLC) to and from inbound 
and outbound ships at these key destinations. 
Polaris was designed by Conoship International, in 
cooperation with Barkmeijer Shipyards and SasTech, 
and with Groot Ship Design elaborating the 
constructional design aspects. The vessel is equipped 
with two FLC on the starboard side and one on the 
port side, all launched from davits, which can operate 
in significant wave heights of up to 3.5m, and in the 
face of wind speeds of 8-9Bft. In a seaway, when the 
speed is reduced close to zero, Polaris will keep its 
heading to the actual wind direction, to create a lee 
side, thus sheltering the pilots whilst they are 
transferring to and from the FLC. The FLC have been 
designed to be lowered into the water safely at a tidal 
speed of up to 6knots. 
The ship propulsion system consists of two nozzled 
fixed pitch propellers, each driven by an electric motor. 
The power is produced by six diesel generator sets, to 
enable optimal power efficiency at each load condition. 
The installation and power management system were 
developed by D&A Electric. The power is sufficient to 
produce a speed of 14knots when sailing in head waves 
with a significant wave height of 2.8m, increasing to a 
maximum speed of 16.5knots. In the event of an 
emergency, Polaris is able to accelerate from zero to 
13knots within one minute when in ‘kick down’ 
mode, and maximum propulsion thrust can be reached 
within only 24seconds. Two fish tail rudders provide 
maximum manoeuvrability at low speeds.
One of the main design objectives was a high 
operability, which is achieved by a high level of 
redundancy: application of double and separated 
engine rooms and propulsion rooms (propulsion 
systems), two main switchboard rooms, two bow 
thrusters, two steering gear rooms, and so on. Another 
important design objective was the ergonomics of the 
ship, and, subsequently, the most important 
instruments on the bridge, necessary for daily 
operations, have been positioned within hand reach of 
the captain. A special workspace for the pilots has also 
been created on a lower level of the bridge, so that the 
captain is not distracted and so that the pilots do not 
interfere with his visibility.

U
K boatbuilder Lochin Marine International has carved 
out a niche for itself in the production of high-speed 
police and patrol craft and 2012 saw the launch and delivery 
of the 11m x 3.8m patrol boat Preventer, which was 
specifically contracted, by the Hampshire Police Authority 
Marine Unit, to cover an estimated 1,500 hours’ worth of 
work per annum, patrolling the intensely busy Solent 
waterway, and the Sussex, Hampshire and Dorset coastlines. 
The vessel is also intended to be used for boarding and 
approaching smaller vessels in the Solent and adjacent 
waters, in cooperation with the Maritime and Coastguard 
Agency and the UK Border Agency. According to Lochin 
Marine International: “As her name suggests, Preventer will 
not only remind boat users of a policing presence afloat, but 
also serve the significant tonnage, including the cruise ships, 
that navigate to the Southampton terminals.”
Preventer, which was designed by Amgram and completed 
by pilot boat construction specialist Goodchild Marine 
Services, has a maximum speed capability of 27knots and a 
top range of 250nm, thanks to a pair of Cummins 
Mercruiser Quantum QSB5.9 312.6kW engines driven 
through Twin Disc MGX5065A electronic gearboxes. These 
gearboxes feature specially created ‘tunnels’, in order to 
maximise performance and economy of operation, while the 
craft’s electronics system, supplied by Sweden-based 
EmpirBus CANbus, was selected to minimise the amount of 
cabling required, whilst providing a state-of-the-art interface 
for compatible wheelhouse electronic aids, including 
functions such as surveillance, underwater search, remotely 
operated vehicle (ROV) deployment and overboard recovery. 
Lochin Marine International tells Significant Small Ships 
that, as a rough example, this system also grants the vessel the 
ability to keep its lights on five minutes after the engine has 
been switched off, to enable its crew to disembark safely.
When it comes to recovery, Preventer has also been 
designed with a submersible rear platform, allowing the crew 
to retrieve objects, such as bodies, from the water. Interior 
accommodation includes dedicated operating desks for 
surveillance and monitoring equipment and four suspension 
seats in the cabin, while space for another five seats are 
located to the vessel’s forward. “In addition, the boat features 
lockers which can also be used as seating,” Lochin says.

S
ituated within Jinhae Bay, at the southernmost 
end of the Korean peninsula, Sungdong 
Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (Sungdong) 
claims to have identified its niche in plugging the 
gap between the large vessel construction yards, 
which dominate the country’s shipbuilding 
landscape, and the small-to-medium-sized ship 
construction segment.
In August 2012, Sungdong delivered Sajo 
Columbia, the first of two new tuna purse seiner 
sister ships to Sajo Industries, a Korea-based deep-
sea fishing specialist. The 79.5m vessels have been 
designed with a series of multi-purpose tasks in 
mind, including spotting and catching fish, in 
addition to storing, refrigerating, transporting and 
unloading these consignments. 
Sajo Columbia’s design specifications include a 
raked stern with a bulbous bow, a transom stern 
with an open water-type stern frame, a semi-
balanced rudder and a fixed pitch propeller, driven 
directly by the vessel’s main medium-speed Niigata 
diesel engine. The engine was derated in order to 
grant Sajo Industries a greater degree of fuel 
economy. 
The vessel features a continuous second deck and 
upper deck, complete with deck houses, and 
accommodates fish holds, fuel oil tanks, fresh water 
tanks, machinery space, working space and space for 
the bow thrusters. 
The spaces between the fish hold liner plates and 
adjacent bulkheads, shell plate, decks, tank tops and 
coaming interior are foam-insulated. 
Batches of caught fish are transported directly to 
the fish holds via a turret that runs through the 
upper deck, as well as by a conveyor system designed 
with side transfer chutes. The vessel’s refrigeration 
equipment has a freezing capacity of 408tonnes per 
24 hours. When it comes to unloading the vessel’s 
haul, the fish are conveyed through a set of 
unloading doors situated between the fish holds, 
either to the forward unloading hatch or two 
unloading hatches located in the aft. 
When operating at a scantling draught of 5.85m, 
the vessel is able to achieve a speed of 15.4knots at 
90% MCR, equating to 2,978kW, while maximum 
speed at normal draught has been recorded at 
17knots. The vessel is also equipped with a steel 
skiff boat, built with a main engine rated at 
735.5kW, which can be lifted by a boom with 
winches and rigs.

hen it comes to the production of icebreaking 
multipurpose support vessels (IMSVs), Royal 
Neistern Sander, a subsidiary of Dutch designer 
Conoship, might just have upped the stakes following the 
2012 delivery of the 68.2m loa Sanaborg and her sister, 
Serkeborg. 
Developed in collaboration with Finnish interests – 
namely, builder Aker Arctic and power systems specialist 
Wärtisilä – the vessels have been developed for operation 
in the ice-infested waters of the North Caspian Sea. 
Duties include: icebreaking and ice management; towing 
and pushing of cargo barges in open and ice-infested 
waters; transporation of general cargo, such as reefer 
containers and drilling tubular, both on deck (Sanaborg’s 
flush cargo deck providing a usable area of 425m
3) and 
within the hold. 
The twin IMSVs are ‘double acting’, meaning that they 
can break through ice whilst sailing in both ahead and 
astern conditions. In ahead mode, Sanaborg can obtain a 
speed of 4knots in 0.6m level ice, and astern navigation 
sees the vessel capable of clearing over 30,000m
3 of rafted 
and rubble ice within an hour. These capabilities are 
attributed to the IMSV’s specially designed aft hull form, 
and the incorporation of two Wärtisilä Icepod propellers, 
tailor made for this project, with design input from 
operator Wagenborg Offshore, both of which are Polar-
classed and possess azimuthing qualities. 
Sanaborg’s propulsive arrangement grants the vessel the 
ability to operate at 12.5knots at maximum draught and 
at 13.3knots at a design draught of 75% MCR. Bollard 
pull has been recorded at 36tonnes when operating in 
2.5m draught conditions. Each IMSV has a deadweight 
of 969tonnes at a maximum draught of 3.15m and 
417tonnes at 2.5m design draught. Additionally, each 
vessel incorporates a citadel design, to safeguard crew 
against the potential effects of gas cloud formation –
particularly when the vessel is carrying substances such as 
hydrogen sulphide (H2S) or methane (CH4). The citadel 
arrangement includes plugs for breathing apparatus at the 
entrance to the crew accommodation on the aft deck, as 
well as the mess area and wheelhouse, and, in the event of 
a gas cloud forming, crew can isolate the engine room.

elivered in tandem with sister ship, Signet Stars 
& Stripes, Signet Constellation was designed to 
the specifications of Canadian builder Robert 
Allan’s RAstar 3100 class. The 30.48m vessel has 
been constructed to provide marine support services 
– including escort tug duties and emergency towing 
operations – to Angola LNG Supply Services’ 
(ALSS) operations in the Port of Pascagoula, 
Mississippi, US. And, should the duo’s name seem a 
tad familiar to any sailing buffs, the vessels were 
named after past America’s Cup winners; the 12m 
yachts Constellation, which scooped the prize in 
1964, and Stars & Stripes, which won in 1987. 
Propulsion consists of a pair of EPA Tier 
3-compliant CAT C1715-16 diesel engines, each 
generating 2,550kW at 1,800rpm and driving a 
Rolls-Royce model US 255 drive, with 2,800mm 
diameter controllable pitch propellers in Kort 
nozzles through a composite shafting system. 
During sea trials, it was demonstrated that this 
arrangement granted the vessel a bollard pull of 
81tonnes ahead, and a free running speed of 
13.5knots. 
Each vessel features a main hawser winch, which is 
a dual drum Markey Model DESDF-48, rated 
147kW, while the aft deck has been equipped with a 
96tonne SWL towpost, for resilience when it comes 
to emergency towing operations. Onboard electrical 
power, meanwhile, is provided courtesy of three 
Northern Lights M1066 generator sets, rated at 
99kW @1,800rpm, all connected in parallel. 
Signet Constellation has been equipped with a pair 
of Fire Fighting Systems’ (FFS’) SFP 250x350 
pumps, fed by the main engines, and the firefighting 
monitors, FFS 1200LBs, are each capable of 
delivering water at a rate of 48,050litres per minute, 
with a range of 122m. The vessel can carry up to six 
crew members and features the capacity to 
accommodate up to 281,000litres of fuel oil, 
16,366litres of fresh water and 1,364litres of  
waste oil.

escribed by shipbuilder Damen as a ‘silent research 
vessel’, the 36m loa Simon Stevin was designed 
jointly by Damen and VLIZ, the Flemish Institute for 
the Sea, for the purpose of undertaking offshore 
scientific research on climate change, sustainable fishing 
and energy production at sea, as well as for other 
educational purposes. The vessel is operating in the 
North Sea. 
To comply with requirements regarding its footprint 
and fishing gear, the layout of the research vessel was 
optimised to boast low underwater noise levels, and 
particularly to be able to sail in silent mode – this latter 
factor placing the vessel in compliance with the 
International Council for Exploration of the Seas 
(ICES) Standard 209. According to Damen, Simon 
Stevin is the smallest vessel built to date to successfully 
meet this ICES standard. Noise reduction was partly 
attained by flexibly mounting the vessel’s two 520kW 
electric motors. When operating in silent mode, Simon 
Stevin has demonstrated a sail speed of up to 9.5knots. 
Onboard, the scientists can rely on both a dry and 
wet laboratory for their research, both of which are 
located on the main deck. A survey room, containing 
computers and servers, has been positioned on the 
forecastle deck. Damen says that, when the net drum is 
dismantled, the aft deck offers room for additional 
containerised laboratories. In total, the vessel can 
accommodate 10 crew and 10 scientists on overnight 
missions or research trips spanning a few days, but is 
suited to carrying up to 30 persons on day-trips. 
The vessel features a tiltable A-frame on the aft deck, 
coupled with winches for hydrographical survey work. 
Free deck space has been measured at 45m
2, allowing 
for two containers to be stored. The vessel has also 
been equipped with a number of varying fishing 
winches, installed below deck. Onboard capacities 
include 45m
3 of fuel oil, 14m
3 of potable water and 
20m
3 of ballast water.

T
he 26m Suffolk Spirit has achieved a number of 
‘firsts’, in its conception, at the newbuilding stage 
and, ultimately, in its delivery in July last year. As the 
opener in Macduff Ship Design’s Multi Mac multi-
purpose workboat concept, the vessel is intended to 
carry out basic functions such as towing and pushing, 
anchor handling, mooring and supply, as well as to 
provide more specialised services, including diving / 
civil engineering support, dredging services, pipe and 
hose handling operations, buoy maintenance and 
pollution control tasks. Additionally, the vessel has the 
potential to be utilised as an offshore wind farm 
support vessel. 
According to Macduff, Suffolk Spirit is the largest 
multi-purpose craft that the designer has worked on, 
to date, and one of the largest of its types to grace UK 
waters. Donald Cameron, Macduff managing 
director, tells Significant Small Ships: “Many of the 
existing foreign designs in the marketplace were 
originally designed for operation in inland waters…
[so] it was considered that a new, purpose-designed 
range of vessels could offer superior sea-keeping 
qualities, improved performance and more 
economical operating costs.”
Another unusual detail, and another first for both 
Macduff and Ipswich, UK-based Kocurek Marine, a 
relative newcomer to the boatbuilding scene, is the fact 
that the Multi Mac was physically constructed 12miles 
from the nearest suitable launching area. The fact 
Kocurek’s fabricating workshops are located at such a 
significant distance from the coast meant that the 
builder had to collaborate with Macduff, throughout 
the project, to gradually develop the vessel in a series of 
individual ‘units’. This process necessitated the 
creation of a split down Suffolk Spirit’s centre line, in 
order to ensure that both halves could be legally and 
safety carried by road, within the maximum allowable 
transportable size. 
Powered by a pair of Doosan engines, generating a 
combined output of nearly 1,200kW, Suffolk Spirit is 
capable of achieving a service speed of 10.5knots and a 
bollard pull ranking of 23tonnes. The vessel was 
designed to be able to accommodate 62.5tonnes worth 
on cargo on deck, and has the capacity to handle 
90,000litres of fuel oil, 34,000litres of fresh water and 
43,000litres of water ballast. With the UK Maritime 
and Coastguard Agency (MCA) having delivered its 
stamp of approval, the vessel was launched in April 
2012 and delivered, three months later, to Shire 
Maritime, which has been putting the vessel through 
its paces, on the east coast of England, ever since. 
Although Macduff has no plans, as yet, to follow up 
with a sister vessel for Suffolk Spirit, the Multi Mac 
concept has attracted some subsequent interest from 
the marine sector; the designer has been contracted to 
put together a 36.5m version of the concept, for the 
Port of London Authority, which is currently under 
construction at Manor Marine in Portland. Meanwhile, 
keeping the UK boatbuilding sector busy, Humber 
Workboats has confirmed that it will build a smaller, 
18.45m Multi Mac.

A
t present, only 17% of the known oil and gas fields 
within the Arctic territories are undergoing some 
form of development, not accounting for the 
unexplored, gargantuan stretch of northern Russian 
coastline, nor the zones off the coasts of Greenland, 
Alaska and the northern Norwegian islands. However, 
Arctic oil and gas exploration is widely expected to 
take off in earnest in 2015, granting companies a short 
window in which to put together ice-breaking vessels 
capable of handling the harsh Arctic climes.
As one would expect in this location, safety 
considerations are paramount; with temperatures 
plunging to below -30
oC, and the nearest potential 
rescue vessel being located 12-24 hours away, an 
accident in Arctic conditions could easily lead to 
injuries and fatalities. Energy majors are therefore 
investing not only in the offshore technology to exploit 
the region’s oil and gas resources, but also the support 
craft to assist workers in the event of an emergency. 
In December 2012, Arctech Helsinki Shipyard 
successfully launched its latest offshore rescue vessel 
Vitus Bering, originally monikered NB-506, which 
was ordered as part of a two-vessel deal by Russian 
shipping corporation Sovcomflot. 
Following delivery to Sovcomflot, the vessel  has 
been deployed in the Arktunun-Dagi oil and gas 
field, situated in the Sakhalin area, off Russia’s eastern 
coast, where its duties include: providing supplies to 
the gas production platform; firefighting 
responsibilities; oil spill response;  protecting this 
structure from ice; and providing general rescue 
services for the workers on the platform. 
Vitus Bering features a length of 99.9m and a 
breadth of 21.7m, and has been designed to operate 
in thick drifting ice conditions, in temperatures 
plunging to -35
oC. In addition, the vessel is able to 
operate independently in ice thicknesses of 1.7m. 
Fitted with four Wärtsilä engines, producing a 
combined engine power output of 18,000kW, the 
vessel’s rescue capacity is for 195 persons. 
Cranes and cargo equipment have mainly been 
supplied by Rolls-Royce, provider of the vessel’s TW 
1000H, 100tonne-capacity towing winch, and 
Melcal Marine. In total, the vessel has a diesel 
capacity of 500m
3, and, when it comes to firefighting, 
the vessel can rely on a total monitor discharge 
capacity of 2,400m
3 per hour. 
No sooner had NB-506 been launched than the 
keel-laying for NB-507 commenced. The first block, 
comprising 260tonnes, consists of the vessel’s pump 
room and bottom and side tanks. Arctech Helsinki is 
working in cooperation with Russia’s Vyborg 
Shipyard, which is piecing together 20 blocks for the 
project. 
Delivery for NB-507 is scheduled for April 2013, 
and, according to Arctech Helsinki managing director 
Eski Mustamäki: “Our third project, the building of 
another icebreaking rescue vessel, has started at 
Yantar Shipyard in Kalingrad. The hull will be 
shipped to Helsinki for outfitting and finalising 
works in Spring 2013."

V
roon 1 is the first in a seven-strong series of daughter craft 
rigid inflatable boats (RIBs), ordered by Vroon Offshore 
Services (VOS), which requires these small craft to be 
operated from its next generation emergency response and 
rescue vessel (ERRV) mother vessels, currently on build in 
Nanjing, China. 
Based on Delta’s long-running Phantom model, these new 
daughter craft RIBs had to satisfy Bureau Veritas (BV), the 
UK MCA and Vroon, and so they underwent a series of 
stringent functional and operational safety tests. The first 
craft, Vroon 1, comfortably achieved a top speed of 34knots 
with seven people on board. 
The seven daughter craft RIBs are 10m loa, 3.36m wide 
and draw 0.71m. Combined weight (including 430litres of 
fuel, three crew  members and nine survivors – each survivor 
being allocated a weight allowance of 85kg) comes in at 
7.78tonnes. Twin Yanmar 6BY-240 engines power the craft 
via twin Hamilton HJ241 waterjets.
The first two vessels have been successfully transported to 
China for further testing and synchronising of specialist 
equipment fitted on the mother vessels. Then, when all 
deliveries have been completed in China and the UK, all the 
vessels will be reunited in UK waters prior to joining Vroon's 
fleet of ERRVs in the North Sea.
In addition to the current class and statutory requirements 
for this type of craft, VOS also required additional safety 
features based on its extensive operational experience. These 
include allowing for an increased manning weight of 85kg 
per person, rather than its previous recommendation of 75kg 
per person. 
VOS also specified waterjet drives for increased safety and 
manoeuvrability, and the craft feature single-point lift 
couplings, with a davit docking interface, and a newly 
designed solid buoyant fendering system.  This is constructed 
using polyurethane-coated, closed cell foam sections that 
ensure the fender will not absorb or hold any seawater, and 
which also allows individual sections to be changed should 
they become damaged in the line of duty.

D
elivered, to the day, precisely a year after the original 
contract signing – and two weeks ahead of schedule – 
the 19.4m loa WARNEMÜNDE begins 2013 operated by 
Rostock-based Lottsbetrieb, on behalf of Wasser- und 
Schifffahrtsdirektion Nordwest (the Water and Shipping 
Directorate, Northwest) at JadeWeserPort, the container 
terminal situated just outside Wilhelmshaven, Germany, 
which was opened in September 2012 and which features a 
natural water depth of more than 18m. 
Constructed in aluminium, the pilot boat’s design is based 
on a series of 17m boats which were originally delivered by 
Swedish shipbuilder Dockstavarvet to the Kiel Canal Pilots, 
between 2010 and 2011. Building on this example, 
WARNEMÜNDE features an extended hull design, with a 
waterline length of 18.5m. Given JadeWeserPort’s deepwater 
surroundings, the yard was instructed to ensure that the hull 
featured a fine entry, to provide “a maximum of 0.95g at the 
steering position at 25knots in 2.5m waves.” As one might 
expect, given these specifications, and with safety in mind, 
the vessel has been designed to be self-righting in all 
conditions, regardless of load.
The arrangement sees the wheelhouse raised and given 
round-the-horizon visibility for two crew and one pilot. A 
saloon, with two berths, is situated aft of the wheelhouse at 
deck level and features a toilet, crew mess and seating for up 
to seven pilots. The entire deckhouse has been resiliently 
mounted, to keep noise levels below the 65dBA mark when 
the vessel is operating at 90% MCR. Ergonomic, tailor-
made seating in the wheelhouse was supplied by Recaro 
Maritime. 
Crew comfort was a major factor in WARNEMÜNDE’s 
design; given the conditions in which the boat will be 
operating in Winter, it was deemed important to heat up not 
only the interior sections, but also the deck areas, boarding 
platforms and exterior handrails. The vessel’s heating is 
provided by two main sources: a 45kW Kabola boiler, in 
combination with waste heat drawn from the main engines’ 
fresh water circuits. Additionally, a 12kW Perkins / Stamford 
diesel generator supplies the vessel’s electrical system and 
feeds five large heated windows, for unrestricted visibility. 
The navigation and communications package comprises a 
system delivery from Furuno.
WARNEMÜNDE is powered by twin Volvo Penta D16 
main engines, driving fixed pitch propellers through 80mm 
stainless steel shafts. Speed at a displacement of 34tonnes has 
been recorded at 25knots, resulting in an estimated fuel 
consumption rate of 7.5litres per nautical mile.

ormally launched and delivered in May 2012, 
at the Seawork exhibition in Southampton, UK 
– an event that has grown to become one of 
Europe’s most relevant shows for small boat 
business – the 17.5m loa Wildcat 3 not only 
represents a new model for offshore wind farm 
support catamarans, as first-in-series in the Blyth 
17m class, but also constitutes the largest boat that 
Essex-based Blyth Workcats has constructed to 
date, with the builder having pushed its facility to 
its utmost capacity. 
Featuring a 6.1m beam and a 1.3m draught, the 
glass-reinforced plastic workboat cat utilises twin 
MAN Diesel D2848 engines, rated at 552kW 
apiece, and five-bladed propellers, supplied by UK 
manufacturer Clements Marine, to generate a 
cruising speed of approximately 20knots and a top 
speed of 25knots, with the capacity to 
accommodate up to 12 passengers, two crew 
members and 6tonnes of cargo. To facilitate its 
work in offshore wind farm support, the vessel’s 
forward working deck has an area spanning 40m
2, 
while aft deck space comes to 15m
2.
The vessel’s displacement is 25tonnes in lightship 
mode, and approximately 32tonnes when fully 
loaded, and total fuel capacity aboard Wildcat 3 is 
just over 6,300litres. During the cat’s maiden 
voyage, from Canvey Island, Essex, to the Seawork 
show – a journey which necessitated navigation of 
the south-eastern English coast – the MAN Diesel 
engines were demonstrated to burn 75litres per hour 
when cruising at 19-20knots, and 127litres per hour 
at 26-30knots. 
For enhanced onboard comfort, KAB full 
suspension seats have been installed in the passenger 
seat area, and amenities include a galley sink, fridge, 
microwave oven and 10 passenger laptop points. 
At the time of delivery, Blyth Workcats owner 
Edward Tuite commented: “Our GRP hulls are 
extremely strong and keep their looks for many 
years. This is important for users in service sectors 
such as passenger transport or dive or angling 
charter. A smart appearance can be important for a 
business and with GRP any knocks or scrapes can 
be quickly repaired so the boat always looks well 
maintained and seaworthy. The lower purchase 
price of GRP boats also benefits customers by 
helping their budgets to go further, [so] they can 
afford to invest in the more comfortable interior 
fittings and higher quality bridge technology that 
can help to attract more business.” 
According to Blyth Workcats, bespoke versions 
of the Blyth 17m class could also be supplied with 
Rolls-Royce waterjets, as an alternative propulsive 
arrangement, and plans are afoot to create a 
number of unique, spin-off designs from the Blyth 
17m-type template. One concept would maintain 
the 17m hull but feature a different layout for the 
deck and wheelhouse, enabling the vessel to 
accommodate up to 106 internally seated 
passengers. Additionally, the tank area features the 
space to incorporate more fuel tanks, should these 
be required for longer journeys or extended periods 
of vessel operation.

B
uilt to the specifications of Mobimar’s 18 Wind 
class, this first-in-series offshore wind farm transfer 
vessel has been developed specifically to confront some 
of the challenges associated with the next generation 
of offshore wind turbine arrays, particularly those 
situated further from shore, and in deeper waters, than 
ever before. 
With this in mind, the 12-passenger vessel has been 
classified to sea state Hs4, with embarkation / 
disembarkation possible in significant wave heights of 
up to Hs2.5m. The vessel deploys a trimaran hull 
design and a specially developed ‘gripper system’, 
which enables the pilot to approach the wind turbine 
from any side, attach one hydraulic gripper arm to the 
turbine, and then turn the vessel straight in front of 
the boat landing protection pipes. This 180degs 
approaching angle enables the pilot to select the most 
convenient direction at the turbine, in tandem with 
the prevailing wind and tidal circumstances.
Wind Servant’s trimaran hull characteristics also mean 
that the impact exerted on the landed platform is kept 
to a minimum,with the hydraulics keeping this platform 
in position. The engine can idle during the landing, 
while the gripper is either in gripping or sliding mode, 
which also makes it easier and safer for turbine 
technicians to effect underwater maintenance tasks.
Wind Servant has also been designed to result in lower 
fuel consumption and, therefore, lower operational costs 
than the majority of conventional crew / technician 
transfer vessels. This is partly achieved by the inclusion 
of twin Rolls-Royce / Volvo Penta waterjets, which, in 
addition to easing the strain on the main engine’s power 
output requirement, provide an additional layer of 
redundancy in the case of engine failure. 
Internally, the accommodation cockpit and 
wheelhouse are spacious, due to the trimaran hull 
characteristics, and, with comfortable technician 
transit in mind, noise levels have been minimised; a 
top end of 67dBA has been measured in the 
accommodation space, while sea trials demonstrated 
that the bridge area noise level was less than 64dBA. 
Additionally, shock-absorbed seating is intended to 
increase passenger safety and reduce incidents of 
seasickness, a serious condition that can potentially 
lead to later accidents at the offshore wind turbines. 
As an extra safety feature, Wind Servant’s large roof 
windows allow the pilot to keep an eye on any cargo, 
equipment or essential parts that are being lifted from 
the deck to the turbine, via a Fassi crane, as well as on 
disembarked technicians who are climbing up the 
turbine ladders. Wind Servant certainly seems ready to 
take crew transfer into deeper territories.
