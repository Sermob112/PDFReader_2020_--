REMOY VIKING: unique 
triple-rig shrimp trawler 
Norwegian operator Jack Remoy look delivery of the world's first large triple-rig 
shrimp tnmler, Remoy Viking, in the latter months of 2000* The vessel, whose fishing 
gear system has been described as unique, was built in Denmark ;ii Orskuv Chrislunscns 
SkihsvaerCl tu si Norwegian design t'rum 
Ulstein Nordvestconsult 
Measuring frl.DOm x !4.65in. the vessel 
is powered by a WiirlsiUi S,52OkW main 
engine, which is coupled to a 3t8OOmm 
diameter CP U!slein propeller. Ulstein also 
supplied the rudder, steering gear and a 
400kW bovvthnistcr, The vessel has a top 
speed of 17 knots. 
The shrimp processing plant, supplied by 
Danish company Caraitech, would be 
deemed advanced on a much bigger ship but 
for a vessel of iliis size definitely sets the 
trawler apart from the norm. Highlights 
include a new style separator which sorts the 
COtch as it comes from the pounds and delivers 
clean shrimp straight into the processing line. 
After passing through a receiving lank, the 
shrimp go through three graders where they 
are automatically sorted by seven sizes in 
preparation for different processing modes. 
Two grades of shrimp can then be cooked 
simultaneously in u double batch cooker 
before storage in holding tanks, AM shrimp 
then pass on u> an inspection belt before being 
packed. 
The 800m3capacity fishroom is positioned 
in the centre of the vessel adjacent to the 
2CK)ni' packing hold. 
The winch arrangement for Remoy Viking 
is largely from Rolls-Royce Ulstein Brattvaag 
with 'helper' winches supplied by Kinde & 
Toft, Nets were provided by Cosmos Trawl. 
The main deck has four trawl lanes extending 
the full length of the vessel, with eight 17-
tonne sweepline winches, allowing lour 
trawls to be ready for use at any lime. 
Four 45-tonne trawl winches with 47m/ 
min handling capacity are positioned un the 
upper deck and controlled by means of a 
Synchro system from Rolls-Royce Brattvaag. 
Two hydraulic deck cranes - one of 6t/12m 
reach and another of 2t/8m reach - supplied 
by Dreggen Crane, are mounted lo starboard 
and at the stern. 
Wheel house electronics are fairly 
comprehensive and include a full GMDSS 
SatconvC installation, Navtex and extensive 
VHFs.

VILHELMTHORSTEINSSON: 
Iceland's 'biggest' fishes for 
varied species 
An advanced 7()m x ttim stem trawler/purse seiner. Vilhcini Thorsteinsson, became the 
largest vessel in the Icelandic Heel when delivered in September 2000. Designed by Vik 
Sandvik and built at Steven Veri't in Norwaj <>n a bull completed at Northern Shipyard, 
Poland, the vessel is Titled out with the most up to dale trawl gear to enable it to fish for 
a wide variety of species. 
Able to take advantage offish quotas that 
have not as yet been restricted in Icelandic 
waters. Vilhclm Thorsteinsson is equipped 
in catch shrimp, pelagic and bottom Fish. Us 
Icelandic owners. Samherji hf, have installed 
an extensive onboard processing factory, 
largely aimed at increasing turn-a round lime 
for its blue whiting catches. 
Hampidjan of Reykjavik. Iceland, 
supplied the ship with its patented Gloria 
2,048m circumference self-spreading trawl. 
which is claimed to lower fuel costs and boost 
fishing performance. This is complemented 
by a set of Poly-lee Super Foil mid-water 
irawl doors of FLS 13 type, manufactured 
from exceptionally strong steel but of special 
light const ruction for shallow water fishing. 
Careful thought was given to the fish 
handling system which consists of Tendos 
processing lines and vacuum system; a 74 
lonne/24-hour slurry ice system from Frost 
of Iceland and an MMC Fodema freezing 
arrangement The latter includes seven MMC 
plate freezers with a total capacity of 100 
tonnes per 24 hours. 
Whelm Thorsteinsson is powered by a 
Wiirtsila 12V32 main diesel of 5,520kW. 
This drives a Wiirtsila CP100 propeller of 
3,800mm diameter via a Wartsila SCV 95-
P58 reduction gear. The propeller turns in an 
FN 3800/50 nozzle, also from Warisila. It 
also has two Brunvoll ihrusters - a 650kW 
FU-63-LTC-1550 unit filled forward and an 
FU-63-LTC-1750 unit of 735kW. Top speed 
is an impressive 18.3 knots and bollard pull. 
90 tonnes. 
Electrical power is generated by an ABB 
AMCi 560 L6 shaft generator of 2,500kW, 
two Mitsubishi auxiliary engines (an MAS 
1330 Of I.O'JIkW and an MAS 580 of 
544kW) and a Mitsubishi MAS 95 
emergency generator of 84kW. 
Mosl of the purse-trawler's navigation and 
fish-rinding equipment is from Furuno 
although Simrad supplied an FS-925/903 
trawl sonar system. Furuno kit includes: an 
FAR-2835S S-band radar; FR-2115 X-band 
radar; FSV-24 sonar; FCV-IO. FCD-1500 
and FCV-1200 echo sounders: a C1-60G 
Doppler log; and A-3 GMDSS. 
The owners opted for deck machinery 
from two manufacturers-Triplex and Rapp. 
The Triplex outfit includes: an 85Q/500/2S 
30-tonne net hauler: NK-7500 six-tonne net 
stacker crane; KN-50 four-tonne deck crane; 
and KN-30 2.5-tonne fish pump crane, 
Rapp provided an extensive set oi' 
winches including: three TWS-22060 58-
tonne trawl winches; four SW-250G 18-
tonnc sweepline winches; two GW-2500 
18-tonne gUson winches: two GW-2000 
10-lonne outhaul winches; and a GW-2500 
codend winch. 
The vessel has sis single berth cabins and 
eleven double berth cabins to accommodate 
a crew of up to 2S.

ATLANTIC CHALLENGE: 
downsized ship calls for 
innovative thinking 
The MMWm x 14.5m mid-water pelagic trawler Atlantic Challenge boasls a wealth of 
innovative concepts and improved traditional systems. Owned by Marlin Howie; and 
partners of Rfllybegs, Ireland, (lie vessel was built in Norway at AS Eidsvik on a hull 
completed in December 1998 at Northern Shipyard. Gdansk, Poland. The ship is of 
Vik Sand vik design ami fishes primarily for mackerel and blue whiting. 
Much of the innovation lies in the onboard 
Hydema, as is a wide selection of oilier 
pumping and refrigeration systems devised 
to protect both crew and fish when pelagic 
hays arc hauled alongside in rough seas. The 
vessel is believed to be the first of its size to 
be specifically designed for a stern pumping 
operation and has winches and cranes 
arranged aff lor the purpose. 
In order to adopt astern pumping system, 
ihe yard modified a I6inch Rapp fish pump 
by extending the hydraulic pipe and fisli hose 
forward. In this way the pump can be lifted 
into the trawl as opposed to being connected 
to the codend. Pish are pumped over Ihe stern 
and immediately transferred lo refrigerated 
sea water tanks. 
A total often such tanks - each containing 
fast-chilling shiny ice - are positioned close to 
ihe ship's sides, an innovation which is claimed 
to aid vessel stability. The tanks, fitted with 
modern ozone technology lor cleanliness, range 
from a central corridor All piping is hidden 
underfoot and branches off to each tank. 
The traditional method of manually 
regulating tank water How via valves has been 
replaced by a PC-based system remotely 
operated from the wheelhotise. 
Power is by means of a Wartsila Propac 
installation driving Wichmatie propeller and 
sterngear and BrunvoL side thrusters. 
Both trawl winches, each of which pulls a 
maximum of 67.5 tons, are from Rapp 
winching equipment. Deck cranes were 
supplied by Triplex. 
The wheelhouse is dominated by Furuno 
electronics bttl also includes Kaijo Denki 
sonars, JRC and Simrad echo sounders and 
six catch sensors from Marport of Iceland. 
Atlantic Challenge replaces a 70m vessel 
of the same name, which was also built in 
Norway. The owners sold their original ship 
when fishing quotas were cut and its large 
refrigerated lank capacity exceeded their 
needs. The shallower draft of the replacement 
vessel also facilitates sailing in and out of the 
base port,

AJAX: powerful escort tug 
at work off Norway 
The most powerful dedicated tanker escorting in Europe and one of the most powerful 
vessels of Its type in the world, entered service off the west coast of Norway towards 
(lie end of 2(K)0. Named Ajux, the newest (uj> in the Oslesjo Rcderi Meet, measures 
41.60m \ [5,90m x 6.80m, has ;i bollard pull of 95 tonnes and supports a sustained 
escori steering force of 160 tonnes at 10 knots. 
4/ojrwas built by Astilleros Zamakona of 
the model testa indicated that the lines at both 
Bilbao, Spain, in accordance with DNV 
regulations as an escori tug with FiFil and 
Oil Recovery certification and fully complies 
with Mil-
regulations of the Norwegian 
Maritime Directorate. 
Designed by Roberl Allan Ltd, naval 
architects of Vancouver. Canada, in extensive 
consultation with the owner, and in particular 
with Carl Johan Amundsen, of C 
J Amundsen 
AS, the ing incorporates a number of unique 
hullform developments -
the result of a 
comprehensive series of model tests and 
research carried out by Roberl Allan over the 
past several years into the performance of 
escort tugs. Model tests were conducted at 
the Institute of Marine Dynamics in St. 
John's, Newfoundland and at Voith 
SchilTsieciinik's laboratories in Heidenheim, 
Germany to verify the predicted performance, 
and to refine the design of the hull and 
appendages. 
The tug is configured to operate in the 'skeg 
first" direction for all escort operations, but 
the hullform has been refined for best 
possible sea-keeping capabilities in both 
directions. The 'aft' end includes a raised 
forecastle and is the direction used for running 
Iree at sea in more severe sea stales, and for 
any rescue or long distance lowing. However. 
ends offer Q very dry working deck 
environment in up to nni significant seas. 
Power is derived from a pair of Caterpillar 
3612 diesel engines, each delivering 3,8O0kW 
at9Q0rev/tnin to a Voith cycloidal propeller, 
mode! 36GH-270 via a Voith Turbo coupling. 
Both main engines also drive a fire-fighting 
pump and a hydraulic pump via a PTO and 
step-up gear ;it the forward end. Electrical 
power is supplied by a pair of Caterpillar 
33O6B diesel generator sels. each rated 
165kWat 1.500 rev/min. 
The tug has a split-level accommodation 
and service space, orientated about the major 
forward working deck. The main deck area 
features a fully enclosed winch room, with a 
double-drum Karmoy winch, containing a 
250m x 90mm Superline Steelite Xtra HMPE 
escort lowing hawser and a 1,200m x 64 mm 
steel towline. Adjacent to the winch room is 
a huge "garage1, containing an oil spill 
recovery skimmer and oil containment boom 
on a common bed frame. A large Bffer model 
K0-000-3SL knuckle-boom crane serves to 
launch and recover this equipment as well as 
handle deck equipment and stores. 
There is a wet lobby thai accesses the crew 
accommodation from the main deck. The 
lower deck has seven well-appointed, 
spacious single cabins, and a crew exercise 
room, all situated around a central service 
and storage core. The upper level includes 
the master's cabin, galley, galley store and 
roomy crew lounge and mess areas. At the 
boat deck level (here is a large office/command 
centre from which any emergency response 
operations would be conducted. The entire 
accommodation lining and outfitting system, 
including a floating floor system was supplied 
and installed by Maritime .Vloniering AS of 
Bygstad, Norway. Noise levels in all 
accommodation areas were measured on trials 
at between 59 and 65 dBA under full power. 
The wheelhouse is fully appointed with 
the latest in electronic control and navigation 
systems for operation of ;i tug with ;i fully 
automated machinery space, and includes two 
separate Voith steering and control consoles, 
one forward and one aft for maximum 
operational visibility and control when 
operating in either direction.

The two Voith tractor tiif;s EnscHni and i'ahniei, delivered in the second quarter of 
2000, were significant in two ways. Firstly, they added highly efficient modern tonnage 
to the Heel of customer and operator Portnel and also they marked a return to

The whcclhouse is dominated by the Voith 
operating console although the steering and 
pitch control stands have been redesigned to 
allow the Master to move his seat between 
the consoles so as to face either forward or 
aft during operations. The port stand is for 
steering and engine control whilst Ihe 
starboard stand is for pitch and towing winch 
control. Fire monitor operation is via a 
portable control box that enables the watch 
keeper to observe the fire from any position 
on die bridge deck. The new layout has 
greatly improved operability and reduced 
crew fatigue. 
Layout of the working decks is 
functional and clean. The boat deck 
(above the accommodation) houses 
a boat lender davit, Ihe fire-figfuing

BUNBURY Class: first of six 
for operation down under 
Although subjected to a troubled build programme, the first of a series of six reverse 
tractor togs entered service in 2000 with Australian operator Adsteam Marine. First of 
class. Bunbury, was loosely based on an old proven Adsteam tag design from Barnes 
& Fleck, an Australian firm which was asked to update and enhance its concept for (he 
new series. 
Various modifications were made. In order 
to improve directional stability and water flow 
to the propulsion units, the beam was 
increased and the skeg profile altered (<> run 
almost the full length of the keel, at a height 
of 0.5m, The changes shifted the centre of 
pressure forward to give improved static 
bollard pull and enhance indirect pull above 
eight knots. A thickened flat sheer strake 
without the traditional sponson was also 
incorporated and fitted with a 1,000mm 
Sliibala fender forward and Trelleborg block 
fenders aft. Particular attention was paid at 
design stage to reducing noise and vibration 
levels to between 64 and 75 dB(A), 
A speed of 12.5 knots and bollard pull of 
f>0 tonnes is derived from a Daihalsu/ 
Aquamaster power/propulsion package.

control drives. Auxiliary power is provided 
by two Caterpillar 3304DIT diesel powered 
gen sets, delivering a total of 170k\V at 1,500 
rev/min. The main machinery is cooled by 
four NRF type U1425 box coolers. 
Featuring good all-round visibility thanks 
to a high rise wheelhouse with raked 
windows and low squat funnels, Bunbury 
has been carefully designed for a small crew. 
The captain and chief engineer both have 
double cabins at the forward end of the 
deckhouse, ahead of the mess, and three twin-
berth crew cabins are positioned forward 
below main deck. The mess area includes a 
separate galley, two washrooms and a 
laundry. 
The wheelhouse is accessed via two sets of 
internal stairs. Compact and efficiently laid out, 
it has a horseshoe shaped control console 
forward. Individual throttles and steering 
controls are complemented by Aquamaster's 
recently developed Aquaduo single joystick 
control system. Electronics include a Simrad 
Robertson autopilot. Simrad combined GPS/ 
echosounder. Koden radar and GMDSS pack. 
Rolls-Royce Ulslein Bralivaag single split

ABEILLE FECAMP: reverse 
tractor packs plenty of punch 
The ilccisitm to upgrade its fleet of Duiikerque Clairvoyant class tugs for reverse 
tractors prompted French operator LesAbcilles to order 14 vessels of different types in 
99/00 from (lie Alsfom Leroux Naval yard in Si Malo, France. The largest models arc 
a quartet for the port of I,e Havre - Abeille Fecamp and i(s sisters have large stern-
mounted thrusters and achieve an impressive bollard pull of 60 tonnes. Three of the 
tu»s are identical, (lie fourth - (he second in the series - being larger and equipped 
differently for ocean-going capability. 
Design uspeeis were influenced by the climate 
in which die tugs operate and also by the 
builder's need fora flexible layout, which coukl 
be adapted lor vessels of different lengths. 
Length at 36.80m and displacement (845 
tons at full load) were determined by the 
V ariab 
1 e winter sea s t ;i 1 c conditions 
encountered between Lc Havre and the 
Antifer oil terminal, two hours north. The 
bull comprises a cylindrical mid-section that 
enables the builder to offer any length 
between 33m and 40m and. hence, also 
customise the interior. This option was put to 
the test for the second Les Abeilles tug, 
Abeille Cascogne, which has two additional 
three-berth cabins forward of the engine room 
to accommodate extra crew on deep sea 
operations. 
As standard, the lugs have a full width 
galley/mess and two single crew cabins at 
main deck level and three single berth cabins 
on the 'Captain Deck". Each has a separate 
toilei compartment. 
All four vessels have identical propulsion 
systems. Power is derived from twin ABC 
8DZC diesels with a total output of 3.680k\V 
at 1.000 rev/min. These turn Aquamaster US 
3001 thrusters with 2,600mm propellers via 
Twin Disc MCD 
3000 slipping clutches. Free 
running speed is approximately 12.5 knots. 
A Scholtel bow Minister of 200kW is also 
fitted, powered by hydraulic pumps that 
additionally serve the towing winch system, 
driven off the port main engines. 
The starboard engine drives the fire pump, 
which in the case of 
Abeille Fecamp and Abeille 
Guscogne comprises a 450m7hr system 
supplying a 300m Vhr single Fislicon monitor 
and a scl f-drenehing system. Vessels three and 
four, however, have been lilted with a Kvaemer 
fire-fighting system consisting of two 1.2fXJmY 
hr monitors and a drenching system fed by a 
pair of 1.400m Vlir main engine driven pumps. 
The raised forecastle deck is dominated 
by a double drum 135 tonnes brake AMGC 
anchor/cowing winch. The port drum is fitted 
with 100m of 52mm rope combined with 15m 
of 88mm nylon Sigmallex and 20m of44mm 
wire. The starboard line combines 300m of 
52mm rope with a similar end arrangement. 
Aft of the deckhouse on three of the tugs is a 
single drum winch of similar characteristics. 
which houses an identical rope/wire 
arrangement lo the forward starboard drum. 
Abeille Cascogne has a double drum AMGC 
winch aft capable of holding an extra 500m 
of52mra wire. 
All winches arc controlled from two 
consoles in the wheelhouse. These also 
incorporate controls for (he main engine and 
thrusterund house all navigation equipment 
such as the Sailor VHFs. Atlas 10UO colour

NORTH ATLANTIC PETREL: 
escort skeg improves tug 
performance 
Although at first glance identical (o fh&Attmtic Spruce class design from (he Canadian 
firm of Robert Allan Ltd, sister togs North Atlantic Petrel and North Atlantic Osprey 
incorporate an unusual 'escort skey', which has proved highly effective in enhancing 
towing operations. 
Owned by Newfoundland Marine Energy 
Lid and operated by Corning ;ii the Come-
by-Chance oil refinery in Newfoundland, the 
vessels undertake escort and tanker berthing 
duties in high winds and sen states. Robert 
.Allan Ltd amended the all-welded steel design 
to incorporate a skeg-shaped box keel from 
near the how to amidships. This effectively 
prevents any disturbance in the water How 
from affecting ihe stern-mounted thnister. 
Reports indicate lhat the desired purpose 
of the skeg in improving course stability in 
following seas and whi 1st carrying out 'over 
the bow' high-speed towing operations, has 
been highly successful. In indirect mode, a 
significant improvement in line pull is 
evident. The skeg has noi altered straight line 
performance and the new lugs have ihe same 
51 tonne bollard pull and 14 knots running 
speed as the other eight near identical vessels 
built at East Isle Shipyard on Prince Edward 
Island, Canada, since 1995. 
All ten tugs have the .same power package.

Wu & Associates of Singapore and built at the Yantui Rallies Zliifn [gland yard in 
Shandong Province, China, the vessel is now in the Singapore fleet of Jay a Holdings. 
Typical AHTS features include a raised 
forecastle and large 400nr clear deck area 
aft. Special, however, is an extra upper 
forecastle deck which, along with main deck 
space, gives generous room for a much higher 
level of accommodation than is the norm. 
Twelve single and four twin-berth cabins 
;ire apportioned to the crew whilst the captain 
and chief engineer benefit from suites atthe 
forward end of the upper deckhouse. 
Extensive mess facilities span the full width 
of the ship on the main deck and six single, 
one twin and one four-berth cabin arc

is powered by apair of WtrtsilH 
8R32 diescls, each developing 4.4(i()hp at 
750 rev/min. These arc coupled to 3,500m 
Wichmann CPpropellers turning inside Kurt 
nozzles to ensure a hoi lard pull of over 105 
tonnes and a maximum speed of 14 knots. 
Manoeuvrability is enhanced by identical 
electrically driven Kawasaki type KT-72B1 
bow and stern transverse thruslers. Each of 
these produces 5 !5kW at 1.450 rev/min and 
develops 8 tonnes of continuous thrust. 
Electrical power is supplied by two 770kW 
Leroy Somer shaft generators and a pair of 
300kW 340KDITA driven gen sets. A Perkins 
T4 236 powered emergency set of35k\V is

As would be expected, the vessel has 
powerful deck machinery. A 250-tonne 
double-drum waterfall towing/anchor 
handling Smatco winch, electro-hydrauh'cally 
driven by a dedicated GM 12V diesd engine. 
is housed in an enclosed winch room aft of 
the superstructure. The unit, which is 
remotely controlled from the whcelhouse, 
carries 1000m of 60mm diameter line on its 
upper drum and a similar length of 58mm 
line on (he lower. The first layer has a brake 
load capacity of 360 tonnes. 
Additional deck machinery comprises a 9-
ionne anchor windlass, two 10-tonne tugger 
winches and two 5-tonne capstans of Plimsoll 
manufacture. The same company supplied a 
300-tonne SWL hydraulic retractable shark 
jaw suitable for up to 3-inch wire or 3.5-inch 
chain and two sets of retractable low pins

knuckle boom crane and SOLAS approved 
rescue boat are also carried on deck. 
Kvaerner supplied the FiFil BV-clas.scd 
fire-fighting system. This has two 1,500m' 
pumps which feed two monitors mounted 
on a platform between the funnels and above 
ihe wheelhouse roof. Both monitors have a 
1,200m Vhr waler discharge capability with a 
120m throw length and one can deploy foam 
ai 300m Vhr from a 10m3 capacity tank. A 
25m1 A/cue emergency fire pump is also 
fitted. 
Extensive cargo carrying capacity is

HIGHLAND SCOUT: high 
spec OSV for worldwide 
markets 
In early 2000 Bender Shipbuilding of Mobile, Alabama, USA delivered a pair of 66.20m 
x 16.46m offshore vessels to Golf Offshore Marine, an affiliate of Gulfhiarb Offshore, 
with offshore operations in the North Sea, Singapore and Brazil. Highland Scout 
entered service in Brazil during mid-January and Highland Guide began work off 
Borneo some five weeks later. Conceptual design was a collaborative effort between 
the customer and builder with GuidoPerla and Associates of Seattle assisting with the 
final details. 
According lo Gene Leech, vice-president 
of operations for Gulf Offshore, these are 
not run-of-the-mill OSVs. "We have spent a 
few extra dollars lo give them some added 
dimension, with additional hardware, crew 
accommodation and certifications - as well 
as improved operational efficiencies -
lo 
increase our options in difficult international 
markets," he said. 
On their maiden voyages, the vessels 
averaged 12 knots from a power plant 
comprising two Caterpillar 3606 dicsels, each 
developing 2.320hp at 900 rcv/min. These 
turn 2.5m diameter four-bladed Berg CP 
propellers through Rcintjcs gearboxes having 
a 4:1 reduction ratio. Steering is by Becker-
style flap rudders assisted by Berg thruslers 
fore and aft. Both arc driven by dedicated 
Caterpillar engines - a l,254hp 3512 unit at 
the bow and a 570hp 3408C at the stern. 
Between the main engines, line abreast, 
arc three Caterpillar 3406C powered 
generators, each producing 250k\V at 1.800 
rev/min whilst a 105k\V emergency set, 
driven by a 33O4B. is located in the port aft 
corner of the superstructure on main deck 
level. Set lo start automatically within seven 
seconds of a power failure, it will provide 
sufficient power to run all the navigation 
equipment and olhercrucial systems. 
This deck also houses the galley, mess 
room, changing room, laundry and two crew 
cabins with a total of eight berths. Deck 1 
has a day room, three four-berth cabins and 
two with six berths. Captain and chief 
engineer have single staterooms up one more 
level alongside an additional two-berth cabin. 
Every cabin has private toilet/shower 
facilities. The pilothouse, which surrounds 
the single exhaust slack, is T-shaped in plan 
with control consoles fore and aft. 
The vessels have an extensive cargo 
carrying capacity. Five bulk mud tanks along 
the centreline hold 210m1 and these are 
Hanked by four liquid mud tanks each side to 
accommodate 639m \ Other tanks at the stern 
and bow, where they surround the bow 
thruster engine, have total capacities of 645m3 
of cargo fuel oil and 1 .OOOni' of fresh water. 
Some 1,200 tonnes o\' deck cargo can be 
carried, protected by over 1.2m of freeboard. 
Computer integrated pumping systems 
allow the chief engineer lo monitor tank levels 
and discharge from selected tanks without 
leaving his control .station. The vessel's entire 
1.600 ton below deck hold capacity can be 
discharged within six. hours, quadrupling the 
norm of 800 ions in 12 hours.

SAN RAFAEL: OSV for 
Mexican fields 
Vn unusually sophisticated offshore supply vessel entered service in the Mexican oil 
fields in the final quarter of 2000. Ordered by Nsiviem Tamaulis SA of Mexico, San 
Rafael, a 62.18m x 13.41m OSV was built at the Florida yard of Eastern Shipbuilding 
tn a design by Design Associates of \e\v Orleans. 
[■'or operations in the BabaiadeCampeche 
fields, tiff the eastern coast of Mexico, the 
ship is built id ABS Ocean Service 
classification and equipped with a dynamic 
positioning system and fire-fighting 
equipment. 
Of 
conventional OSV layout with forward 
superstructure and large aft deck space 
measuring 42.6m x 11.9m, the vessel is 
powered by a pair of Caterpillar 3516B 
diesels. each developing 2,000hp at 1,600 
rev/min. These turn 2.440mm diameter Bint 
Johnson foar-bladedstainless steel propellers 
through Reimjes WAF-862 gearboxes. The 
rudders of the high-Jill type are Tilled with 
fishtails and have 130 degrees of travel. 
Manoeuvring is. however, further enhanced 
by a 1,000hp Thrustmasler retractable bow 
thrnster with both azimuthing and tunnel 
operation. This is driven hydntulieally by a 
dedicated Cat 3508B diesel. Five additional 
Caterpillar units also power three generator 
sets and a pair of pump sets for the Wmr 
liquid mud tanks. In addition, six bulk mud 
tanks are provided and the vessel has 
extensive drill water, fuel, lube oil and potable 
water carrying capacity. Around 1.000 tonnes 
of deck cargo can also be carried. 
Arguably the most important item on the 
bridge is Ihe Kongsberg Simrad SDH) 
I 
dynamic positioning system with joystick. 
autopilot and two remote control stations. The 
DP is interfaced with a gyrocompass from 
the same manufacturer and two DGPS 
receivers, one by Northstarand the other from 
Ruytheon. This laller supplier is also 
responsible for two VHFs whilsl Furnno 
supplied the hulk o\' (he remainder of the 
electronics including two radar, an SSB radio. 
Area 3 GMDSS incorporating Inmarsat C 
with built-in GPS and depth meter. 
The single Svenska Skum lire monitor on 
the pilot house roof has a capacity of 6,600 
»alls/min and a throw of around 140m. A 
4.7m Zodiac RIB with a -lOhp outboard motor 
is carried and deployed by a Schat-1 larding 
davit. The vessel also has a small rnoonpool.

TEAM SALALAH: AHTS built 
from kit cut steel 
The lead vessel in a series of six, the 61.00m x 15.2m AHTS ship Team Salaiah is unique 
in many ways, most particularly because il bus been constructed from a sleel kit. 
Ordered by NICO International of Dubai 
in June 1998, the vessel was assembled at 
Adyard in Abu Dhabi to a Kvaerner Masa 
Marine (KMM) of Canada design utilising 
steel cut in the Netherlands. Delivery took 
place in March 2(100. Work has commenced 
on tfie second vessel. 
"flic decision to opt for a kit-build was 
based upon the customer's choice of yard. 
Adyard is essentially a repair and pressure 
tank fabrication facility and has little 
experience or equipment Tor a newbuild, It 
is, however, majority owned by NICO's 
parent company and was, therefore, selected 
on this basis. 
As simplification of the build process was 
essential, all double curvature plating was 
eliminated. Shipping was also taken into 
consideration. 
The 
steel 
supplier, 
CVnlraalstaal, shipped the fiat pre-formed 
components for each of the hull units and 
thus tailored dimensions to suii the size of 
shipping containers. The deckhouse was 
fabricated and outfitted in advance of the hull 
by Adyard itself. 
KMM, which sees a strong market for kit 
build vessels of large size, made great efforts 
to ensure that modern technology was utilised 
to its maximum to help the inexperienced build 
learn. Production level drawings were 
provided for all outfit, mechanical and 
electrical systems using 3D CAD modelling 
software to ensure best use of space and to 
prevent conflict between systems. Machinery 
and equipment were also purchased to meet 
KMM specifications. 
A Wartsila NSD integrated propulsion 
system was selected. This comprises [wo 
KL26 engines, each developing 2.600kW at 
1.000 rev/min. driving Propae CP propellers 
of 2,950mm diameter in fixed Kontype 19A 
nozzles via Vokla ACG 600H gearboxes. 
Brunvoll transverse tunnel ihrustcrs, each of 
430kW and developing 6.3 tonnes of thrust, 
are fitted bow and stern, Team Salaiah has a 
bollard pull of 90 tonnes and a free-running 
speed of 15 knots. 
Fairly standard in terms of supply vessel 
layout, it has a 350m2 sheathed working deck 
area aft and 280m1 liquid mud tanks arranged 
amidships. Other lanks distributed along the 
length of the ship carry fuel oil (628m1); drill 
water (426m3); potable water (345m1); and 
bulk cement < 162m1). Accommodation caters 
for a total of 24 persons, of which 12 are 
considered passengers, and includes a hospital 
facility. 
Deck machinery, supplied by Plimsoll of 
Singapore, is dominated by w 120-tonne 
double drum tow/anchor handling winch, 
which is sited aft of the accommodation. 
Capable of pulling 159 tonnes, ils upper drum 
holds 1,000m of 62mm cable and the lower 
drum is fitted wilh 500m of 58mm tow wire. 
Additional equipment includes two 10-tonne 
lugger winches, shark jaw and tow pins, two 
5-lonne capstans, a combined anchor 
windlass and nylon rope storage winch and 
a 250-lonne SWL stem roller. 
FiFS I classification requirements are met 
by two gearbox driven !200inVhr Nijhuis 
fire pumps, which feed two Kvaerner foam/ 
water moniiors and a Wormald self-drenching 
system. Auxiliary power is supplied by a pair 
of 580kVV shaft generators backed up to two 
Cummins 284k\V NTA855-G2M dicsel gen 
sels and a 160kW 6CTA8.3G emergency set. 
The wheelhouse is dominated by Furuno 
electronics including a complete GMDSS 
set-up with Inmarsat C, two radar, deplh 
sounder ant! DGPS. The gyro and autopilot 
are of Anschulz type. 
The remaining three ships on order will 
have different internal and lop side 
configurations but will be constructed using 
identical hull components.

GRIFFON H-181: hovercraft 
for Indian Coast Guard 
UK based Griffon Hovercraft Ltd (GHL) completed its biggest vessel to dale in mld-99 
as part of a .six-vessel series for the Indian Coast Guard (ICG). 
The Griffon 800TD (M> hovercraft 
measures 21.Sin \ 11.30m, when its skirl is 
fully inflated, has a lop speed of 55 knots 
and a payload of 8 tonnes. The craft is in use 
for anti-smuggling and anti-infiltration 
duties, particularly in areas of very shallow 
water around tndia's extensive coastline and 
offshore islands. 
Armed with a 0.5 inch machine gun, llie 
Griffon's capability to operate in areas 
difficult, if not impossible, for conventional 
boats, has significantly enhanced the ICG 
tactics. Operated by a crew of two (phis eight 
seamen), il can lie up and dash out to intercept 
over land, very shallow water, sand, rocks 
and mud, taking the swiftest route. 
Alternatively, il can patrol like conventional 
craft using normal berths, piers and pontoons. 
The vessel is welded below the waterline, 
riveted and scaled above and has a 1.25m

speed of the lightweighl alloy craft, having 
body measurements of 19.85m x 8.70m. is 
45 knots, sea trials at launch confirmed an 
all-oui 55 knots from a power plant 
consisting oftwo597kW(800hp) MTU 12V 
I83TB 32 water-cooled diesels, each turning 
a 2,600mra variable pitch propeller, 
The forward raised wheelhouse has 
seating for three other crew members in 
addition to the helmsman. Down below, the 
fit-out is simple, to the customer's 
requirements, and comprises bench scaling 
for eighl with tables, a very basic windowless 
prison cell and a loile! compartment. 
One more of the six craft on order is lobe 
constructed in the UK with the four remaining 
due For assembly from knockdown kits at 
Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers 
Ltd(QRSE) in Calcutta. Personnel from the 
Indian company attended construction 
courses al Griffon's factory in Southampton. 
GHL, a leading player in the world of 
hovercraft with a 25-year history involving 
the design and construction of sonic 85 
vessels, believes thai local construction from 
kits is the way forward for significant future 
sales in the subcontinent. GRSE is reported 
as being equally confident

VIGILANT Class: Australian 
police invest in new patrol 
series 
Three 28.5 knot patrol boats, Vigilant, Mztlguard and Victor have substantially increased the 
Criminal interdiction capability of the New Soatfa Wales Police Service in Australia. Built at Image 
Marine in Western Australia, the craft are the lead trio in a nine-vessel order, which will comprise 
four further identical vessels and two larger boats at 22.00m x 5.50m. 
Featuring aluminium planing monohulls from 
Ihe yard's in-house design team, the vessels have a 
varying dead rise, with I lie vvaierlincenlry providing 
the least resistance ai full operational speed whilst 
offering maximum comfort in varied sea conditions. 
The first boats measure 16.00m x 4.88m with a 
draft of 1,2m, and are powered by twin Scania DI 
12 42 main engines driving Tcignbridge propellers 
through Twin Disc MG 5114 1A gearboxes. They 
have a maximum speed of 28.5 knots and a range 
of 400nm at the service speed of 18 knots. The 
22m long boats have the same design speed, from 
a pair of MAN D2842 dicsels driving via ZF BW 
155 gears, and increased endurance of 600nm al 
18 knots. 
Internally, the fit-out is both practical and durable 
with (\vo principal watertight living areas able to 
accommodate crews for short periods of time. Two 
i\\ in berth cabins are included for the smaller vessels 
in ihe series (three cabins for ihe 22.00m version) 
and a fully equipped galley and mess with sliding 
cabin walls lo enable Ihe area to be opened out For 
certain missions. 
The deck layout is equally practical and Includes 
a towing stanchion lo provide a limited towing 
capacity for small vessels in distress. The larger 
boats carry a 4.5m semi-inflatable daughter craft, 
which is slowed and launched from astern ramp 
recessed into (he main deck and used for pursuit 
dulies in shallow water. 
Wheelhousc equipment is fairly standard to all 
nine vessels. All craft have 360 degree vision from 
the pilothouse and separate workstations for 
command and surveillance functions, The 16m 
boats have a splil-level whcelhousc to further 
maximise all-round visibility and boili classes have 
a flybridge with duplicate controls. These have 
removable windscreens and himini lops. Onboard 
electronics include Raytheon R 121t)/6XXradar. a 
Raythcon L750 echo sounder. Nuv 420 DGPS 
system. Satcom communications systems and a 
Saura magnetic compass. 
Sergeant Graeme Jamieson. project manager for 
Ihe Police Services, expressed his satisfaction with 
(he yard's quality control u\ui reported thai the police 
delivery crews had remarked on the excellenl 
seagoing ability of the vessels, especially in heavy 
seas. "I am confident that this service now has the 
technologically superior and safe platforms to 
substantially increase marine criminal interdiction 
and improve our search and rescue capability," he 
said.

CHINOOK: all-
weather pilot boat 
serves the Bar 
Oft referred to as 'the graveyard of the Pacific', the Bur - where 
the Columbia River collides with Hie Pacific Ocean -
is known 
tor its extreme weather and turbulent waters. ChiftQok,the newest 
pilot boat in the Columbia River Bar Pilots Association of Astoria 
lleet of necessity had to be swift but exceedingly durable. 
Designed by Caraarc Ltd of the 
via DDA 6619 SC gearboxes 
UK and built by Kvichak Marine 
Industries. lac ol' Seattle, USA 
Chinook measures 22.2m x 6.4m, 
is of aluminium construction and 
reportedly offers a very stable ride 
when transporting pilots. 
The 
weather 
conditions 
demand lhat the vessel is capable 
nf surviving a 360 degree rollover, 
keeping erew and equipment 
intact. Chinook was, therefore, 
fully tested by Kvichak tin 
Seattle's Lake Union with the 
^sislance of a Toss barge crane. 
As the crane lifted the belts, the 
boat was turned over 1 SO degrees. 
the straps released themselves and 
the vessel successfully righted. 
The stability test was passed due 
In the vessel's low centre of 
gravity, superstructure buoyancy 
and all weather double chine bull 
design. 
Power is supplied by twin 
DDA I6V2000 diesels raled 
1.2S5hp at 2.1 (10 rev/min. These 
drive two Hamilton 65I waterjets 
with a 2.03:1 reduction ratio. 
During trials the boat achieved 
speeds of around 29 knots when 
fully loaded and with six crew 
aboard. The range has been 
assessed as 25()nni when a speed 
of 25 knots is maintained. 
Pilots 
are 
comfortably 
accommodated in four wcll-
padded leather upholstered airline 
style seals from Australian 
manufacturer Beurteaux in a 
spacious cabin, A day galley with 
microwave, refrigerator, freezer, 
sink and storage is incorporated. 
Good visibility is ensured by a 
total of 2H windows, supplied by 
Freeman and specified as 0.5inch 
tempered glass with boiled 
aluminium frames. A cabin aft lias 
two bunks and lockers and a 
separate shower/toilet cubicle 
alongside. 
Thewheclhonse area has raked

SAN FRANCISCO: standing 
by the Golden Gate 
Traditionally renowned for its impressive output of tugs and fishing vessels, MARCO 
Shipyard in Seattle, USA, has delivered the 31.7m San Francisco to the San Francisco 
Bar Pilots. The first of two new pilot station vessels outfitted with the latest technology, 
the pair replace existing 25.9m boats. Designed by the yard, the boats transfer pilots 
safely to and from ships entering or leaving San Francisco Bay, and provide quarters 
for the pilots between assignments. One remains on duty outside the Golden Gate 
Bridge at all times and under all conditions. 
This type of operation demands a different 
large rol] stabilisation tank located below the 
style of craft to tlie current trend of smaller, 
lighter and faster pilot boats and is reflected 
in the accommodation. Abaft the raised 
wheelbousc, the main deck features a 
spacious day room/lounge area with large 
windows, an entertainment and information 
centre, atidafutl galley. Armchair sealing is 
provided for nine persons. On the lower deck, 
accessed directly from the lounge, is an eight-
person berthing compartment for pilots 
forward, complete with two heads and a 
shower. Crew quarters for five are located 
aft of the amidships engine room. Sound 
levels have been kept to a minimum 
throughout all working and living spaces on 
the vessel. Comfort for all is enhanced by a 
pilothouse deck and large bilge keels on the 
hull. 
Measuring 37.1 m x 9.0m with a draft of 
2.7m. the all-steel vessel is powered by a 
pair of Caterpillar 3508B diesels, each 
delivering I, lOQhp to 1,630mm diameter 
Sound Propeller Ni-Al-Bron/e propellers 
through Twin Disc MG-5301 gearboxes with 
a reduction ratio of 4.06:1. The new vessel 
exceeded its 14-knot design speed during 
extensive sea trials in Pugel Sound and 
delivery trials on San Francisco Bay. The 
boat was accepted from its builders by Captain 
Peter Mclsaac. president of the San Francisco 
Bar Pilots. "We were delighted with the 
performance of this boat on her trials," he 
said, "and we look forward to placing her in 
service as soon as possible. She met our 
expectations, and I know the pilots will enjoy 
the new level of comfort and safety these 
boats will bring to the Bay," he concluded. 
Exceptionally good all-round visibility is 
offered from the wheelhouse. which lias 
direct internal access from the pilots' lounge 
and doors to bridge wings which have 
extending platforms to increase the boarding 
options available. Harris Electric of Seattle 
provided distribution panels, a master alarm 
panel, wiring and electronics. These include 
two Furuno FR21 1 5BB X-Band radar, two 
Furuno GP8OD GPS receivers, a Furuno 
FCV-29 colour depth sounder, a Transas chart 
plotting system with Ocean PC hardware, 
four SEA 156 VHF radios, a Sperry MK37 
VT gyrocompass, a Litton LMP HSC/GM 
autopilot, a Harris HelmAlert watch alarm, 
and a Ray 430 loudhailer. 
At the stern, the vessel carries a4.8m Ocean 
Tech RIB powered by a lOOhp diesel engine 
and waterjel, which can be used as an 
emergency rescue boat and for pilot transfers 
with low-freeboard vessels. The RIB is 
carried on a hydraulically powered cradle that 
lowers the boat for release while underway, 
and raises it to main deck level for stowage.

SPEEDY: Australian-built 
monohull for Europe 
Having celebrated its I5'h anniversary in 1999 willi the completion of its 60"' vessel, 
Western Australia-based WaveMaster International welcomed in the new millennium 
with the completion, on schedule, of the country's firs! large aluminium monohull 
ferry destined for service in Europe and the bi^est ever built hy the yard. Named 
Speedy, the 50m vessel carries up to 324 passengers between Bremen. Germany, and 
the Priesian Islands in the livery of Reederie Warringg - making (he SOnni crossing at 
a speed of 30 knots. 
The ferry measures 49.95m x 9.00m with 
a draft of 2.00m and air draft of 6m (restricted 
by bridges on its route). Power is derived 
from two Caterpillar 3516B main engines, 
each developing 2,694hp ai 1,855 rev/min, 
turning 1,220mm diameter ftve-bladcdhighly 
skewed Teignbrklgc propellers through ZF 
BW755 marine gears. Speed at 100 percent 
MCR is 30 knots at 32 tonnes deadweight in 
Beaufort 2 conditions. With a fuel 
consumption of 198g/kWh, this gives a range 
of 200nm. Electrics] supply is provided by 
two Caterpillar 3304B generator sets, each 
delivering 85kW at 1,500rev/min. 
All passenger accommodation is "lourisl 
class' on the main deck equipped with 
Beuiteaux 'Ocean Tourist' low back non-
reclining seats having aluminium arm rests, 
lifejacket pockets and magazine holders. 
These are laid out amidships in a 3-6-3 
formation tapering down to 2-4-2 forward. 
Kiosks arc provided for dispensing drinks 
and snacks. A zoned system of airconditioning 
and heating is used to optimise Ilic temperature 
across the entire seating area. The toilets are 
located aft where any noise and vibration from 
the "business end' of the vessels will have the 
least effect. However, in areas where seating is 
situated over machinery spaces, a floating deck 
has been incorporated. 
To reduce height, the wheelhousc, which 
sits over a service void, projects for only 
half of its height above the main saloon roof 
and the mast can be lowered by remote 
control. For close-quarter manoeuvring! open 
bridge wings are available on both sides. 
To counter the problems of passenger 
discomfort resulting from the notoriously 
lumpy seas in the operational area, a Maritime 
Dynamics ride control has been installed. This 
comprises four flaps aft responding 
automatically to pitch and roll motion sensors 
located throughout the vessel. 
Construction of (he vessel began in late 
November '99 and this was followed, in early 
January 2000 by the successful completion 
of exhaustive 
lank 
testing 
at 
the 
Schiffbautechnishe Versuchsanstalt in Wien 
GmbH (Vienna Model Basin). Self-propelled 
seakceping tests were carried out. witnessed 
by teams from both WaveMaster and 
Reederie Warrings, in which North Sea 
conditions were replicated. These were 
conducted in significant wave heights of two 
metres at speeds of up to 27 knots in head 
and beam seas and at 30 degrees to the bow. 
The model was subjected to both regular and 
irregular wave patterns. At the conclusion of 
these tests, Richard An/bock, deputy director 
ol the basin, said thai he was impressed with 
the seakeeping characteristics and predicted 
thai it would be ideal for North Sea 
operations. 
The launch was completed at the very end 
of April, following an hour and a half journey 
on a heavy [If! vehicle from the yard's 
production hall to die launch site. Immediately 
after the launch, Speedy began a demanding 
Tour-week schedule of sea trials before final 
acceptance and delivery to Germany.

FLYING CLOUD: high speed 
cat on Nantucket routes 
Derektor Shipyards ol1 New York. USA, utilised a IK design from Nigel Gee Associates 
to build Flying Cloud, a 41m long aluminium catamaran for Martha's Vineyard anil 
Nantuckct Steamship Authority, Woods Hole. 
Designed for year-round passenger services 
to ihe islands of Nantuckel and Martha's 
Vineyard, Ihe vessel has been constructed lo 
meet USCG Subchapter K full compliance and 
carries 300 passengers at a service speed of 36 
knots. The wake-wash generated by i!ie hull 
design is claimed to he extremely low. even at 
high speeds and the journey time on the Hyannis 
Port to Naniuckei route is less than half that of 
competitive traditional ferries. 
Power is derived from two Paxman 12 
VP 185 dicsel engines driving Kamewa 71 
SI1 walerjets via Reintjes gearboxes. The jet 
intake tunnels are made of glass fibre to 
minimise corrosion problems and ensure 
long, lrouble-free working life. Passenger 
comfort is enhanced by a Maritime Dynamics 
ride control system, which comprises a T-
foil and interceptor on each hull for a smooth 
ride in sea conditions up to sea-state 4. 
The main deck seats 171 passengers in 
airline quality seats and features a full service 
bar and four toilets aft. The upper deck has 
129 seats with a central lounge area and small 
bar and exterior sealing is provided all to 
give passengers the option of open-air travel. 
Both decks are fitted with a four-season 
H VA C s y s i e m to main 
t ai n c oust a n i 
temperatures and eliminate window fogging. 
As Flying Cloud is a bow-loading vessel, 
U has a large cargo storage area in the bow 
capable of holding up to 9,0001b of luggage. 
The area can befitted out with bicycle racks 
and wheeled cads to facilitate handling of 
passenger luggage. 
A raised pilothouse has all-run ml visibility 
and is equipped with Ihe latest electronic and 
navigation aids. The package includes Iwo 
Rayllieon ARPA units; a Maritime Dynamics 
autopilot; Northstar 941XD DGPS; Sperry 
compass: Transas chart plotter; Vistar night 
vision system; and two [COM M-127VHI's. 
In recent years Derektor has established 
itself as a leading builder of high-speed craft 
in North America. It enjoys a reputation for 
very high standards of aluminium fabrication 
and machinery installation and a weight-
conscious approach lo vessel construction.

THE LYNX: biggest 
aluminium ship to be built 
in Australia 
Launched as Incat Tasmania, The Lynx is already well known for its starring role at the 
Sydney Olympics. The llrst vessel in the Involution 101$ class I'rom Incat Australia, the 
ferry is currently on long term charter to New Zealand operator Tranz Rail. 
The Evolution 1 OB class extends meat's 
10 year history in the production of high 
speed wave-piereing ferries and delivers 
proven technology in a vessel capable of 
carrying a mix of passengers and freight at 
speeds over 40 knots. The Lynx, measuring 
98m x 26m is the largest aluminium ship 
built to date in Australia. 
Designed to accommodate up to 900 
persons, the passenger area is on one deck 
and comprises three lounge areas. Each 
features its own style of sealing, colour 
scheme and facilities. Passengers travelling 
without cars enter die ship through large side 
entry doors into the central Midships Lounge, 
the focal point for many onboard activities as 
it is surrounded by the shop, kiosk and 
outside seating areas. 
Travellers can also sit in the Forward 
Lounge, which boasts 300 degree panoramic 
views or, if travelling with ears, in the Aft 
Lounge. Disability access is second to none 
due to a new ramp system, which ensures 
that the entire passenger area is wheelchair 
accessible. 
The vessel's vehicle deck offers a total of 
380 truck lane metres. 3.1m wide x 4.3m 
clear height and 360 car lane metres at 2.3m 
width x 2.1 m height. Suitable for heavy road 
transport vehicles, the main vehicle deck also 
benefits from unrestricted height of 6m and 
an unobstructed width of 18m at the stern. 
Nine hoistable mezzanine vehicle decks 
give the operator the flexibility to carry 260 
cars and no heavy vehicles or 12 road freight 
trailers with 180 cars, or 24 road freight 
trailers with 85 cars while offering the 
headroom demanded by oversized freight 
vehicles when raised. The vehicle decks, with 
clear lane markings painted on the deck, 
ensure fast vehicle loading and unloading 
with the flexibility eo alter the configuration 
on a voyage lo voyage basis. 
The raised wheelhouse is small fora vessel 
o\' its size. Large windows provide 360-
degree visibility for llie officers over the new 
aerodynamic superstructure, while an aft-
facing docking console and CCTV monitors 
negate the need for bridge wings with their 
associated windage. Consistent with all recent 
Incat vessels, the control station is fitted with 
the latest in electronic, navigation and 
communication equipment to comply with 
High Speed Craft Code Sea Area A2.' 
Unlike incaTs first three Evolution 10 
Class vessels, which had Caterpillar 3618 
diescls installed, The Lynx is powered by 
four Ruslou 20RK270 medium speed diesels 
developing in excess of 2S.0O0kW, The 
engines drive transom-mounted stcerable 
Lips 120E waterjets via Reintjes VLJ6831 
gearboxes. All four walerjels arc configured 
f0 r steering and reversing w bile an 
independent hydraulic system in each hull 
covers the steering and reverse functions. A 
new feature is the introduction of the new 
Lips six-bladcd, high-speed, high pressure 
waterjcl incorporating a completely new 
control arrangement. Developed jointly by 
Incal and Lips, the new hydraulic cylinder 
layout is claimed to eliminate much of the 
maintenance and operational problems 
experienced by Incat on previous waterjei 
models. An additional benefit of the new jet 
is a big reduction in weight compared with 
the earlier I50D units, providing a saving of 
around 30 tonnes. The new E scries waterjets 
will also form the basis of any new Incatgas 
turbine powered vessels in the future, 
Another major improvement over earlier 
Incat vessels can be seen in the main engine 
dry exhaust system. First seen on Incal 053 
Bentayga Express, the new system propels 
engine exhaust away from the vessel via twin 
funnels on top of the aft superstructure instead 
of into the tunnel between the vessel's hulls. 
Developed in co-operation with litcal's main 
engine suppliers Caterpillar and Ruston, the 
objective of the new exhaust system was lo 
meet new international noise and emission 
standards-. Early tests demonstrated that it 
meets noise level requirements set out by the 
Danish Maritime Authority for the Incal9Im 
vessels Mads Mais and Max Mais, currently 
trading between Arhus and Odden. The 
system has also been designed to lake catalytic 
converters, improving already efficient 
emission controls.

To further improve sea keeping qualities. 
The Lynx is fitted with a Maritime Dynamics/ 
Incat Ride Control System consisting of 
transom mounted trim tabs and a new 
retractable bow T-foil. These, combined with 
a new hull form featuring longer outer bows, 
fuller midship sections, stern skeglets and 
improved centrebow clearances, means 
motion sickness incidence has reduced by 
up to 40 per cent in higher sea states by 
reducing pitch, roll and heave, (he major 
contributors Eo passenger discomfort. 
The vessel is fitted with six evacuation 
stations. Two of these, on each side of the 
vessel, contain an 1MO approved MES 
(Marine Evacuation System) supplied by 
Liferaft Systems Australia, with an additional 
liferaft access sUilion on each aft mooring 
deck. An MES consists of an inflatable slide, 
which connects with multiple 100-person 
liferafts. The evacuation arrangement has 
proved capable of evacuating the full vessel's 
complement in times much faster than the 
IMO requirements. In addition, the vessel is 
designed and built with high levels of reserve 
buoyancy, fire detection/protection and safety 
systems redundancy. 
11 obart-based company Colheck & Gunion 
supplied a lightweight structural fire 
protection system including fire doors and 
dampers. The 'Rapid Access" (deckhead) and 
'Lightweight' (bulkhead) system meets all 
the demands for lighter weight and faster 
installation/removal for this type of craft. An 
addressable fire detection system, CCTV 
cameras, zoned fire sprinkler systems and 
hydrants protect engine rooms, vehicle decks 
anil passenger areas. The Lynx is also fitted 
with portable fire extinguishers, fire-
protection suits and equipment, water fog 
applicators, brealhing apparatus, international 
connections and fire control plans to meet 
IMO requirements.

control of the vessel's waterjels at speeds in 
excess of 25 knots, allowing all waterjct 
thrust to be vectored for maximum propulsive 
thrust and eliminating bucket drag. Seastate 
estimates suggest that average service .speed 
improvements of over two knots can be 
achieved in rough sea operations. A quadruple 
engine/waterjet propulsion package is 
installed, comprising MTU 16V595 diesels, 
each developing 3,866fcW at 1,750 rev/min 
and Kamewa type 9-0 SI I jets 10 give a service 
speed of 40 knots. 
To enable passengers to board Highspeed 2 
in a safer manner, passenger-loading gangways 
are hinged offlhc walerjel guard at the aft end 
of each hull. Of 
a fixed length, these are raised 
and lowered hydraulically. and designed to 
operate simultaneously with, but independently 
of. the vehicle ramp. 
The craft's mode ol'"stem-to' berthing also 
presented the yard with a challenge since the 
Greek islands are notorious for gusty and 
variable winds during (he summer when there 
is maximum pressure to maintain schedule. 
This has been solved by utilising a 
combination of specially designed mooring 
and anchor windlasses and high specification 
anchors to ensure rapid deployment and 
recovery. 
With 1250m- devoted to passengers and 
support services, the vessel is outfitted to a 
high standard. Amlico flooring incorporating 
an 'oak timber' look is used extensively 
throughout heavy traffic areas, creating a 
stylish yet durable finish. On the main 
passenger deck, a wide range of facilities is 
provided and includes two kiosk/restaurant 
areas, a children's playroom and a games 
room with several arcade machines. The 
shopping area and information counter is 
located amidships and ample baggage racks 
arc provided. 
Reclining seals, supplied by 
Beurteanx Australia, are fcalured 
throughout the main deck in a 
combination of airline and table 
arrangements. The business 
class seating area for 128 
passengers is located forward on 
the main deck with panoramic 
windows across the full width 
of the superstructure.

with sound systems in the armrest. An 
exclusive appointment to this lounge is the 
inclusion of 24 individual game systems 
mounted in the seats - similar to those now 
widely used in the airline industry. It is also 
equipped with a bar/kiosk and generous 
baggage racks. A covered outdoor sealing 
area for 28 passengers is also available aft on 
the main deck. 
The vessel will operate with 24 crew and 
has extensive crew facilities. Captain and

AREMITI 4: Flying Cat for 
Tahiti 
One of the earliest tasks in 2000 for Damcn Shipyards Singapore Pte Ltd - the company 
newly formed by the Dutch Dainen group after its take-over of Kvaerner Fjellstrand 
in Singapore - was to find a buyer for a 49.00m x 12.50m Flying Cat 50 fast ferry, 
eompleted but unsold. 
Originally ordered by a Maltese customer, 
the vessel - to become Aremiti 4 - underwent 
substantial modifications in order to meet the 
needs of a new customer. Damen set about 
major alterations to the brand new vessel by 
increasing its passenger carrying capacity in 
the main saloons from 408 to 455. This 
involved removing the crew accommodation, 
lidding seating for 50 on an upper sundeck. 
providing a new porlsidc access and making 
structural alterations to the hull bottom lo 
satisfy French Administration damage 
Stability requirements. 
The end result meets 1MO HSC Code 
Category B requirements and is classed wilh 
Germanischer Lloyd. 
Capable of speeds of 37.5 knots. Aremiti 
4 is powered by four MTU 16V 4000 M70 
diesels, each driving a Kamewa 63 SII 
walerjel via a ZF BW 755-ID gearbox. A 
Kvaerner motion dampening system is fitted. 
comprising forward T-foils and stern trim 
flaps. 
Interior accommodation, as specified by 
owner Aremiti Pacific Cruises, provides for 
i 50 passengers in a main deck forward saloon 
and 295 passengers in an upper deck saloon. 
The former also houses a bar/kiosk and five 
toilets and Ihe hitler a bar aft and five toilets 
forward. Sealing is of the Eknes Transit 
Super Nova 1410 type for the saloons and

of ihe passenger saloon. Accommodalion for
