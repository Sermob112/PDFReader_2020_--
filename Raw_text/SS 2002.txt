KKNANDQ TAPIAS lias been built for the 
nospottation of liquefied natural gas (LNG), 
and special attention has been paid in her design to 
the facilities at loading and discharging betths 
worldwide, 10 ensure compatibility of mooring 
arrangements, fender contact areas, gangway and 
tniimtiild positions, ami other aspects. Laid out with 
ii continuous single deck, and a sunken aft deck, the 
vessel has four cargo tanks, constructed on the Gaz 
Transport membrane system (GT No 96 E-2), 
positioned in a double-hull configuration which is 
extended above the deck to form a trunk. 
Gas is maintained at a tempt-ram re of -163"C with 
a maximum boil-off rate of less than 0.15% fully 
loaded car^o volume. Primary/secondary barriers of 
36l'u nickel-steel (Invar) alloy are fitted in the cargo 
tanks, with plywood boxes filled with expanded 
pear 
lite 
forming primary/ secondary insulation. 
Underdeck passageways in the trunk deck space 
provide fore and aft access, and a duct keel in the 
double bottom serves as a pipe and cable passage. 
The cargo handling systems are designed to 
load/discharge cargo within 12hours, using two sets 
of ITOOm'/h pumps and one stripping/spray pump 
in each tank, forming a complete assembly within a 
'tripod mast' construction with Saab cadatbeam-type 
level gauges, and all 
fittings and pipes. Vapour 
handling 
equipment 
such 
as 
two 
high-duty 
compressors, two low-duty compressors, one main 
and one forcing vaporiser, and two boil-off/warm-
up heaters, are arranged in the cargo machinery 
room. 
The main propulsion unit is a Kawasaki UA-360 
cross-compound 
steam 
turbine, 
developing 
36,000shp ;u 88rev/min (behind the gearbox). The 
unit has high-
and law-pressure turbines, double-
reduction gearing, main condenses, anil astern 
uirbine. Two dual-fuel boilers supply steam for the 
main turbine, steam auxiliaries, and turbo-generators. 
Two ot the latter Me installed for electrical power 
together with one diesel-powered sei. Each develops 
a similar output of 345UkW Current is transmitted 
to three switchboards (main, cargo, and emergency) 
located in separate rooms. An integrated automation 
system is fitted, and control and monitoring is carried 
out from the cargo and engine control rooms. 
Accommodation 
and 
navigation 
spaces 
are 
arranged right ait, with the latter designed lor 
optimum operational safety around a modular 
workstation, fitted far one-man operation, and 
meeting all design and layout requirements ol the BY 
notation +SYS-NKQ-1.

THIS new series of innovative gas carriers has been 
introduced specifically to improve the service 
Norgas provides for its customers, particularly bj-
reducing port turn-around-time. To accomplish ibis, 
Tractcbcl Gus lingineering, Germany, sub-supplier of 
the gas plant, developed an installation in which [MO 
tank pressure has been increased from 4.5bar to 7bar 
:ind, in conjunction with the use of maximum cooling 
capacity, quoted as 2'C/day in tropical waters, loading 
time for ambient propylene at 25"C has been cut by 
two/three days, compared with that of similar 
conventional vessels, whilst between four and 10 days 
can be saved when cooling a cargo from 25"C to -46"C. 
By adopting a 'make-it-simple' philosophy, the 
designers 
have-
developed 
a 
tank 
and 
piping 
arrangement for easy operation, which ensures that in 
any loading condition critical stability conditions are 
never reached. 
Cargo processing equipment 
is 
automated, and controlled from the bridge, along with 
ballasting and operation of the main engine. 
This 'super-cooler' design features a shallow-draught 
and wide-beam arrangement that allows the vessel to 
load and discharge on an even keel, and to take on a 
large cargo in shallow-water ports. Manoeuvrability 
obtained from the high-efficiency flap rudder and bow 
thmster enables the vessel to track sideways and turn in 
its own length, thereby contributing to the fast turn 
around required. 
Within a double-skin hull, whose side tanks arc used 
for water ballast, there are two cargo tanks of 5322m' 
and 3139m1 capacity, respectively, their cylindrical 
shape with spherical ends offering 30% less surface 
area than bi-lobe designs. In addition, a cylindrical 
90m' cryogenic rank is installed on the upper deck for 
the carriage of coolant, with a vaporising system 
enabling a quick 'gassing-up' process. A nitrogen 
production plant is also fitted, allowing the vessel to 
purge its tanks on route, and, in combination with the 
deck tank, to carry out a full change of grade whilst at 
sea: in both cases arriving at a terminal ready tor 
loading. Discharge of LPG without the need for the 
use of water as a heat transfer fluid is made possible by 
the inclusion of a thermal oil heating system. 
JVmgw Orinda is fitted with a MAN B&W 6L48/60 
main engine, developing 6300kW MCEl and driving a 
CP propeller through a gearbox which has a power 
take-oft for a 1700kW alternator. The arrangement is 
designed to operate in reverse - as a 'power take-in' ns 
part of a lully redundant, 'lake me home' main engine 
installation, where power from the auxiliary engines is 
directed back through the gearbos to provide limited 
propulsion in an emergency. Additional electrical 
supply is derived from lour 550k\V diesel alternators.

rapid expansion of underwater, fibre-optic 
cable link* has seen a growing demand for speedy 
vessels to lay new networks worldwide, and to maintain 
riiem in service (although unfortunately the market 
today is 
severe])' diminished as a result of over-
confidence in this sector). As Sigujkani Ships lias shown 
over recent years, the adoption of a fully stem-work ing 
concept to earn' out these duties has proved very 
successful, with die offshore supply vessel (OSV) 
configuration providing rhe ideal plaiform. 
As a leading designer of thai 
type of vessel, 
Vik-S:mdvik has been able to move easily into this new 
mode, and PnSJw&a is an example of ihe suitability of 
this ubiquitous design tor such work. The attraction of 
the OSV is the long, continuous ;ift deck, :md when this 
is virtually completely covered by a long forecastle, an 
ideal workshop area is the result. On lop of this, a 
superstructure accommodating 75 personnel has been 
built, with control ot :dl navigation and cable operations 
carried out from a large whcelhousL1 positioned above 
this, forward of midships. 
Pertinada'll equipped to handle any type of underwater 
telecommunication cable from 14mm to 150mm 
diameter, complete with repeaters up to ■100mm 
diameter. Onboard cable storage is provided in two tanks 
having a total capacity of around 6ufluronnes. Two 
smaller tanks increase that by some 400tonnes and can be 
used lo hold recovered cable. Arrangements have been 
made for the use of modern equipment and technology, 
lor table burying by plough, and ROV operation, also 
buoy deployment ;uid retrieval. 
The cable-handling system consists of one 4m diameter 
cable-drum engine, one 2IJtonnu linear cable engine, with 
20 wheel pairs, and one ("itonne draw-off/hold-back unit 
with six wheel pairs. All arc capable of local or bridge 
control. A I4utonuc Hydralift traction winch and a 
storage winch are fitted on the weather deck, whilst a 
(SOtOBne plough-handling A-fnime. also from I lydralift, 
operates over the stern. A helideck on the forecastle can 
host a 19.5m helicopicr. 
A dies el-electric propulsion system is fitted, using two 
electrically driven Bteerable thrusiers under the stern. 
These arc powered from tour 3"?5OkVA alternator sets 
with 3240k\V Wartsilii HR32 diesel prime movers, which 
ensure a service speed whilst in repair mode of 
M.SOknots, and approximately 4knots when laying, A 
bollard, pull of lUOtonnes is attainable, 'together with two 
side thrusters and a retractable thrusler forward, [he 
system 
presents 
a 
fully 
dynamically 
positioned 
arrangement 
with 
station 
keeping 
and 
tracking 
capabilities. With all propellers and thrusrers operating, 
Wrtimida can maintain position or route under drift effect 
of Beaufort 9 (wind speed 40knors), and sea state 8 (wave 
heighi 7m and current 2knois). The DP installation 
includes echo sounders, doppler Ing, hydrographic echo 
sounder, clinometers, DGPS, HCDIS, H1PAP, and 
transponders.

Till' viist uxtent of Russia's navigable canals, 
rivers and liikcs, allows cargo to be transported 
from virtually every inland port in ilic country to 
river terminals throughout Buiope, and to lie open 
sea. 
This 
massive 
trade 
has 
resulted 
in 
the 
development, over many years, 
of 
specialised 
rivet/sea cargo ship designs, mainly identified by 
their long and narrow configuration. Mum of these 
ships an- now elderly, and a new series of lliis unique 
ship-type, known as the Valday class (also designated 
Projeci 01010), now under construction at the St 
Petersburg yard of Sevctnflfa, will, ii is hoped, serve 
to introduce a new er.\ 
tnto Russian merchant 
shipbuilding. 
Despite 
their 
characteristic 
proportions, 
the 
river/sea 
designs have proved acceptable 
for 
international trading over the years, to die extent that 
the Severnaya shipyard is currently developing n 
single-screw version of die Vaiday class for sea-only 
service. 
St Apostle Andrew leiiturts three lung, large 
holds, closed by MacGregor Foldtite hatch covers 
huilt upon a high coaming. A fore and aft gangway 
runs between forecastle and poop decks to provide a 
working platform at this level, and also acts as 
protection For the access passage u upper deck level. 
The double-hull structure ensures box-shaped cargo 
spaces 
suitable 
for 
a 
wide range 
of 
general 
commodities carried in hulk or sacks, as well as 
packaged and loose timber, palletised vegetables, steel 
coils up to 35ionnes weight, paper reels, and 267TEU, 
up to 2IJ of which can be refrigerated. No cargo gear 
is 
fitted, 
and the 
folding signal mast forward 
contributes to a long, open and Rat, cargo stowage 
area on top of the hatch covers. 
A twin-screw machinery installation is based upon a 
pair of Wiirtsilii 6L20C main engines, built at the 
designer's Finnish works. Each of these develops 
1080kW and drives an 1J'IJ propeller through a Itdntjcs 
reduction gearbox, A rudder is fitted behind each 
propeller and a ISUkW tunnel-type thruster operates 
at die bow. Electrical power is derived from three 
Caterpillar diesel-ilriven 
160k\V alternator sets. 
Emphasising the probable dual role of the vessels, 
St Apostk Andrew carries a free-fall lifeboat at the 
stern, whilst another prominent feature common to 
Russian vessels is a stern anchor and -.vinch.
