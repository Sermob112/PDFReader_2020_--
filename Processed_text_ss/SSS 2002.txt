MMA is a newly designed 14.95m fish farm
workboat,
from Macduff
Ship Design,
of
Grampian, Scotland, which has been created for
carrying and anchor-handling duties. She has been built
for Aquascot, a company that are involved in the
sustainable farming of salmon, sea-grown trout, and
turbot, and will operate at the company's site on the Isle
of Gigha, Scotland.
Macduff
Ship Design produced the cutting
information for this vessel as a computer file, enabling a
kit of parts to be produced by Macduff Profilers.
The conservatively-rated main engine, a Mermaid
Mistral, is a six-cylinder, turbocharged heavy duty marine
diesel engine and is based on the highly reliable Ford
'Dover' series industrial engine. This features a specially
matched water-cooled turbo-charger that enables low
fuel consumption to be achieved. These two diesel
Teignbridge 900mm handled propellers through PRM4:1 reduction ratio gearboxes. A PTO on one gearbox
provides hydraulic power for a Palfinger carne on the
starboard deck, and a capstan to port.
Interestingly, there are two options for fish storage,
catch can either be carried in a vivier tank, or stored in
tubs as deck cargo.

S
hanmhari is the newly designed Typhoon 38 from
Cygnus Marine, based in Cornwall, for Bressay
Salmon of the Shetland Isles. This 11.7m vessel is a
fast fish-farm workboat.
She is powered by a single Scania DS12 575hp to give
a maximum speed of over 20knots, while the engine is
located slightly forward of midship, to allow space for
a removable 5tonne capacity aluminium hopper/feed
blower system.
A Palfinger hydraulic crane is located aft, to load on
the feed bags from the quayside, ensuring self-
sufficiency, and a rapid turn-around time for the
operator. The twin unit hydraulic pump system also
drives a capstan back aft, for lines and anchor handling.
Three berths and a toilet compartment are located in
the fore cabin, with crew dinette, galley, and helm
position in the wheelhouse. In addition to the usual
electronics, is an underwater video set to monitor
conditions in cages during feeding.
The Typhoon design has proved to be a remarkable
success story since the original 10.3m version was
launched at the Southampton Boat Show in 2001, with
a 10m now fishing in Exmouth, another about to be
launched as a fishing vessel in Skye, a 10.3m nearly
completed in Belgium, and one 10m and two 12.8m
versions being built in Ireland, along with many other
orders reportedly under negotiation.
