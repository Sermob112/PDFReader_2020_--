T
he ASD tugs Arkad-1 and Arkad-2 were designed
and built expressly to perform a unique barge-
handling operation at the Iskenderun thermal power
station in southern Turkey. Due to relatively shallow
water, bulk carriers must be lightered offshore.
The
cargo is transferred via a floating offshore ship unloader
into a pair of 10,000dwt self-unloading barges. The tugs
manoeuvre the barges into place under the twin-hulled
floating unloader (much like threading the eye of a
needle, with very little margin for error), and then push
them to shore for the final cargo transfer, returning with
an empty barge.
These two high-performance tugs were delivered to
Egon Oldendorff by Uzmar Uzmanlar Shipping &
Trading Co Ltd, of Izmir, Turkey. Designated as a new
ASD 26/45 Class tug, they were designed by Robert
Allan Ltd, of Vancouver, and were built under direction
of Uzmar as the Prime Contractor in Tuzla, Istanbul.
Propulsion comprises a pair of CAT 3512B diesel
engines, each rated 1305kW at 1600rev/min, driving
Rolls-Royce US 205 Z-drives in a conventional ASD
configuration. This combination delivers a continuous
bollard pull of 40tonnes, and provides a free running
speed in excess of 12.8knots.
The deck machinery is designed to enable the tugs to
connect bow first to the transom of a barge for pushing
in sheltered waters, without need for a barge notch or a
patented coupler system. The components include a pair
of manual barge connector winches on the fore deck,
and a double-drum hydraulic winch on the aft deck that
tensions the two primary connector cables around a pair
of large diameter sheaves located close to the transom.
The tugs have accommodation for a full live-aboard
crew of up to seven persons, complete with a spacious
galley and well-appointed mess/lounge area on the
main deck.

ong Kong Salvage & Towage (HKST) has
recently taken delivery of two of the first six
newbuildings ordered from Kegoya Dock Co of
Kure, Japan. The first four vessels are based upon
its earlier Peng Chau class, although the new tugs are
slightly longer, they are much quieter in the crew
spaces, and feature what is claimed to be an
improved accommodation layout. At 4000bhp and
classed for ocean going, these compact tugs are also
ideal for harbour towage. The final two newbuildings
will be upgrades on the Lam Tong class of harbour
tugs.
The first of the newbuildings has been named Sha
Chau, and the second Cheung Chau. This continues the
HKST tradition of naming its tugs after places in
Hong Kong. Length overall is 29m, with a bollard
pull of 53.5tonnes at 100% MCR, and enhanced
bunker capacity.
These newbuildings were required to meet the
demands on the fleet as a result of expansion into
new markets in recent years. Harbour and ocean-
going tugs from the HKST fleet are now working in
Mexico, the West Indies, Arabian Gulf, Australia, and
Indonesia, in addition to their base areas of Hong
Kong and the South China Sea. The new tugs will
initially work in Hong Kong, where the harbour fleet
is under-strength, to permit the release of tugs
chartered in by HKST. As additional newbuildings
arrive, they will be made available to the wider
market. At the same time Tap Mun, the oldest tug in
the HKST fleet, has been sold to Middle East
interests.

hristian Reinauer is a seagoing tug, from Ocean Tug
& Barge Engineering Corp's Atlantic class series of
Articulated Tug/Barges (AT/B). The power portion of
an AT/B tug is designed to fit into the notch of a
145,000 barrel-capacity ocean double-hulled tank barge,
RTC 145. Christian Reinauer is the second vessel of this
class for the Reinauer Transportation Companies fleet,
based in New York.
She was built by Alabama Shipyard, of Mobile,
Alabama. Collectively, this series represent what is claimed
to be the most successful and popular class of AT/B tugs
in North America, spanning five vessels and three
different owners. Perhaps what is unique, is the fact that
they are essentially a custom design, as opposed to a
shipyard design, which was once the norm in the US
market.
Their success is due to the fact that owners are
increasingly looking toward designs optimised for
performance, longevity, and ease of maintenance, as
opposed to designs keyed to shipyard profitability, or
lowest capital cost. Christian Reinauer features oversized
rudders, corrosion-resistant piping systems, and additional
steel that is placed to minimise future structural problems.
Her owner, with long experience in operating tugs and
barges offshore, had specified the highest quality in fit-
out, and many of Christian Reinauer's components are
designed beyond class requirements. The aim of this class
tug was to create a vessel whose total ownership cost over
many years, was the baseline design criteria - not merely
first cost.
Christian Reinauer's accommodation, is claimed to be first
class, with large cabins, a crew lounge, and a galley located
above the forecastle deck, where the notch of the barge
does not interfere with the influx of natural light into the
space. Ergonomic design was applied throughout the
boat. Safety is also paramount, and here, Reinauer spared
no expense, from the amount of steel in the tug, to the
SOLAS fire-protection and generating plant, to the
extensive bridge electronics package. Her main engines
are Caterpillar, mode1 3612, rated in this vessel at
3600bhp at 900rev/min, which is well below what the
4640bhp at  900rev/min engines are capable of. In this
way, longevity is assured.
However, her stability, Lufkin RHS 3200 gears,
shaftline, and piping systems, are all designed to the full
power of the Cat 3612, so that in the future, with a
propeller change, she can be run at the full, available
9280bhp if required. This tug design has been a major
factor in introducing ship-like reliability in ETA's to US
clean product terminals.

T
he fireboat Elite was delivered in April and now acts
as a replacement for the aged Alexander Grantham,
for the Fires Services Department, HKSAR. She has
been in service since May.
This vessel was designed and built to enhance the
functional roles of fire fighting for vessels including
ocean going merchantmen; fire fighting of coastal
regions; search and rescue in case of marine disasters;
diving support; and command centre for directing major
operations.
Elite, a monohull designed to LRS 100A1 Tug
designation, is propelled with two sets of CAT3516B
diesel engines, which also serve as fire pumps, and
deliver a 15knot cruising speed. A highly automated
Unitor external fire fighting system with firewater
pumping capacity totalling 7200tonnes/hr, make Elite, it
is claimed, the world's most dedicated fireboat.
Onboard firefighting equipment meets Fi-Fi 11
requirements, with 2 x 40,000litres/min water monitors
at maximum throwing distance of 90m, a deluge water
screen, and foam making facilities.
A Southern Oceanics diving cage, with a three-diver
capacity and a maximum working depth of 60m, was
fitted to carry out diving operations. This diving cage is
said to be unique, and the first of its kind within
HKMD's marine fleet. A Boston Whaler rescue boat is
carried on deck, launched, and recovered by a Palfinger
deck crane. A helicopter winching area is provided for
rapid transport of survivors back to shore.
A specially designed wheelhouse has 360deg windows
for all round vision. In addition, a skylight is fitted on the
top of the wheelhouse, so that firefighting can be easily
monitored from this area. Consoles and control stands
are purposely profiled to meet operational requirements,
separated into coxswain station, navigator station, and
commander station. A dedicated fire fighting and
engineering station is provided as the central
commander centre. Internal spaces and roomy and
functional for attending crew members.
Fully air-conditioned accommodation is provided for
15 crew, with two single cabins, and one six-man crew
cabin. Additionally, Elite is outfitted with a 16-seater
conference room, a 20-seater mess room, a 25-seater
briefing room, and a survivor cabin, with space for 100
people.

ubai Drydocks delivered it's first double 
skinned vessel this summer, the 45m offshore 
service ship GAC Mumtaz to Gulf  Agency Co. This 
specialist design - claimed to be the world's only 
double skin, purpose built lube oil barge - will 
operate off  Fujairah, supplying lubricating oil, fresh 
water, stores, and spares to the ships that use the 
busy anchorage off  the east coast of  the United 
Arab Emirates. GAC Mumtaz was completed ahead 
of  schedule.
The United Arab Emirates area is currently 
working towards a greater awareness in 
environmental damage caused by oil spills and 
accidents, and Gulf  Agency Co wanted a double 
hulled vessel to show a commitment to safer 
shipping, and cleaner oceans. Gulf  Agency Co man 
its ships with highly trained personnel who are 
prepared to deal with oil spills, accidents, or any 
other eventuality.
GAC Mumtaz’ unique design satisfied the owners 
requirements for an open deck providing flexibility 
to carry deck cargo or containers in addition to 
414m3 of  lubricating oil and 195m3 of  fresh water. 
She can also store can store seven different grades 
of  lube oil. Her cargo capacity is further increased 
by six 20ft tank containers on deck. 
GAC Mumtaz has an air conditioned wheelhouse 
and accommodation for 10 crew. Her bridge 
superstructure has been designed to be well inboard 
from the ship sides to facilitate mooring alongside 
large VLCCs and ULCCs.
Machinery installed includes twin propellers, 
powered by two 700hp marine Cummins diesel 
engines.  Electrical power is supplied by two 120kW 
Scania generators.  Navigation and communication 
equipment has been installed to meet the latest IMO 
regulations.  The pump room houses three cargo 
pumps for the transfer of  lubricating oil.  A 
hydraulic deck crane is installed in front of  the 
accommodation to handle the deck loading.

H
aven Hornbill is a twin screw multi-role oil spill
recovery vessel of 19.50m and has a welded steel
hull throughout. Her hull is of flat-bottom single chine
configuration, with swim ends forward and aft. This
also incorporates a shallow V counter and transom
stern with rounded quarters. She will operate at
Harwich port, for Harwich Haven Authority.
Her oil recovery system was designed and supplied by
Oy LMP Patents Ltd, and comprises a complete Lori oil
recovery system, type LORS HK-4/3.5, with four
brushes to port and starboard. Oil recovery channels
are incorporated in both sides of the vessel outboard
midships - compartments are 4.8m long and 1.2m wide
- casings are built on the main deck with top-opening
hatches for maintenance and removal of equipment.
For separating oil and debris the recovery channels are
fitted with standard LORI brush packs, each with four
brush chains mounted in aluminium alloy frames,
approximately 3500mm long. The brush is cleaned by a
comb installed at the upper end, which discharges oil
and debris into a collection hopper.
Recovered oil is dropped from the brushes into the
receiving sump from where it is transferred to recovery
tanks via two Desmi model DOP-250 heavy duty
submersible, hydraulically-powered pumps, complete
with cutting knives for debris.
Output is 0cm
3/hr-
70cm
3/hr, and the discharge pipe is 150NB mild steel,
complete with a diverter valve to control flow to the
forward or aft recovered oil tanks.
An oil skimming boom can be rigged on both sides of
Haven Hornbill and the height of the boom is tapered
outwards with adequate height close to the vessel,
compensating for roll and pitch. The inner end is
attached to the aft door, and the forward end is
supported by the outboard end of the side jib. Two
hydraulically-driven discharge pumps comprise a Desmi
model DOP-250 in the forward tank and a DOP-160 in
the aft tank. Output is 0cm
3/hr-70cm
3/hr, and 0cm
3/hr-
30cm
3/hr, respectively. Discharge is through a standpipe
on the aft deck.
Haven Hornbill naturally has a number of tanks
onboard. She has two recovered oil tanks, the aft tank -
with a capacity of approximately 19,500litres - which
extends the full width of the hull and from bottom
plating to the underside of the deck aft of the engine
room. Her forward tank is located between the
workshop and the forward store and it extends the full
width of
the hull forward of
the oil recovery
compartments, and from her bottom plating to the
underside of the deck. This tank has a capacity of
approximately 54,500litres. Access to the tanks is by steel
hatches on deck.

K
ristiansand Fire Department took delivery of its new
9.7m fast response/rescue craft at the end of July
2002. Otra was built by Innovation A/S. The Innovation
aluminium hull features three watertight bulkheads, deep V
front section and a monohedron V in the aft section, with
wider stern section, and is designed for manoeuvrability,
good sea keeping, and is a stable work platform.
The Kristiansand Fire Department will use Otra for
diving and rescue operations, pleasure boat fires, accidents
and assistance, fires on the coastline and islands outside
Kristiansand where access with fire trucks is impossible,
and also as an ambulance as and when required.
Otra is fitted with a single Caterpillar engine, driving a
single UltraJet 305 waterjet via a ZF gearbox.
Prior to delivery, Jon Boye Anderson, owner of
Innovation A/S, carried out sea trials in Oslo Harbour with
members of the Oslo harbour, police, fire, and ambulance
authorities present. A top speed of 36.8knots at 5.5tonnes
was recorded on the GPS during trials, with an average
both ways over a 5km course of 35.5knots. Top speed in
light conditions is just below 40knots.
Excellent sea
keeping characteristics were demonstrated with dry decks,
good motion responses, and tight turning circles during full
speed.
During tender negotiations, noise levels were considered
to be a very important factor for the rescue personnel and
craft commander. They needed to be able to communicate
with the base and each other from the time the alarm goes
off until the accident or fire scene is reached. Noise level
in the thermally insulated wheelhouse at top speed is
around 70dB(A).
At the predicted 35knots operational speed the Fire
Department can reach the border of its response area in 10
minutes.
Other equipment fitted includes a bow ramp for
easy access on shore. Two large doors and a folding
platform on the starboard side provide easy recovery
of personnel from the sea. There is also a powerful
Zenon searchlight fitted to the roof
of
the
wheelhouse.

S
valbard is purpose built to operate in ice-covered
waters, and is able to work in a 1m thick, one year
old polar ice cap, and can break ice belts of up to 4m.
She is claimed to be the strongest icebreaker ever
built in Norway. Duties include patrolling Norway's
economic zone and the fisheries area around Jan
Meyen and Svalbard. During the winter, operating
areas will be the northern parts of the Barents Sea as
an 
icebreaker,
tug,
and 
helicopter-platform.
Additionally,
Svalbard
can work in polluted
environments and has substantial capacity for SAR
operations.
DNV has classified Svalbard to notation De-Ice,
thus she is fitted with a de-icing system with a
capacity of 1500kW. Heating cables, with a length of
17km, are attached to the decks and front of the hull
to avoid down-icing; a common problem for vessels
in arctic areas.
This ice-breaker has a helideck and hangar, and
always carries one helicopter when on patrol; whilst
there is actually space for two. The helicopter is an
important part of Svalbard and can operate from
distances quite far away from the vessel, and is seen as
an essential part of search and rescue operations.
Svalbard
uses 
diesel 
electric 
propulsion 
and contains four Bergen diesel BRG-8 engines,
with a combined output of 13,020kW. Two azipods,
each of
5000kW, propel Svalbard, classified to
Icebreaker Polar 10. This is similar to typical azipods
of 15MW in terms of power and can achieve the class
notation on redundant propulsion separated (RPS).
Harbour genset is a 1071kW Volvo Penta diesel
engine connected to a 1339kVA Stamford generator.
Svalbard's helicopter approaching system consists of
a light system, indicating height to the pilot on the
approach line. Lights illustrate a 3D picture of the
helideck with obstructions. Within this system is a
horizon bar that shows the pilot the true horizon
independent of Svalbard's movements. Svalbard is also
equipped to refuel airborne helicopters.
This vessel contains a high pressure ventilation
system featuring special air cleaners that allows the
vessel to remain in polluted areas for prolonged
lengths of time. This concept is based on re-
circulation of air, plus a continuous supply of fresh
oxygen via large air cleaners. Thus Svalbard can carry
out search and rescue in areas with nuclear, biological,
and chemical pollution. People can be rescued and
placed in safe onboard areas via locks and cleaning
stations. To protect crew from radiation, Svalbard is
equipped with exposure-measuring instruments.
The helifuel system allows Svalbard to operate as a
mobile platform offshore. A foam fire fighting system
on the helideck is supplied by Heien-Larsen, and a Fi-
Fi system from Kvaerner Eureka. The helideck can
be used without ground personnel due to gyro-
stabilised landing references and contour lighting.
Svalbard also has a data link to the Norwegian
Meteorological Institute for transferral of weather
reports.
Hydraulic equipment like hatches and deck
machinery were delivered by Hydrakraft and anchor
chains are supplied by Erling Hang. Windows are
from Marine Aluminium, watertight doors from
Winell, and fireproof doors from NorPro. Lanterns
were provided by Tranberg, and searchlight by
Norselight. International Maling’s paint was used to
protect Svalbard. Other manufactures used include
Vest-Davit which supplied the davit for the rescue
boat.
The accommodation area is separated into areas
with high pressure ventilation and gas-defence. Filters
in air inlets are immediately activated if Svalbard
enters chemically hazardous seas. Equipment includes
air and surface radars, coloured, black and white, and
infrared cameras, and sonar communication; allowing
personnel to document and evaluate any incidents
onboard.

T
hree Counties from Mustang Marine (Wales) Ltd is
an 18m fisheries research vessel designed by Chris
Baker, of Marine Data (IOM) Ltd, to meet the
requirements of
Eastern Sea Fisheries Joint
Committee, to provide research services to the
inshore fishery (6miles offshore) from Skegness to
Dovercourt, Suffolk. Three Counties is also available to
other agencies for survey work.
Specific requirements were for an aluminium
catamaran capable of carrying out operation in up to
sea state 5, but designed to continue passage making in
the North Sea up to sea state 7. Three Counties will
undertake passages of up to two days duration with
live aboard accommodation for a maximum period of
up to five days. In addition, she is designed for
repeated drying out, and to be able to operate onboard
systems while dry running the generators at 25% load.
The vessel is designed to meet MCA Code of Practice
for Small Workboats and Pilot boats Category 2, and
has a minimum service life of 10 years.
Three Counties is fitted with a comprehensive
electronics package with seabed discrimination and 3D
mapping capabilities,
which,
when taken in
conjunction with the onboard laboratory and deck
equipment, make it a very sophisticated small inshore
survey vessel. Wet and dry laboratories are set up to
receive clients systems with the minimum of
disruption to the vessel's onboard systems.
She is fitted with a substantial gantry 4tonne SWL
with the two off hydraulic deck winches (4.5tonnes) to
be used for handling the day grab for sampling. In
addition a 3tonne/m hydraulic knuckle boom is fitted
to assist in deployment of equipment and the vessel's
4m RHIB for example. In addition, the gantry is fitted
with a 5tonne slave winch for operation of small
sampling equipment. A further side gantry is fitted
with a 100kg slave winch for water sampling. Three
Counties is also fitted with two hydraulic anchor
winches. The hydraulic system is powered by variable
displacement pumps coupled to the PTO on the front
end of both main engines and the starboard genset.
She is also fitted with trolling valves to assist slow
speed operation when remaining on station while
sampling.
Three Counties is powered by twin Cummins N14
naturally aspirated diesel engines generating 525bhp at
2100rev/min, arranged in V drive lay out. The shafts
run in stern tubes fitted with grease and water-
lubricated bearings. At the inboard end, shafts are
fitted with keyed couplings mated to the gearboxes.
The stern gear arrangement is supplied by Kort
Propulsion, which also supplied twin KT 45 direct
drive hydraulic bow thrusters. Firemaster supplied
engine room protection, with a Micro-K fixed fire-
extinguishing system. Three Counties' epoxy paint
system and heavy duty non-slip deck coatings are from
Jotun Henry Clarke.
The vessel's steering system is supplied by Hamilton
Jet/Kobelt/Wagner hydraulic type, powered by an
electric power pack and hand hydraulic backup. A
400mm wheel is fitted at the helm position. The
engine control system is supplied by Kobelt and is a
three station electronic system with station select,
throttle, gearbox, and trolling controls.
Two gensets supply 220v AC which is complimented
by shore supply connection. These gensets are keel
cooled to permit running at 25% load while the vessel
is dry. The shore supply system is fitted with a
transformer to isolate the vessel from the shore. The
24v DC electrical system with two main battery banks
and is fully insulated with thermal magnetic circuit
breakers in both poles. The emergency bank is sited in
the wheelhouse. The principal distribution board is
mounted in the wheelhouse, and was designed and
installed by Mustang Marine.

G
emini Workboats, based in Colchester, UK,
launched and delivered its first FastCat design,
Xplorer, in March 2002. She was built for Portsmouth-
based firm Sea Trax, and will be used for survey and
film work, on locations all around the UK.
Xplorer features a toilet and galley area in the forward
starboard side, a double berth cabin in the forward
port side, and a single cabin each side of the extended
wheelhouse. Two 430hp Cummins 6 CTA engines are
fitted aft of these side cabins, and two gensets are
fitted in the aft holds.
On trials, Xplorer was reported to be highly
manoeuvrable with very low spray and wash, and
achieved a top speed of 27knots with a build weight of
12.5tonnes, and 26knots with 1tonne of ballast and 10
passengers aboard. At a cruising speed of 20knots
during her delivery trip, she only used an economical
60litres/hr of fuel.
During trials, inclination tests carried out with the
local MCA surveyor with 2tonnes placed upon the
port side, saw Xplorer only healing 1.7degs, and with
2tonnes placed across the stern, the transom was only
immersed 101mm.

T
he Delta 140 together with her 18m and 21m sister
craft are the results of a four year design and
development programme, utilising the most advanced
design and analytical processes to study: performance,
sea keeping, stability, durability, crew comfort, and
economy.
In-house naval architecture and design departments
utilise advanced 3D solid modelling design and
performance analysis computer software programmes.
The 100 Series has been subjected to performance
analysis carried out in sea states from calm to significant
wave heights of 7m. Acceleration and stability data
obtained was then downloaded to the accommodation
cabin simulator, to develop hull characteristics that
provide optimum crew and passenger comfort from
fatigue and motion sickness during extended operations.
For construction, a significant investment was made in
tooling of the 100 Series to enable the hulls to be
manufactured in GRP. Unlike many craft of this size,
GRP offers a unique combination of mechanical
properties, providing significant benefits to the operator,
such as: consistent hull profile accuracy during
production, light weight, high residual strength and wear
resistance, damage resistance, low maintenance, proven
long service life, and ease of repair without the need of
specialised facilities.
The inflatable collar of the Delta 140 is divided into 13
individual compartments, each of which is provided with
a pressure relief and inflation valve. The 140 collar is
mechanically attached to the hull, enabling a complete
collar change to be performed in four hours without the
need for specialised tools. The collar is manufactured
from high performance Hypalon/Neoprene blended
materials to provide high mechanical strength, tear
resistance, and high wear resistance. The collar also
incorporates a number of protection features to provide
extended service life.
As with all Delta craft, the collar is designed to increase
the performance of the craft in a number of ways. It is
not use the collar for primary buoyancy. This provides a
number of benefits during operation of the craft,
including the fact that the craft can remain fully
operational in the unlikely event of the collar being
damaged, it provides an additional safety margin for crew
and passengers, it has improving fuel consumption, there
is reduced wear on the collar, and improving spray
control providing a dryer ride.
As sea conditions deteriorate the collar starts to play an
interactive role, as and when required. It absorbs wave
energy, and in extreme conditions the collar will provide
complete secondary buoyancy as required. It also enables
the craft to operate safely in conditions where larger craft
would have difficulty and provides a high degree of
safety for crew and passengers. The craft can be kept on
a maximum state of readiness, which allows safe pursuit
and boarding operations, and this reduces the risk of
damage to the craft when going alongside or being driven
by weather against hazardous structures.

A
fter more than 10 years developing and building
Combat Boat 90 H in various forms,
Dockstavarvet has now completed the final phase in
the development of a new and faster adapted patrol
boat 
for 
coastguard,
police,
and 
customs
surveillance activities. This new boat is based on the
successful Combat Boat 90 concept, which by the
end of 2002 had been sold in more than 200 units
to countries such as Norway, Denmark, Greece,
Malaysia, Mexico, and Sweden.
The new patrol boat, given type designation IC 
15 M, is based on the further development of
the Combat Boat 90 H concept modified 
for purposes other than troop transportation.
The hull lacks a bow ramp and the wheelhouse 
has 
been 
moved 
astern,
resulting 
in 
improved comfort for those working onboard on 
the open sea. Below deck, a great deal of work 
has gone into fitting out the vessel in a practical
and appropriate manner for a crew of
four 
men. Unlike Combat Boat 90 H, which is based 
on troop transport, the new boat is built for
working onboard during long patrols. As before, it
will be possible for Enforcer 11 to be specially
equipped to meet individual requirements of each
customer 
in 
terms 
of
navigation 
and
communications equipment and various types of
sensors.
The water jet unit provides the same degree of
manoeuvrability as before but the centrifugal
couplings that connect at 800rev/min have been
replaced with specially designed couplings that can
be switched off to allow the user to manoeuvre the
boat at idling rev/min.
The displacement and size of the vessel is largely
the same as before,
ie,
with a length of
approximately 
16m 
and 
displacement 
of
approximately 18tonnes.
The draught is still 
slightly less than 1m. The major difference is 
in the functionality of
the vessel;
with the
wheelhouse located astern and a conventional 
stem, Enforcer 11 can maintain higher speeds on open
sea.
The location of the wheelhouse aft of midship
gives increased comfort to the crew and visibility is
excellent around the horizon, despite the low profile.
Accommodation is arranged for a crew of four with
two single cabins, one double cabin, pantry, mess-
room and toilet.

esign and outfit flexibility is reportedly the key
to a new generation of offshore patrol vessels
developed 
by 
Vosper 
Thornycroft 
(VT)
Shipbuilding for both the UK and overseas markets.
An initial order of three 80m ships for the Royal
Navy will provide the platform for VT Shipbuilding
to demonstrate that the task of monitoring the
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) can be performed
by an efficient and affordable vessel without the
need to employ the full capability of a warship.
This trio of Royal Navy ships has been procured
under a unique five-year charter agreement, but the
cost effectiveness of the design means that it should
fall within the budget of most developed navies.
The new RN ships will replace five smaller Island
class ships and will be available for sea-going
operations over a greater period each year, providing
the MoD with very significant cost savings.
HMS Tyne, was accepted by the RN in November
2002, and her sister ships, HMS Severn and HMS
Mersey, utilise a double chine hull form and have
been designed by VT to provide improved
seakeeping performance compared to the Royal
Navy's current offshore patrol vessels and a much
higher grade of accommodation. Modular cabins
pre-fabricated and outfitted by VT are single or two-
berth and have en-suite facilities.
The ships will have state-of-the-art machinery
control systems supplied by VT Controls and the
latest navigation and communication systems. They
will also carry two VT Halmatic Pacific 22 MkII
boarding and rescue boats each with dedicated
single-man operation davits and RIB tracking
systems.
One of the major assets of the ship is a large
working deck which can accommodate up to seven
TEU containers,
enabling the ship to carry 
elements such as additional stores, workshops,
minecountermeasure support equipment, a diving
recompression chamber or medical facilities.
Alternatively, the deck can be used to carry small
vehicles or special forces equipment.
Although the ships' primary role is enforcement of
national and EU fisheries legislation within British
fishery limits, they will have the flexibility to conduct
a 
variety 
of
other 
operations,
including
environmental protection work around the coast of
the UK. Export versions of the ship can also be
deployed in a wide range of operational scenarios
linked to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
These include assisting civilian authorities in case of
disaster relief, anti-pollution, firefighting, rescue
work, or interception. A heavy-duty cargo crane with
a 25tonnes capacity is therefore fitted to handle
standard containers.
In addition, the design has the flexibility to
increase the overall length by means of a midship
section to accommodate additional crew, facilities
and/or equipment.
To address cost effectiveness further, measures
have been taken to simplify construction, facilitating
in-country build for those countries with either an
established or developing shipbuilding capability.
The baseline export vessel design includes a flight
deck for land-based small/medium helicopters and
aviation facilities can be enhanced to provide storage
and maintenance facilities.

amen Stan Patrol 2706, P41, was handed over to
the Netherlands' Police Forces (KLPD) in May
2002. P41 is a seagoing patrol vessel operating on the
Westerschelde river, with Vlissingen as homeport.
One of the tender requirements was a speed of
25knots, and a high standard of seakeeping was
stipulated in order to enhance crew comfort during
sea patrols.
Hull lines have been carefully designed in close
cooperation with the Delft Technical University. In the
preliminary design phase particular attention was given
to the reduction of noise levels in accommodation
areas. This has been achieved by placing the
superstructure on resilient mounts, resulting in a low
noise level of 56dB(A) at full speed.
P41 and sister P42 are the first vessels in a series of
five that will be delivered to KLPD this year and next
year. All vessels will be stationed along The
Netherlands' coastline. The vessels have been designed
for carrying out several police and patrol tasks. The
patrol area includes the Westerschelde river, the
Waddenzee, and most large seaports, with exception
of the port of Rotterdam. The vessels comply with
the requirements of
the Netherlands' Shipping
Inspectorate (NSI) for an action radius of 15nm off
the coast, at a maximum wind speed of Beaufort 7.
The design concept is based on proven techniques
which have already been implemented in smaller
Damen Stan Patrol 1800 class vessels, of which 13
have been delivered between 1996 and 2002. An
important difference from the Stan Patrol 1800 is the
special attention that has been paid to the vessel's
seakeeping characteristics. The bow section of the
vessel, for instance, has been adapted for that purpose.
The first technical trials at sea under bad weather
conditions were very promising and owner and crew
were reportedly very pleased with the vessel. The
patrol vessel has been built to the rules of Bureau
Veritas, class notation: I 3/3 E* Light Ship/Fast Police
Boat Coastal Waters, MACH.
Built under survey of Bureau Veritas, the patrol
vessel features an aluminium hull. The deckhouse has
been built separately and is mounted with a flexible
joint to the hull. Due to the application of a flexible
wheelhouse, and a number of other noise reducing
measures, the sound level has been limited down to
56dB(A).
The aftbody is fitted with propeller tunnels and a
safety rail has been fitted around wheelhouse and
foredeck. Fendering consists of a 120mm thick
rubbylene rubber and polyethylene composite joined
to the hull with welded pins. In order to pass low-
hanging overhead obstacles, such as bridges, the mast
can be lowered hydraulically by remote control.
Propulsion is by two Caterpillar 3412E TTA marine
diesel engines,
each developing 2230bhp at
2300rev/min. The main engines are electronically
controlled and fully comply with the latest
requirements with regard to IMO's exhaust gas
emissions directive. These engines are fitted with ZF
reduction gearboxes, each featuring a trolling valve for
low speed operations. Propulsors consist of high skew
five-bladed propellers and directional control is with a
hydraulic steering engine featuring a 24V electric
backup pump. Manoeuvrability is enhanced by a 37kW
Promac FP 50/430 bowthruster unit, which is
powered via a main engine driven hydraulic load
sensing pump.

esigned by Derecktor Shipyards, with structural
design and lofting subcontracted to Nigel Gee
and Associates, America is the new addition to the Fire
Island Ferries fleet. America is the first vessel delivered
by Derecktor's new Bridgeport, Connecticut facility -
Derecktor Shipyards Conn, LLC.
The vessel, a USCG Subchapter T vessel, 25.9m x
7.0m, is designed and certified for joint purpose of
cargo carrier and passenger vessel. She has a hard-
chined hull form and a forward enclosed
superstructure for dry cargo storage and passenger
seating. The superstructure incorporates sliding doors
on port and starboard sides and aft to the cargo deck.
A raised pilothouse on the top deck provides 360deg
visibility.
America has capacity for payload of 36tonnes cargo
or 149 passengers.
The design was driven by a
requirement for carriage of a 36tonne concrete mixer,
thus the deck and longitudinal structure of the vessel
are developed with heavy plating and deep girders to
meet this requirement.
Loading of
cargo is assisted by hydraulically
powered deck crane and transom ramp. A Palfinger
PK12080MA crane, rated at 113.8kNm maximum
lifting moment, is located on the cargo deck to port.
Loading of trucks and other vehicles is accomplished
via stern mounted, hydraulically actuated ramp. A spud
well is provided on the port side to stabilise the vessel
when transom is dockside.
Powered by two Series 60, Detroit Diesel Corp, keel-
cooled engines, each rated at 298kW (400bhp)
continuous duty at 1800rev/min, the vessel is capable
of 13knots fully loaded, and 16knots light.
The
engines are each mated to a Twin Disc 5114SC
gearbox with 2.5:1 ratio.
Cowl silencers are
incorporated in the dry exhaust system for passenger
and crew comfort.
Dual Austral Compuquad
propellers of
914mm diameter, 864mm pitch,
complete the propulsion package.
The vessel utilises a 24VDC electrical system which
consists of one house and one ship service battery
bank, of two Rolls 12 HHG 8D 12VDC batteries
each, and two main engine driven Delco Remy
100amp alternators. A Newmar converter provides
12VDC for electronics. A 125VAC, 50A, shore power
receptacle is used for battery charging (Sentry) and
main engine block heaters.
Navigation electronics consist of a Furuno FR7112
radar with 1.83m antenna, Furuno GP36 GPS,
Standard LH-5 Loudhailer, and two VHF radios.
Propulsion control system is DDEC, with separate
control heads for each engine.
Engine PTOs drive Oilgear hydraulic pump for deck
crane and loading ramp power and Sea Star hydraulic
pump for steering. Bilge and fire pumps are also
powered by engine PTOs. Bilge and fire mains are
also interconnected for back-up capability. Two
750gallon (US) fuel tanks are provided. Cabin heating
is provided utilising engine waste heat and a hot water
heating loop. Heatercraft heater units are provided in
the main cabin and the pilothouse, for cold weather
operation.

S
hetland Islands Council took delivery this year of
Linga a new ro-ro/passenger ferry, built by
Stocznia Polnocna - Northern Shipyard, located in
Gdansk, Poland under Yard Number B 597/1. The
basic design was prepared by Nigel Gee and
Associates, Southampton, UK on behalf of the
Council, and then developed by Vik Sandvik Poland
as part of the overall design and build contract with
Northern Shipyard.
Linga
is of
welded steel
construction with her wheelhouse made of
aluminum alloys.
Linga was designed for the Inter-Island Ferry route
between Laxo (Shetland mainland) and Symbister
(Whalsay). The vessel is classified by Lloyd's Register
of Shipping under class notation X100 A1 LMC
UMS Roll-on/Roll-off Passenger/Vehicle Ferry,
Laxo to Symbister Service. The vessel has been
designed and constructed to meet the requirements
of the European Directive 98/18/EC on Safety
Rules and Standards for Passenger Ships, Class EU B.
The vessel is capable of carrying a maximum
complement of 95 passengers and five crew. The
vehicle deck is designed to carry a mixture of either
16 cars, 2 x 44tonne HGV vehicles plus 10 cars, or
many combinations of commercial and domestic
vehicles in three lanes, with the centre lane being
designated especially for trucks and HGV's. The
passenger accommodation is arranged at both sides
of the vessel, one deck above vehicle deck, with total
seating for 95 passengers (85 seated at the tables and
the others on jump seats).
There is also a 
passenger lift for disabled persons located 
between the vehicle deck and the starboard passenger
saloon.
The vessel is fitted with diesel electric propulsion
plant consisting of three Mitsubishi S6R2 - MPTKF
diesel generator sets driving two Kamewa
Aquamaster US601CRP thrusters with one of the
generators being on permanent standby, thus
providing 50% redundancy within the vessels
generating capacity. This feature, along with one
additional spare aft thruster (being stored ashore)
and the convenient access to gensets and aft
thrusters, allows for reliability and ability to maintain
service even if components fail within the propulsion
system. The diesel engines are rated at 640kW at
1500rev/min, with generator output of 612kW
(765kVA) at 1500rev/min each. An emergency
generator set has enough capacity to supply essential
services in the event of all three main gensets failing.
Additionally two 190kW Kamewa tunnel bow
thrusters, electrically driven, are fitted in the fore part
of the hull.
Linga has a range of fire fighting equipment
including Hi-Fog and drencher systems. The Hi-Fog
system protects passenger and crew accommodation,
engine room, engine control room and navigation
bridge, while the independently supplied drencher
system protects the vehicle deck. Lifesaving and
rescue equipment comprises of
two marine
evacuation systems, one in each of the passenger
saloons, and a FRC/davit system on the bridge deck.
As a result of
good cooperation during
construction of
Linga, Northern Shipyard was
awarded an order for building, fitting out, and supply
of another ferry for Shetland Islands Council. The
new, 35.50m long general purpose ferry should be
delivered at the end of April 2003.

his foilmaster design is an economically-sized
passenger only vessel, and is the latest and most
updated model of a long series of hydrofoils from
Rodriquez Cantieri Navali. Natalie M is capable of
40knots for 250 passengers from only 4000kW, and the
builders believe her to be the most economical fast
ferry available. She is made from light alloy aluminium.
This foilmaster ferry, unlike other vessels, uses very
low engine power to reach very high speeds. Maximum
power of the ferry is in fact only used to allow her to
get out of the water, she runs at 38knots at 95% MCR.
When simply running, Natalie M needs only 60% of
total engine power to run on the foils. This not only
reduces fuel consumption,
but also reduces
maintenance intervals of the engines. This Foilmaster
is designed for maximised efficiency and economy, so
FP propulsion was chosen.
The design and manufacture of Natalie M's foils was
the responsibility of Rodriquez Marine Systems, a
wholly owned division of Rodriquez Cantieri Navali.
These foils are hydrodynamically optimised to reduce
drag to a minimum and provide maximum lift at low
speed, approximately 14knots. They also incorporate
trim tabs in the vertical skegs for steering, as well as in
the horizontal plane for anti-pitch/roll control. By using
the latest software, combined with very fast acting
hydraulic systems and solenoids, the ride quality of
Natalie M is claimed to be far superior than vessels of a
similar size.

uilt for Expo 02, the Swiss National Exhibition,
New York and six other Iris cats were used for
transporting visitors between various lakeside venues.
New York is a 42.77m-long Iris 6.2 ship, and is
equipped with passenger modules offering a total
capacity of 400, with a closed forward passenger
lounge 
and 
an 
aft 
module 
giving 
closed
accommodation below and an open deck above. She is
powered by two 2320kW MTU 4000 series engines
driving MJP 750DD waterjets, which give a maximum
speed of 40knots, representing a fully-loaded service
speed of 35knots. The 10,000litre fuel capacity allows
for 10-12 hours of operation.
New York is a twin-hull platform, with hulls linked by
three aluminium beams and a command head grouping
together all propulsion,
steering,
safety,
and
transmission equipment. Thus New York is safe - as all
energy spaces are in the hulls and are insulated from
passenger lounges; adaptable into different types of
service; and she is transportable to places usually
inaccessible to monoblock vessels.
Her hull moulded in composite materials, and is of
semi-wave piercing format with fine bows, for low fuel
consumption, she has good seakeeping qualities in
wave heights up to 2.5m, has and low wash
characteristics. New York's hull shape enables her to
maintain full speed in short chop of up to 1.5m.
Interiors have been designed by Olivier Flahault and
lounges are claimed to be inviting and open. The
design is ergonomic and colourful, whilst practical-
there are a number of heavy luggage stowage areas
close to access points.

ith its distinctive 'Blue Cat' livery, The Cat is a
98m fast ferry. She is longer on the waterline
than Bay Ferries' earlier fast craft, the 91m Incat 046,
and offers a substantial 50% more deadweight. The
Cat can carry 900 passengers and 267 cars, or fewer
cars plus heavy freight vehicles; an increase of 11%
in car capacity and a very large increase in freight
capacity.
The passenger area of this ferry is located on one
deck. It has three lounge areas along the length, and
each lounge features its own style of seating, colour
scheme, and facilities. The midships lounge is the
focal point for many onboard activities, being
surrounded by a shop, kiosk, and onboard seating area
where passengers can sit in tub-style seats in clusters
around circular tables, or outboard of planter boxes
in recliner-style lounge seating. Her most striking
feature is the ceiling skylight.
The forward lounge provides a panoramic 300deg
view of the horizon via sweeping tinted windows, and
contains a service centre equipped with food and
beverage serving facilities. Passengers travelling with
cars enter The Cat from the vehicle deck via port and
starboard internal stairs featuring overhead skylight
windows and tiled motif flooring, or by external stairs
into the aft lounge. This aft lounge contains a mixture
of seating and tables, and surrounds the Mizzen Bar.
Access to The Cat for disabled passengers has been
carefully considered in its design. A ramp for the
forward vehicle deck, plus a lift at the aft end of the
ship aids entry; whilst passengers with disabilities can
park adjacent to the vehicle access door, away from
the general movement of cars on the main vehicle
deck, so can move safely into the passenger cabin.
Passengers travelling without cars enter the ship
through large side entry doors into the forward
lounge.
Incat is determined to dominate the fast ferry
market for fast freight, consequently The Cat's vehicle
decks offer a total of 380 truck lane metres at 3.1m
wide x 4.3m clear height, and 360 car lane metres at
2.3m wide x 2.1m high. Suitable for heavy road
transport vehicles, the main vehicle deck also benefits
from unrestricted heights for 6m and an unobstructed
width of 18m at the stern.
The fitting of nine hoistable mezzanine vehicle
decks gives the operator flexibility to carry 267 cars
and no heavy vehicles, or 12 road freight trailers with
180 cars, or 24 road freight trailers with 90 cars, whilst
still offering the headroom needed by oversize freight
vehicles when raised.
An easy-stow hydraulically operated passenger lift
provides swift access from the aft end of the vehicle
deck to the external observation deck. When in the
upper position, the ability to fold the lift enclosure
ensures unhindered movement of vehicles.
The Cat is powered by four Ruston 20RK270
medium-speed diesels, developing in excess of
28,000kW. These engines drive transom-mounted
steerable Lips 120E waterjets via Reintjes VLJ6831
gearboxes. All four waterjets are configured for
steering and reversing, while an independent hydraulic
system in each hull covers the steering and reverse
functions.
The Marine Dynamics/Incat ride control system
consisting of transom-mounted trim tabs and a
retractable bow T-foil further improves sea keeping
qualities.
These, combined with a new hull form
featuring longer outer bows, fuller midship sections,
stern skeglets, and improved centre bow clearances,
means motion sickness incidence has been reduced by
up to 40% in higher seas states by reducing pitch, roll,
and heave.
The Cat features the revolutionary retractable T-foil
located at the aft end of the centre bow. Developed
jointly by Incat and Maritime Dynamics, the foil
retracts out of the water and behind the centre bow
when not in use. When sea conditions are calm, the
foil is retracted, increasing vessel speed and reducing
the possibility of damage by submerged objects. In
the event of an object strike while the foil is in use, it
will retract immediately. All mechanical and hydraulic
components are above the water allowing servicing to
taken place while the vessel is afloat.

MMA is a newly designed 14.95m fish farm
workboat,
from Macduff
Ship Design,
of
Grampian, Scotland, which has been created for
carrying and anchor-handling duties. She has been built
for Aquascot, a company that are involved in the
sustainable farming of salmon, sea-grown trout, and
turbot, and will operate at the company's site on the Isle
of Gigha, Scotland.
Macduff
Ship Design produced the cutting
information for this vessel as a computer file, enabling a
kit of parts to be produced by Macduff Profilers.
The conservatively-rated main engine, a Mermaid
Mistral, is a six-cylinder, turbocharged heavy duty marine
diesel engine and is based on the highly reliable Ford
'Dover' series industrial engine. This features a specially
matched water-cooled turbo-charger that enables low
fuel consumption to be achieved. These two diesel
engines are each rated at 169bp at 2500rev/min, driving
Teignbridge 900mm handled propellers through PRM
4:1 reduction ratio gearboxes. A PTO on one gearbox
provides hydraulic power for a Palfinger carne on the
starboard deck, and a capstan to port.
Interestingly, there are two options for fish storage,
catch can either be carried in a vivier tank, or stored in
tubs as deck cargo.

S
hanmhari is the newly designed Typhoon 38 from
Cygnus Marine, based in Cornwall, for Bressay
Salmon of the Shetland Isles. This 11.7m vessel is a
fast fish-farm workboat.
She is powered by a single Scania DS12 575hp to give
a maximum speed of over 20knots, while the engine is
located slightly forward of midship, to allow space for
a removable 5tonne capacity aluminium hopper/feed
blower system.
A Palfinger hydraulic crane is located aft, to load on
the feed bags from the quayside, ensuring self-
sufficiency, and a rapid turn-around time for the
operator. The twin unit hydraulic pump system also
drives a capstan back aft, for lines and anchor handling.
Three berths and a toilet compartment are located in
the fore cabin, with crew dinette, galley, and helm
position in the wheelhouse. In addition to the usual
electronics, is an underwater video set to monitor
conditions in cages during feeding.
The Typhoon design has proved to be a remarkable
success story since the original 10.3m version was
launched at the Southampton Boat Show in 2001, with
a 10m now fishing in Exmouth, another about to be
launched as a fishing vessel in Skye, a 10.3m nearly
completed in Belgium, and one 10m and two 12.8m
versions being built in Ireland, along with many other
orders reportedly under negotiation.

T
his vessel is Safehaven Marine's first new
Interceptor 42 design.
She has been built for
owner Martin Oliver, and named True Light of the
Claddagh after his grandfather's famous boat of the
region. The original True Light was the last fishing
boat to fish commercially under sail in Galway, and
possibly the last in Ireland. This new vessel
however, is operating as an angling charter boat
during the summer moths, whilst in winter acts as a
commercial fishing vessel in Jersey.
True Light of the Claddagh is to be licensed as a Class
6 passenger boat to operate out of Galway. She has
been designed to conform to the stringent stability
and safety requirements of this class of vessel, and
will be capable of carrying 30 passengers. As well as
this, she will operate alternately as a sea angling
charter vessel, and survey craft, her design being
such that she can operate successfully in a number of
roles.
This vessel's hull is based on the Deep V 
hull design of
the others in the Interceptor 
range,
but True Light of
the Claddagh
has 
been developed into what is claimed is a unique 
twin reverse chine design, which offers significant
seakeeping 
and 
performance 
advantages 
over conventional craft.
Her wide beam makes
this vessel very stable with a high GM and 
an impressive GZ curve. Her deep, full length 
keel provides directional stability as well as 
good attitude to the wind in drift.
It also 
provides protection to the stern gear and allows 
for a larger diameter propeller to be turned in 
big 
single 
engine 
installations 
for 
maxi-
mum economy, an important issue with today's
rising fuel costs. True Light of
the Claddagh's
Deep V section ensures that she can maintain 
speed into steep head seas without slamming 
and her large freeboard means decks are 
always dry. This is an alternative to the twin screw
version otherwise depicted.
True Light of the Claddagh has been fitted out to a
very high standard for a commercial vessel, with a
large main cabin with seating for 10 people, as 
well as galley, and cooking facilities. Her fore cabin
has a large double berth and shower/heads
compartment.
Due to the new popularity of deep sea big game
fishing, this vessel was fitted with a fly bridge that
gives the panoramic visibility that this type of
fishing requires.
She is powered by a pair of
Caterpillar 3126 engines rated at 300hp each, which
give a maximum speed of 24knots, and a fast
cruising speed of 18knots-19knots on a lightship
displacement of 10,000kg.

he anchor handling towing supply vessel
UT719-T, Anglian Princess, was designed by
Rolls-Royce Marine A/S, Norway, to accommodate
the demands of the offshore industry. Equipped for
towing and anchor handling duties, this vessel also
has a range of
versatile capabilities; such as
functioning as a stand-by rescue vessel with fire
fighting and ROV services, as well as a cargo
transportation vessel,
used for loading and
unloading of cargo to offshore rigs and production
platforms.
Anglian Princess not only meets the classification
criteria of Lloyd's Register, +100A1, +LMC, UMS,
Tug, Offshore Supply Ship, Fire-fighting Ship I
(2400m
3/h), but also complies with the requirements
of the Marine & Coastguard Agency. She will be
flying the British flag with respect to the latest rules
and regulations from SOLAS 1974 with amendments
in force.
Anglian Princess has a propulsion unit that consists
of two 6000kW Wärtsilä Vasa main engine coupling,
two 6000kW 4-bladed Ulstein Propeller in Kort
Nozzles, at a speed of 135rev/min. With a trial
speed of approximately 17knots at 4m draught,
economic speed of 12knots-13knots, and a bollard
pull of 180tonnes at 100% MCR, these standards
clearly emphasis the demands and capabilities of a
modern coast guard vessel.
The wheelhouse of the vessel is built with a
commanding and unrestricted view, complementing
up to 20 crew with accommodation in 17 cabins. The
navigation equipment is assembled from the latest
technology with proven records on stability and
functionality. This entire infrastructure of Anglian
Princess is built in mind to function in all weather
conditions, whilst ensuring efficiency and comfort
for both crew and vessel.

T
his year Pan-United Shipyard delivered a 66.6m
workboat, Armada Salman, to Bumi Armada
Navigation. This company is reportedly the biggest
offshore fleet operator in Malaysia, managing more
than 33 vessels of various categories in Malaysia and
Brunei, and Armada Salman is believed to be 
under contract to Brunei Shell Petroleum Company.
The 
shipbuilding 
contract 
was 
awarded 
to 
Pan-United Shipyard in June 2001 and was 
duly 
completed 
within 
13 
months.
Armada 
Salman was commissioned to replace another vessel,
Sirocco.
Armada Salman is considered a new custom-made
support vessel for Brunei Shell's wireline and wellhead
maintenance activities. Its technical well services
section has been using a vessel to support campaign-
type operations in offshore fields since 1999.
This type of operations was, for the first two years,
performed on a trial basis, in order to evaluate the
feasibility and the economics. It became clear early on
however, that this method of executing the operations
was ideal, both from a human and economical point of
view. With the commissioning of Armada Salman,
crews will now spend their working-day hours in the
field and return 'home' after work to the vessel. This
mode of operating on a large scale reduces daily travel
risks to the work site, while at the same time increasing
the level of productivity at work.
The vessel is built in accordance to American Bureau
of Shipping requirements with a four point mooring
system and speeds of
above 12knots.
The
accommodation block meeting the offshore platform
requirements can house up to 135 men. The vessel has
a wide beam of 20m that provides a larger working deck
and was installed with a large offshore crane.

K
leven Verft in Norway this year handed over an
advanced platform supply vessel to Havila
Supply Ships A/S. Havila Tampen has been taken on
long term charter by Norsk Hydro and will work in
the North Sea. The design selected is the UT745E
from Rolls-Royce; which is the diesel electric
version of the popular UT745 PSV. It incorporates
azimuth thrusters for main propulsion and is built
to DP2 class and DNV Clean and Comf-C3
notation.
Kleven shipyard in Ulsteinvik, part of the Kleven
Maritime Group, has long experience in building
offshore service vessels of many designs and types.
To gain some advantage from constructing steelwork
in lower cost countries, many of the hull modules
were built in Poland. Others were made at the yard's
own steelwork facility at Rovde in west Norway, and
sections were taken to Ulsteinvik for early outfitting
before final assembly.
Havila's new vessel is 88.6m long, and has a
deadweight of about 3500tonnes when drawing
5.6m, of which up to 2800tonnes can be taken on
the 990m
2 working deck. Tank layout and capacities
are optimised for the Hydro contract and include
1500m
3 of ballast/drillwater, 1100m
3 of fuel, 730m
3
of fresh water, 400m
3 of dry bulk cargo, and
substantial tankage for base oil, liquid mud, brine,
methanol, and slops.
Four 
Caterpillar 
3516TA 
main 
engines 
each provide 1901kW, 2 x 2500kW of
which 
goes to the ABB propulsion motors,
giving 
the vessel a trial speed of 15.4knots on a draught 
of 3.7m.
Rolls-Royce supplied an equipment package
including the Ulstein Aquamaster USL305 main
thrusters with 3.2m diameter open water propellers
and the 883kW super silent forward tunnel thruster.
As part of the contract, the main thrusters will be
replaced by the new Rolls-Royce Azipull azimuth
thrusters with pulling propellers when these are
released for offshore applications.
As reflected in the classification notation, Havila
Tampen is fitted for DYNPOS AUTR dynamic
positioning and has a high standard of comfort and
quietness. Accommodation is provided for 16 people
in 14 cabins.

W
HEN Aquaria Shipping had to increase the size
of
its oil industry support vessels it
commissioned Strategic Marine Pty Ltd, in Western
Australia, to build the vessel best suited to a very
stringent specification and remote operational
requirements. PT Aquaria Shipping is an Indonesian
company managed by Danish company Svitzer
Wijsmuller. Worldwide, this company has more than
220 vessels, including a fleet of 15 crew utility boats in
South East Asia.
The result is a fleet of three 30m work boats capable
of carrying large amounts (up to 40tonnes) of deck
cargo on a timber sheathed deck and transporting crews
to and from oil platforms in passenger ferry comfort.
To achieve these results, the operator and designer,
Strategic Marine and Southerly Design of Dongara,
Western Australia, worked closely to produce the
optimum vessel that would also be economical and
reliable in service, and capable of meeting speed
requirements to achieve the response times set by the
oil platform operators. The vessels, Kaltim Maju, Kaltin
Makmur, and Kaltim Mekar have a top speed of 28knots,
can carry 50 passengers, 40tonnes of cargo, and have
crew accommodation for six people. Operating out of
Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, these vessels will be used
to transport rig, production crew, and equipment to and
from oil and gas platforms and rigs in the Makassar
Strait for energy company Unocal Indonesia.
While exploration rigs are typically staffed with
workers on extended stays, a substantial percentage of
production platform workers in the Makassar Strait do
12hour shifts, returning to their base at the conclusion
of each shift. These new crew-boats will transport the
day workers from the mainland to the rigs as well as
transporting workers, equipment, and spares, between
rigs and platforms.
The main deck passenger cabin is fitted out to ferry
standard with reclining aircraft style seating for 50
people, and is fitted with tropical standard air-
conditioning and a video and audio entertainment
system. Safety of passengers and crew is catered for by
a fully monitored fire detection system, the provision of
inflatable life-rafts, and a GMDSS communications
system with EPIRB and SART location transponders.
The bridge, located on the upper level, has all-round
vision and is fitted with two control stations - the main
helm station facing forward, with the second station
facing aft. The aft control station is used when the boat
is manoeuvring to and from the platforms. Loading and
offloading of crew and gear is traditionally done with
the boat stern-to at the rig platforms, so in port the
transom is left open (protected by removable chains)
for this purpose.
Air-conditioned crew accommodation for six, in three
two-bed cabins, a lounge, a galley and bathroom are
located below decks providing the crew with 'motel'
style accommodation for their tours onboard. Aft of
the accommodation is a plant room and aft of that is
the main engine room. A tank area and the tiller flat
complete the below deck compartments.
Kaltim Maju is constructed out of low-maintenance
aluminium and all seawater piping is of stainless steel.
The cargo deck is covered with a protective layer of
thick marine pine planks which protect the structure
from shock loads during cargo handling and minimise
the possibility of cargo sliding. Planking can be easily
removed to gain access to the engine room located in
the centre of the vessel. Cargo deck capacity is
2tonnes/m
2.
She is powered by three Caterpillar 3412E diesel
engines rated at 925bhp at 2100rev/min driving three
aluminium bronze FP propellers through Reintjes
reverse 
reduction 
gearboxes.
Care 
for 
the
environment has been a major factor in the design
and outfitting, and is catered for with the inclusion of
an oily water separator,
and a Hanmann
Wassertechnik MINI L sewage treatment plant, along
with the allocation of tank space to store the by-
products of both systems until they can be disposed
of safely ashore.

T
ulpar has been designed to operate as an all-
round, multipurpose support vessel for AGIP
KCO's exploration and exploitation works in the
Kashagan field in the Khazakstan sector of the
north Caspian Sea. The waters in this part of the
Caspian are extremely shallow, with a normal depth
of approximately 3m. Air temperature range is
between -30
oC in winter to +40
oC in summer.
In
winter, the region of operation is prone to ice sheets
up to 1m thick - these conditions make it an
extremely demanding operational environment.
The vessel's primary role is to afford an ice
management and safety standby capability to the
rigs performing exploration and production roles
in the field, the vessel is accordingly classed to
DNV ICE 1A*F. Primary thrust is provided
through two stern Schottel SRP 2020 ICE 05
azimuthing thrusters, each delivering 2MW of
power. Two forward Schottel SPJ220 pump jets of
0.85MW each compliment these units. To provide
maximum manoeuvrability all four of the vessel's
thrusters are independently controlled through
360degs. This thruster configuration, combined
with a specially designed shallow water ice breaking
bow, affords the vessel the ability to break sheet ice
in excess of 0.7m thick whilst moving ahead. The
vessel also has an astern ice management mode
using the 'mill washing' technique. In this mode,
the vessel is capable of milling heavy ice and
disintegrating consolidated ice rubble mounds
many metres thick at a rate of up to 30,000tonnes
per hour.
The vessel has been designed to fully comply
with the rules and regulations of UKOOA 120B
and has the necessary layout for the safe and
efficient recovery of 120 survivors.
All recovery
operations can be monitored from a rescue
coordination zone on the bridge, from where any
part of the process can be viewed through direct
line of sight and video surveillance cameras.
Given that the fields where the vessel is to penetrate
are prone to hydrogen sulphide (H2S) escapes, the vessel
has been fitted with an H2S alarm system. On detection
of gas, this alarm shuts down the inlet vents to the
accommodation and re-routes all supply air through
scrubbers to give a clean supply to the accommodation
citadel. Overpressure ensures that no harmful gas enters
the accommodation.
Under certain wind conditions experienced in the
vessel's designated area of operation, sea levels can drop
by up to 1m in a very short space of time, leading to the
potential for vessels to become grounded through
reduction of water depth. In order to safe guard the
crew under these conditions, Tulpar's emergency
generator is designed to provide essential services
including heating.
The vessel is designed to provide a deadweight
capacity of approximately 500tonnes at her minimum
operating draught of 2.5m, allowing her to remain on
station for 30 days. This deadweight capacity rises to
3000tonnes at the vessel's maximum operating draught
of 4m.
Given the environmental sensitivity of the region in
which the vessel is to operate, zero dumping tanks are
also provided for the purpose of both removing waste
from the rigs and preventing discharge from the vessel.
One of the more interesting design challenges posed
was the need to maximise the vessel's beam in order to
generate the desired deadweight at the minimum
operating draught, with the resultant beam exceeding
that permitted for transit through the Russian canal
system required for entry into the Caspian. The solution
generated by BMT was to design the vessel with all
systems contained within a central 16m barge, with form
given to the hull through side hull extensions to be fitted
once the vessel reached the Caspian.
