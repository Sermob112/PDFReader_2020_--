F
RENCH giant CMA CGM currently operates
around 140 container ships on its worldwide
services, many of
them chartered from, mainly
German, owners specialising in servicing this niche
market with vessels of varying sizes to suit a particular
operator's requirements. Peter Döhle is one such
company and a number of its newbuildings have
This market has also caught the eye of a shipbuilding
industry which has many designs readily available to suit
owners' and operators' needs, or else capable of quick
modification to do so. China Shipbuilding is a typical
example of a builder specialising in this market, with a
capacity, and also incorporating other changes.
Peter Döhle's particular requirements included the
ability to fit cranes in the future, and for this purpose,
space has been allocated in the deck arrangement for
crane posts and jib rests. Strengthening to suit
foundations has been included, and provision made on
the switchboard for additional electrical loadings.
The electrical specification of CMA CGM Sambhar
has already been increased to take account of a greatly
increased intake of refrigerated containers. Whereas
Wan Hai 501 was equipped to load only 400 refrigerated
FEU, carried in three tiers above the hatch covers, the
Döhle vessel can accept 879FEU by also providing
electrical connections in hold numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The consequent increased loading is met by installing
four 2400kW diesel-alternator sets and two 800kW
power packs, instead of the 3 x 2280kW units fitted to
Wan Hai 501.
An extra knot of speed has been gained for CMA
CGM Sambhar by fitting a Sulzer RTflex-96C main
the MAN B&W 8K90MC-C unit adopted for the4250TEU series. This drives a six-bladed FP propeller
giving a service speed at 90% MCR and allowing a sea
margin of 15%, of 25.55knots. A 1600kW bow thruster
is fitted, and the entire machinery installation is
controlled from an integrated control monitoring
system covering ballast, fuel oil, power management,
bilge alarms, and draught gauges. The loading computer
and reefer container monitoring systems are also inter-
connected.
In essence, these CSBC designs conform to the usual
container ship configuration, with six cargo holds
forward of the machinery space/superstructure, and
MacGregor pontoon hatch covers with loadings of80tonnes and 110tonnes TEU/FEU. Normal stowage
is seven tiers and 13 rows on deck, and 11 rows in the
holds where five tiers of conventional boxes plus two
tiers of high-cube units can be carried. The holds are of
girderless construction and can accept dangerous
goods, excluding IMDG class 1, in numbers 2, 3 and 4.

T
HE Newhaven/Dieppe ferry link has endured
many problems in recent times, but now, operated
by local-government-controlled Transmanche Ferries,
an attempt is being made to revive its fortunes using
two new vessels, based on a successful design
examples of this design have been described in the2004 and 2005 editions of Significant Ships. A third sister
has now joined that earlier pair on Canary Islands
services (with more to follow), and, together with these
French vessels, they emphasise the builder's growing
position as a leader in the construction of this type of
ferry.
A full-length superstructure containing two decks
(Nos 6 and 7) surmounts the hull, with No 8 deck
way of port and starboard stern ramps/doors, each16m long x 7m, opening on to the main (No 3) deck,
leading directly, by means of fixed ramps, to No 4 deck.
In a change from the Spanish ferries, a bow door/ramp
with visor is fitted to the Transmanche vessels,
providing additional access to No 3 deck. A hoistable
ramps allow internal movement of vehicles. A total of1150 lane metres of 3m-wide track is available to
accommodate 224 cars and 31 x 16.5m trailers or 62
trailers. Facilities are also included for hazardous
cargoes to be carried on the main deck.
Deck 6 provides 49 x four-person passenger cabins, a
two-berth disabled persons' cabin, and the usual array
of refreshment areas, video lounges, and bars, serving a
total passenger complement of 600. Deck 7 is allocated
to facilities for a crew of 44 and an à la carte passenger
for travellers. Lifesaving equipment consists of two x100-person lifeboats carried under conventional davits,
and four marine escape systems utilising vertical chutes,
with each handling 125 passengers. In addition, there
are two rescue boats, and nine self-righting liferafts.
A major variation from the Spanish-owned ships is in
the engineroom, where higher-powered Wärtsilä 9L46C
main engines replace the Spanish eight-cylinder units.
Each develops 9450kW at 500rev/min, with the shaft
clutchless reduction gears, for a service speed of22knots. A changed alternator specification now
features two 1500kW sets driven from the gearboxes,
plus three 1080kW diesel-driven units. Two 1300kW
bow thrusters enhance manoeuvrability, and passenger
comfort benefits from a pair of fin stabilisers which
reduce roll by 90%. There is also a Hoppe heel control
system for use during loading and discharge.

T
HIS five-ship order from the United Arab
Emirates illustrates Hyundai Mipo's versatility in
the product/chemical tanker field, by presenting a
much smaller version of this popular ship-type than
has previously been featured amongst the yard's
to carry 13,100dwt on a scantling draught of 8.60m,
Eships Cobia is single decked, and has a double hull
surrounding six pairs of cargo tanks and the two slop
tanks positioned at the aft end of the cargo space. Also
protected in this way are the fuel bunkers at the
forward end of the engineroom.
The design follows common practice by having tank
divisions of
corrugated construction,
external
longitudinal and transverse deck stiffening, and side
structure within the double-hull space, thereby
providing a smooth internal surface suitable for
petroleum products and IMO Types 2 and 3 chemical
cargoes, when coated with phenolic epoxy. Piping, and
the 12 Framo 300m3/h submerged cargo pumps (plus 2
x 100m3/h similar units serving the slop tanks), are
constructed of stainless steel.
An open-water sternframe is fitted, supporting a
hinged-flap type rudder. Accommodation for 20 crew
and six Suez Canal personnel is arranged in a block
superstructure above the engineroom, separated from
the funnel casing and the 26-person free-fall lifeboat
The medium-speed Mak 9M32C main engine runs at600rev/min to produce a MCR output of 4500kW, and
a NCR output which is 90% of that value (4050kW).
Service speed at the NCR figure, allowing a sea margin
of 15%, when sailing at design draught, is 13.50knots. A
CP propeller is fitted, driven at 165rev/min through a
Scana Volda reduction gearbox, with a PTO/PTI
connection to a 600kW A van Kaick shaft alternator.
Two diesel-driven alternators, each producing 800kW,
are also installed.

F
INCANTIERI has spread the construction of this
five-ship series of ro-pax ferries between its
Ancona and Castellammare di Stabia shipyards, with
each delivering a vessel of the first pair in service,
Finnstar and Finnmaid respectively, into their owner's
Helsinki/Travemünde link.
Here, a record rolling-
freight capacity, stowage for 250 x 14m trailers carried
in 4200 lane metres, and space for 62 cars, gives rise to
claims that the vessels are the largest and fastest of
their type in the world.
The design is laid out with a superstructure, partially
most of the fore deck and providing accommodation in201 cabins for 573 passengers, for whom shops, bars,
saunas, children's play rooms, gymnasium and games
room, restaurants, and lounges are facilities on offer in
a comfortable environment, enhanced by a pair of
active fin-type stabilisers.
The propelling machinery is located in approximately
the three-quarter-length position, with exhausts carried
up a funnel structure at the port side. A MacGregor
hydraulically operated cargo access package offers twin-
level entry at both ends of the ship: aft this comprises a
single-section, 12.5m (plus 3m flaps) long x 23m wide
length, two-section, 18m wide unit at upper deck (No5). Forward, entry is over a three-section bow
door/ramp on the main deck having an overall length
of 19.4m (plus 2m flaps) and a 2.7m driveway, and via a
bow bulwark door and visor at upper deck level.
Internal movement of vehicles between decks 2/3
and 5/7 is by means of fixed and hoistable ramps with
watertight/weathertight covers,
whilst additional
stowage is provided by an end-hinged, three-panel,
hoistable deck which forms part of the fixed ramp
between Nos 2 and 3 decks when lowered. Also
supplied by MacGregor are two, top-hinged garage
doors on deck 7.
Main 
propulsion 
is 
provided 
four10,395kW/500rev/min, Wärtsilä nine-cylinder L46D
engines, connected in pairs via flexible couplings to two,
twin-input/single-output reduction gearboxes, and then
to a CP propeller running at 150rev/min. The
combined MCR output is approximately 41,580kW and
the recorded trial speed 25knots.
Electrical power is derived from three alternators
driven from Wärtsilä 6L20 engines, each having an
output of 1140kW at 1000rev/min, and arranged to
run on marine diesel oil. Two shaft-driven alternators
type PTO and supplying 2200kW when running at1500rev/min.
Two flap-type rudders are fitted, with manoeuvrability
enhanced by two 2000kW CP bow thrusters. For
mooring purposes, two self-tensioning, electrically
driven, combined anchor windlass/winches are fitted
on the forecastle, and four self-tensioning winches aft.

AMBURG-based Rickmers Reederei is another of
the many German shipowners who have found
excellent employment for their fleets in the container-
ship charter market, with Hyundai Mipo, likewise, one
of the shipbuilders who have met the resulting demand
for tonnage by developing a collection of standard
An example of this output is Ital Festosa, rated as a3500TEU container ship (actual loading 3451TEU),
which is a size which fits into the trading patterns of
many of
the principal lines requiring chartered
tonnage.
This vessel is configured in the popular five-holds-
forward of the superstructure, one-aft, layout adopted
by many builders of ships of this class. Each hold is
closed by steel pontoon covers designed to load two
TEU stacks. In addition space is provided aft, between
the superstructure and No 6 hold, for an FEU stack
stowed directly on deck, with similar FEU stowage
arranged right-aft over the mooring deck.
A maximum 11 rows of boxes can be stacked in the
holds to a height of 6 x 8ft 6in units, topped off with a
single tier of 9ft 6in boxes. On deck and hatch covers,
the maximum loadings are 7 x 8ft 6in tiers high and 13
rows. For stability calculation purposes, it is considered
that 2370TEU, loaded to 14tonnes each, can be carried.
Refrigerated containers in the holds are cooled by
mechanical ventilation, and 550 electrical connections
are also provided. Cell guides are fitted throughout, and
there is provision for 45ft containers to be loaded.
Ital Festosa is fitted with a MAN B&W 7K90MC-C
main engine,
manufactured by Hyundai Heavy
Industries and developing 31,990kW at 104rev/min.
Service speed at the design draught of 10.8m, with the
engine producing 90% MCR and allowing 15% sea
margin is approximately 23.50knots. Electrical supply
comes from four diesel-alternator sets with both prime
companies. Two of these machines have outputs of1700kW each, and two produce 1950kW. A bow
thruster of 1200kW is installed.

T
HE rapid growth of Turkish shipbuilding over
recent years has been accompanied by a move into
the design and construction of quite sophisticated
tonnage, with this bulk cement carrier, built for a Greek
owner specialising in this trade, being an interesting
example. Naftocement XI is the first vessel of the type to
be built by Selah, and her design incorporates a tailor-
made, automated, screw compressor-based loading and
discharging system, which can receive cargo from shore
either mechanically or pneumatically, and discharge it
pneumatically.
Generally, the hull is that of a bulk carrier with a
single skin, in which four cargo holds are arranged , two
forward and two aft of the midships loading position.
Portland cement: specific surface Elaine 3250-4000cm3/g,
specific gravity 1.20tonne/m3,
and
maximum temperature 80
oC.
Loading and unloading is carried out through shore
connections positioned at midships P&S. Maximum
pneumatic loading rate is 600tonnes/h, with discharge
accomplished at 500tonnes/h. Mechanical loading rate
is 750tonnes/h with cargo conveyed from shore by a
flexible bellows into a receiving airslide system on deck.
This discharges cement into the loading box of a
transfer screw conveyor equipped with a 63kW motor,
for shifting to a receiving hopper, thence to horizontal
reversible screw conveyors driven by 88kW motors.
The latter carry cargo to either the forward or aft holds,
as required. Pneumatic loading brings the cement on
board by pipeline from shore and discharges it into the
receiving hopper, then on to the reversible screw
conveyor, from where the process continues as above.
For discharge purposes, air is blown through the
fabric of sloped aeration panels installed on the tanktop
of each hold. This fluidises the cargo, allowing it to
flow to the centreline where a vertical screw conveyor
raises it to the horizontal conveyor above deck, and
thence to shore. All surplus air circulating during these
operations is removed by means of deck-mounted dust
collectors, and the entire system is computerised for
operation by one man. During loading, a 1000m3/h
high-pressure fan, driven by a 4.6kW motor, supplies air
to the hopper airslides.
Naftocement XI is fitted with a Wärtsilä 8L38 main
engine developing 5800kW (B-output) at 600rev/min,
and coupled via a reduction gearbox from the same
supplier, to a CP propeller running at 125.5rev/min. A
Marelli alternator, driven from the main engine gearbox,
produces 1625kW at 1800rev/min at sea, and there are
two Wärtsilä/Fenixi 950kVA diesel-driven sets available
to supply the loadings of the cargo equipment,
domestic outlets, and a Brunvoll 450kW bow thruster.
One oil-fired, and one exhaust-gas boiler satisfy steam
requirements.

F
LENSBURGER'S position as an undisputed market
leader in the field of ro-ro ships is emphasised by the
delivery of yet another variant to a design first introduced
in 2000 for Turkish owners, and featured in Significant
Ships of that year (see UND Akdeniz). Modified versions
of the design have already been described in our 2002
and 2003 issues, and further changes have now been
made to suit Cobelfret's requirements for that company's
Belgium/UK container/ro-ro services.
The most
obvious of these has involved moving the superstructure
to a forward position, but more significant internally is
the provision of five fixed vehicle decks - possibly the
first time ever.
After switching to an MAN B&W single engine
configuration for Tor Magnolia in 2003, Flensburger has
now reverted to the twin engine lay-out of the basis
design, but replacing the MaK 9M43 engines used in
UND Akdeniz, and the seven-cylinder installation of
Hurst Point, with larger MaK 12M43 vee-form power
units. These each develop 10,800kW and drive individual
CP propellers through Flender gearboxes for a service
speed of 21.70knots.
The propulsive efficiency of this installation also
benefits from an aft body hull form which features a
central skeg, claimed to offer reduced wave patterns, an
even wake field, and excellent water flow to the propellers.
Further propulsion enhancement, as well as higher lift,
comes from the twin asymmetric rudders operated by
ram-type steering gears.
Specially developed by
Flensburger, the rudders incorporate a Costa bulb, and
feature a twisted leading edge, which gains maximum
benefit from the rotational energy produced behind the
propeller. Power take-offs from the two gearboxes each
electrical supply available from two 1300kVA and one900kVA diesel sets. Two bow thrusters, each of 27tonnes,
thrust assist manoeuvring.
Six vehicle decks in total are provided (the sixth is a
tweendeck for cars, situated below the open top deck),
with access from the shore made to the main deck over
two independently operated stern ramps capable of
accepting loads up to 186tonnes. The port ramp serves
the upper deck and has a free width of 7.5m, whilst the
starboard ramp is 14.5m wide and serves the main deck
directly.
Clear height above the main deck is 7.35m, with 7.0m
available above the tanktop; the latter is accessed by
means of a 4.4m wide fixed ramp at the starboard side of
the main deck. Both these decks can accept double-stack
Mafi trailers and, together with the upper deck, can handle
vehicle weights up to 93.50tonnes. The upper deck and
trailer deck above are linked by a 4.4m wide fixed ramp
which is positioned in line with the portside stern access.
The trailer deck is suitable for deck loads in SECU
(Stora Enso Container Units) boxes up to 93.50tonnes or
Mafis up to 74tonnes, and offers a clear height of 5.05m.
A fixed ramp from the aft end of the trailer deck leads to
a tweendeck arranged to load 181 cars, and from the
forward end of this deck a hoistable ramp links to the
open top deck, designated for cars or vans.
Refrigerated cargo can be carried on all decks, with
electrical connections provided for 36 containers. The
superstructure is built into a whaleback screen at the
forward end of the trailer deck, which affords protection
to the bow mooring position, and is topped by a
wheelhouse. This incorporates fully enclosed bridge
wings giving all-round vision, and contains the ship
control centre, which is equipped with an integrated
bridge system, navigation centre, combined visualisation
of radar and electronic sea chart, and an automatic
identification system.

HINA is one of the few countries in the world still
operating train ferries within its railway system, and
it is currently extending the network still further by
establishing a new link between the north east of the
country and the Yangtze River Delta, by way of the
Bohai Strait. The new route condenses a long, circular
journey around Bo Hai into an approximately 100-mile
crossing of the strait between Yantai in Shandong
Province, and Dalian, directly opposite, in Liaoning
Province.
Sinorail Bohai 1 is the first of four new ferries custom-
designed for the service, which will perform a
multipurpose function, with the main deck providing
five flush rail tracks with a total lane length of 735m;
this space will be capable of accommodating 50 x 14m
cargo wagons carrying 4000tonnes of freight, including
dangerous goods of IMO classes 2-9, loaded over a
shore linkspan, through a top-hinged stern door. The
upper deck is arranged for road vehicles and is accessed
by way of a door/ramp in the starboard, aft quarter of
the superstructure. With no bow entry, space is
provided at the fore end of the deck as a turning circle.
Total vehicle lane length is 486m, equivalent to 50 x 7m
trucks and 25 cars.
Despite the relatively short duration of the voyage,
the 480 passengers carried are well catered for, with 98
cabins available on A and B decks and 1000m2 of public
spaces, including supermarket, sightseeing lounge,
cinema, multi-function bar, and restaurants provided. In
addition, a four-deck high entrance hall forms a central
feature. A complement of 63 is carried to operate the
vessel, and lifesaving equipment includes two 82-person
motor lifeboats housed in recesses port and starboard
on the upper deck, and two Viking 227-person vertical
marine evacuation systems.
Trim and stability problems during cargo handling are
controlled using an Intering air-activated anti-heel
system capable of compensating for a heeling moment
of 10,000tonne-metres in two minutes, balancing the
loading/unloading of an 800tonne train, and limiting
heeling angle to 2deg. Ballast tanks totalling 1900m3 can
be used to change draught level at the stern, allow a trim
adjustment of 1m within 30 minutes, and reduce rise
and fall of the railway linkspan. Passenger comfort and
cargo safety, in conditions up to Beaufort 8, are
improved by a pair of Rolls-Royce folding fin stabilisers.
MaK/ABB diesel-alternator sets, each developing2880kW to satisfy the ship's electrical requirements, and
also to supply the 4088kW drive motors of the two
ABB Compact Azipod propulsion units, suspended
under the stern each side of a central skeg. Two 710kW
bow thrusters are fitted and, with the Azipods, provide
a manoeuvring system which allows the ferry to turn in
its own length, and to move sideways.

T
HE delivery of STX Ace 1 marks the completion of
another step in the rescue programme initiated by
engineering company Ssangyong, which a few years
ago saw the transformation of financially troubled
Daedong into the STX Shipbuilding Co. That rescue
forged a link between shipbuilding and marine
enginebuilding, through the new parent company, and
now the connection is made with shipowning, with
STX Ace 1 the first newbuilding delivery from the
shipyard to its shipping subsidiary.
The design is configured as a single-deck tanker with
forecastle and a superstructure aft, built over the
machinery space, which houses the accommodation,
and is topped by a wheelhouse equipped with a full
array of navigational aids which, unusually, perhaps, in
today's ships, does not include a facility for one-man
operation. The hull is a double-skin structure, with the
side and bottom tanks so formed given over to water
ballast purposes, and enclosing a cargo space which is
divided into six pairs of tanks by a centreline, and
transverse bulkheads.
The bulkheads are of corrugated construction, built
on stools, and, with the ship's side and deck stiffening
outside of the cargo tanks, they present a flush internal
surface. This is coated with 300microns of phenolic
epoxy to provide protection against more than 320
commodities likely to be loaded, including sodium
hydroxide solution, IMO Type II and III chemicals, and
crude oil.
The STX Group also has an involvement with the
cargo handling systems through STX-Enpaco which, in
association with Kosako, from Japan, supplied 12
hydraulic, submerged pumps of 600m3/h duty, together
with 2 x 300m3/h and 1 x 100m3/h similar pumps
installed in the slop tanks and a residues tank,
respectively. Water ballast capacity is 24,425m3, handled
by 2 x 750m3/h hydraulic pumps also supplied by STX-
Enpaco. Each ballast tank has an overflow line for
ballast exchange, operated on the flow-through method
by an automatic remote valve control system.
The machinery division of the STX Group supplied
the main engine: a MAN B&W 6S50MC-C unit
developing 8169kW at 121rev/min; at 90% MCR
(7352kW) and allowing a 10% sea margin, service speed
is 14.70knots. Electrical supply is drawn from three
Hyundai 740kW alternator sets driven by STX-built
MAN 6L23/30H diesel engines, with steam produced
in a 18,000kg/h oil-fired boiler and a 1200kg/h
composite unit. Yet another STX affiliation sees a union
with Danish specialist Lyngsø to supply the bridge
control system.

HINA Shipbuilding's portfolio of container ship
designs has already been opened in this issue of
CMA CGM Sambhar, and is now examined again in
order to feature YM Intelligent, the first of 12 feeder-
type vessels building for Taiwanese owner Yang Ming
Marine Transport. The design is already a proven one,
with four vessels in service and 15 more on order or
under construction, and with an eye to the expected
growth in the feeder ship market, Yang Ming considers
that its characteristics will meet future needs. A few
extras have been added to the basic specification,
however, such as additional electrical connections to
cater for a total of 200 refrigerated FEU, and the
provision of space on deck for more 45ft containers.
YM Intelligent is laid out with machinery space and
eight-tier superstructure three-quarters aft, and four
cargo holds forward of this position. No 1 hold is
restricted by the forebody lines, and with part of its
space unusable for containers, additional fore peak
ballast capacity and a bow thruster room have been
provided.
Although there are no cargo holds aft of the
superstructure, space is allocated there for two FEU
stacks to be loaded on deck in this position. The hull is
double-skinned in way of the cargo holds forming side
tanks separate from the double bottom. These are
allocated for water ballast (including heeling tanks), fuel,
and sludge collection. The double bottom is divided at
the centreline and is used for water ballast.
MacGregor pontoon hatch covers, constructed by
CSBC, close the hatches and are designed for loadings
of 60tonnes and 90tonnes, respectively, for TEU/FEU.
Maximum container stowages are six tiers and 11 rows
Dangerous goods can be carried on deck, and 132 x45ft units can be loaded on deck in the third tier and
above. Refrigerated containers are catered for in the
bottom three tiers of deck stacks, with additional
sockets available in the upper deck longitudinal passage.
B&W 7S60MC-C main engine which runs at105rev/min to develop an MCR of 15,820kW. At 90%
of this power, and allowing a 15% sea margin, the
service speed is 20.20knots. The five-bladed, FP
propeller is 6500mm diameter and is fitted into a hull
form optimised by repetitive numerical flow
computations and model tests carried out at the
shipyard, and at the Hamburg tank.
Electrical requirements are served by three
Daihatsu/Nishishiba 1200kW diesel-alternator sets.
The automatic remote control system conforms with an
American Bureau of Shipping ACCU notation, and the
main engine can be operated both from the wheelhouse
and the bridge wings. An 800kW Kawasaki bow
thruster is fitted, and a rudder skeg is incorporated in
the aft body.
