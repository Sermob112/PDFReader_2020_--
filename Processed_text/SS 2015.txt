T
he 74,000dwt NAVIG8 EXCEL was built at the 
Jin-hae Shipyard. This vessel has an overall 
length of 219m, a moulded breadth of 38m and a 
moulded depth of 19.30m. The service speed at 
design draught is 14knots at NCR power for the 
main engine with a 15% sea margin, and maximum 
deadweight is about 74,720.7tonnes on a scantling 
draught of 13.3m. 
The cargo area has three longitudinal bulkheads 
with double bottom and double hull, and consists 
of six pairs of cargo oil tanks, one pair of slop 
tanks, and six pairs of segregated water ballast 
tanks. The aft body with transom stern includes 
the steering gear compartment, fresh water tanks 
and aft peak tank.
All marine environmental, safety and quality 
assurance criteria for seagoing vessels in accordance 
with ExxonMobil are met.
The propelling machinery consists of a two stroke, 
STX MAN 6S60ME-C8.2 engine. The electricity 
generating plant consists of three sets of main diesel 
generator engines and one set of emergency diesel 
generator engines.
