T
HE Damen Double Hull Oil Tanker 8000 King Fisher 
was delivered in June to Dutch managers De Opfeart 
Beheer. In a two-tanker deal, King Fisher’s sister vessel Kestrel 
Fisher was delivered at the end of 2013. Both of the vessels 
were built by Damen Shipyards Bergum. 
James Fisher Everard will operate the two new tankers on 
an open management basis and will carry gasoline, diesel oil, 
lubrication oil and jet fuels along the British Isles, the 
Continent and in Scandinavian and Baltic waters. 
according to the patented ‘Damen Double Hull Oil Tanker8000’ design. The 8000 represents the 8,363m
carrying capacity of the vessels. One important feature of the 
vessels’ design is its heat recovery ability. For this the vessels 
feature a power take-in, whereby the diesel generator sets will 
immediately power the shaft generator, which is mounted on 
the gearbox, should the main engine fail. Furthermore, the 
generated heat is also captured by heat exchangers to be 
redeployed for heavy fuel oil pre-heating or other use.
The 8000 is based on the design of previous Damen-built 
vessels and the ongoing improvement of vessels under 
construction and in design. Special attention has been paid 
to the underwater shape, resulting in low resistance and good 
sea-keeping hull forms, combined with good carrying 
capabilities. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis 
and model testing techniques have been used for verification 
and optimisation. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been 
used for the structural analysis.
Crew comfort has also been taken into consideration with 
the design and outfitting of these vessels. To achieve a better 
working environment onboard Damen has incorporated in 
to the design lower interior noise levels, enhanced interior 
King Fisher and Kestrel Fisher have a length overall of104.52m, a 17m beam (moulded) and 10 epoxy coated
pumps that have a capacity of 200m3/h. The fuel tanks are
positioned in the back of the vessel. All the fuel oil tanks are 
loose from the shell and the HFO bunkers are located 
midship between the holds.
The accommodation caters for a complement of 10 plus 
one guest. The vessel is powered by a MaK 8 M 25C that has 
a power output of 2,640kW giving the vessel a service speed 
is about 12.5knots.
