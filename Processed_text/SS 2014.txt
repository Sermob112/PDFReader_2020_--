E
MERALD Sky is the first in the series of river 
cruise vessels for Emerald Waterways, a 
European river cruise line that made its debut as 
part of Australian-owned parent company Scenic 
Tours. The vessel was constructed at Shipyard De 
Hoop, in The Netherlands, and delivered to 
Emerald Waterways in March. Emerald Sky is the 
first in a series of two vessels that were both 
delivered in 2014. 
The Emerald Waterways brand has taken a step 
away from the traditional river cruising look with 
its latest vessel, by creating a more modern look 
aboard the vessels. Emerald Waterways are a new 
river cruise line, designed to sail the European 
waterways. The cruise line officially began 
operations in April 2014 with the launch of Emerald 
Sky, followed by Emerald Star three weeks later. 
Until recently, to fulfil their European tour 
requirements, the owner has chartered additional 
vessels (from Lueftner Reisen a.o.) under a different 
company name. The fleet expansions are intended 
to operate alongside Scenic Tours’ existing river 
cruise products.
While chartering vessels from other river cruise 
providers, the cruise operator discovered Amadeus 
Silver, built by Shipyard De Hoop, which they operated 
for a complete season to their full satisfaction. This 
positive experience led the owners to ask De Hoop to 
design and build the first two luxury 135m River 
Cruise Vessels (yn 462 & 464) for their newly 
established company.  At the same time, the owners 
ordered a special 110m design (yn 463) for their 
Scenic Tours programme in France on the River Seine.
One of the key new features about Emerald Sky is 
the multi-functional area at the rear of the ship 
which is a luxury pool and health plaza during the 
day, by night this area will convert to a cinema, with 
seating for over 30 people, or a dance floor. 
Furthermore, the area can be used as a small separate 
lunch area.
Both ships measure 135m in length, feature 91 
cabins and have the capacity to host a total of 182 
passengers. The vessels are outfitted with large 
luxury suites most of which include a balcony. The 
vessel is powered by a Caterpillar C32 that has a 
power output of 746kW and gives the vessel a service 
speed of 12knots.

S
AN Sha 1 Hao is the first Ro-Pax cruiser purposely 
designed and built in China for the Chinese 
market. The vessel was constructed at Bohai 
Shipbuilding Heavy Industry and delivered to its 
owner Sansha City in Hainan Province in September. 
With the design of the vessel carried out by Danish 
designer Knud E. Hansen. 
The ship is intended for the transportation of 
passengers and cargo for unrestricted service and will 
be engaged primarily in the comprehensive supply for 
the Xisha, Nansha and Zhongsha islands belonging to 
the city of Sansha. 
The conventionally powered ro-ro passenger 
vessel is designed to transport vehicle and 
containers on a single cargo deck in compliance 
with Chinese Classification Society Rules and 
Chinese Flag regulations.
San Sha 1Hao is able to carry containers, up to 20 
standard trailers as well as 456 passengers and 
measures 122.3m long and 21m wide, the ship has a 
displacement of 7,800tonnes with endurance of 6,000 
nautical miles. The ship is also equipped with a 
helicopter landing platform, which makes it 
convenient for maritime rescue and island patrolling.
Three medium speed, four-stroke, turbocharged, 
charge-air cooled marine diesel engines, each directly 
coupled to an AC generator fitted on common 
bedplate are to be provided.
The engines are designed for running on HFO and 
meet with DIN ISO 3046-1 for Emission Standard 
Tier II  regulations for emissions (NOx optimised). 
The two main engines are flexibly coupled to two 
reduction ratio from the main engine RPM to approx.130 RPM on the propeller shaft. Each gear
incorporates a thrust bearing. 
One remote controlled integrated hydraulic clutch is 
fitted between each gearbox and engine for engaging 
and disengaging of the main engines.
The vessel has been developed with optimised work 
flow in mind, which will allow maximum operational 
efficiency including boat to boat embarkation 
procedures which will be required in specific islands 
without dedicated berthing facilities.
As compared with Qiongsha No. 3, the existing 
transport vessel for Sansha City, San Sha 1 Hao can 
sail normally against Beaufort 8 winds and remain 
secure in the gale. The vessel is expected to shorten 
the cruise time from Qinglan Port in Wenchang City, 
Hainan Province to Yongxing Island of Sansha City 
from 15 hours to 10 hours.
