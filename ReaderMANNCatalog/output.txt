Engine type designation 
To ensure that the engine designation describes the engine with regard to 
the fuel injection concept and the Tier III technology applied, the engine 
type designation also includes these concepts as described below (full 
designation, see page 19):
Fuel injection concept (GI, GIE, LGIP, LGIM)
No designation = MDO/HFO
Tier III technology (EGRBP, EGRTC, EcoEGR, HPSCR, LPSCR)
No designation = Tier II 
5G70ME-C10.5-GI-EGRBP
Fuel injection concepts are explained in detail on page 10 (ME-GI and 
ME-LGI dual fuel engines) and Tier III technologies on  
page 11. 
ME-C engines 
The electronic control of the ME-C engines includes flexible control of the 
cylinder processes, i.e. fuel injection timing and actuation of exhaust 
valves, starting valves, and cylinder lubrication.
7
ME-B engines 
ME-B engines use electronically controlled pressure boosters for the fuel 
injection whereas actuation of the exhaust valves is camshaft operated, but 
with electronically controlled variable closing timing. 
CEAS, TCS and Engine selection guide
CEAS (computerized engine application system), TCS (turbocharger 
selection) and Engine selection guide applications cover all engine variants 
including available dual fuel and Tier III technology options. These 
applications provide essential data for the design and dimensioning of a 
ship’s engine room (CEAS), applicable turbochargers (TCS) and Engine 
selection guide.
CEAS/TCS/Engine selection guide are available online at: 
www.man-es.com → marine → planning-tools-and-downloads → 
ceas-engine-calculations/turbocharger-selection/engine-selection-guide
In CEAS and TCS, all engines in this programme can be selected from the 
category ‘Catalogue: Official’. 
Earlier versions of this engine programme mention additional engine types. 
Some of these are still available in CEAS and TCS under the category 
‘Catalogue: Replaced’. New development will only be implemented in these 
designs to the extent it is considered necessary based on service 
experience. New efficiency enhancing features will not be available on older 
engine types.
The Engine selection guide is our recently launched web tool designed to 
offer an easy overview of our two-stroke MAN B&W engine portfolio. With a 
few inputs, it provides a selection of relevant engines and variants and 
offers the option to sort the engine selection according to fuel 
consumption.
Engine power 
The engine brake power is stated in kW. The power values stated in the 
tables are available up to tropical conditions at sea level, i.e.: 
–	 turbocharger inlet air temperature 45°C 
–	 turbocharger inlet air pressure 1,000 mbar 
–	 cooling water (sea/fresh) temperature 32/36°C

Specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) 
The figures in the two-stroke chapter represent the values obtained when 
the engine and turbocharger are matched to the lowest possible SFOC 
values while fulfilling the IMO NOX Tier II or Tier III emission limits. 
The SFOC figures are given in g/kWh and are based on the use of a fuel oil 
with a lower calorific value (LCV) equal to 42,700 kJ/kg at ISO conditions: 
–	 turbocharger inlet air temperature 25°C 
–	 turbocharger inlet air pressure 1,000 mbar 
–	 cooling water temperature 25°C
Tolerances 
The energy efficiency design index (EEDI) has led to increased focus on 
part-load SFOC. Therefore, MAN Energy Solutions offers the option to 
select the SFOC guarantee at a load point in the range from 50% to 100%. 
It is recommended that the SFOC guarantee point should be limited to the 
range 50% to 85% for part-load or low-load tuning methods. 
When choosing an SFOC guarantee at or below 100%, the tolerances, 
adjustment, and calibration at 100% will affect an engine running at the 
lower SFOC guarantee load point. This includes tolerances on measuring 
equipment, engine process control, and turbocharger performance. 
For actual SFOC tolerances, reference is given to CEAS. 
Please note that the SFOC guarantee can only be given in one load point for 
Tier II engines. For Tier III engines see page 11.
Turbocharging system 
Two-stroke engines can be delivered with MAN, Accelleron, or MHI 
turbochargers as standard.
The SFOC figures given in the two-stroke chapter are based on 
turbocharging with the best possible turbocharging efficiency generally 
available, which means 67% for all engines with 45-cm bore and larger, and 
64% for engine bores smaller than 45 cm. Both efficiency figures refer to 
100% SMCR. 
9
There are exceptions to this rule, S40ME-C9.5 and S35ME-C9.7 are also 
available as standard high-efficiency applications offering all Tier II standard 
tunings and all Tier III options requiring a high-efficiency turbocharger.
Only engine specifications for which an applicable high-efficiency 
turbocharger is available are subject to firm order.
Fuel consumption and optimisation possibilities for Tier II engines 
Various optimisation possibilities for improved part-load and low-load 
SFOC are available for MAN B&W type engines. High-load optimisation is 
for best possible SFOC at 100% engine load. 
Optimisation of SFOC in the part-load range (50-85%) or low-load range 
(25-70%) requires selection of the EGB (exhaust gas bypass) tuning method 
available for most ME-C and ME-B engines. For G80ME-C10.6, 
G70ME-C10.7, S60ME-C10.6, G50ME-C10.7 and S50ME-C10.6, the EGB 
tuning method is available in the low-load version.
EPT (engine process tuning) is available for G95ME-C10.5, G80ME-C10.5 
and G60ME-C10.5. EPT uses engine control process parameters to 
improve part or low-load SFOC. 
SEQ (sequential tuning) is standard for G95ME-C10.6. This includes 
sequential fuel injection and turbocharging application similar to the 
EGRTC Tier III technology. This will be available in the low-load version. 
The tuning methods mentioned are available for all SMCR points, but 
cannot be combined.
In cases where a higher steam production is needed, the EEC (economiser 
energy control) solution offers additional automatic control of an EGB. 
Forcing an EGB open at loads where the EGB is normally closed results in a 
higher exhaust gas temperature, but with an SFOC penalty. However, the 
total fuel consumption (engine and oil-fired boiler) will be improved. 
By adding an EGB, a higher steam production can also be obtained for EPT 
and SEQ-tuned engines. The EGB must be closed above 90% engine load, 
but can be opened below 90% to obtain higher exhaust temperatures 
resulting in increased steam production. 
Calculations with EEC are made on request.

In this engine programme, engines available for the different fuel types are 
listed in separate sections: GI (page 39), LGIM (page 51), LGIP (page 
63), and GIE (page 67). 
Pilot oil energy fraction
In dual fuel mode, the pilot oil energy fraction amounts to 1.5%-5.0% for GI, 
depending on engine type, 5.0% for GIE, LGIP and for LGIM in L1 rating. For 
actual pilot oil energy fractions, refer to individual engine pages and CEAS.

G95/90/80/70ME-C10.5-GI engines have a gas tuning, called “dual fuel gas 
optimised”, with improved gas consumption in dual fuel mode. All other 
ME-GI engines have a “dual fuel standard” gas tuning. Both gas tunings 
apply to both Tier II and all Tier III technologies. 
The following fuel consumption figures are shown in the tables for dual fuel 
engines: 
–	  dual fuel mode with distribution of specific gas consumption (SGC) and 
specific pilot oil consumption (SPOC) 
–	 fuel oil mode 
11
Guarantee figures for dual fuel engines are given for heat rate, which has 
the same tolerances as SFOC guarantees, see page 8. 
Heat rate is defined as follows (example for methane as dual fuel): Heat rate 
(kJ/kWh) = SGC (g/kWh) × 50 kJ/g + SPOC (g/kWh) × 42.7 kJ/g. 
The CEAS report will specify the distribution between SGC and SPOC as 
well as the heat rate over the load range. 
In the past, cylinder lubrication oils have been mixed to optimise the 
cleaning performance of an oil to the level required by a specific engine, or 
specific operating conditions. For example, by mixing a Cat. II BN 100 oil 
with a less efficient BN 40–70 oil. With the introduction of Cat. II BN 40 oils, 
alternating between high- and low-BN cylinder oils is no longer necessary.
Greenhouse gas emissions 
In existing IMO regulations, the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) and 
other measures operate with CO2 as the only contributor to greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. However, IMO is considering to regulate other 
GHGs than CO2 (methane and laughing gas). The expected timeframe for 
adoption of the IMO regulation on methane slip is 3-5 years. Further, 
upcoming EU regulations (FuelEU Maritime and EU Emission trading 
system (ETS)) are expected to cover methane slip and laughing gas from 
2025 and 2026, respectively
In its effort to facilitate decarbonisation in the shipping industry, MAN 
Energy Solutions will, for the complete two-stroke engine programme, be 
able to guarantee a methane slip of 0.2 g/kWh with a tolerance of +/-0.2 g/
kWh for ME-GI engines. Additionally, MAN Energy Solutions provides 
methane slip figures for part-load engine operation, please refer to CEAS.
Tier III technologies 
To ensure compliance with IMO Tier III regulations, a Tier III NOX reduction 
technology must be selected. The preferred technology depends on market 
demands, engine type, other requirements, and operational pattern. 
The Emission Project Guide provides more detailed descriptions of these 
technologies at:
www.man-es.com → marine → planning-tools-and-downloads → 
project-guides → two-stroke
MAN Energy Solutions
MAN B&W two-stroke propulsion engines
12
All Tier III engines have at least two operating modes: 
–	 Tier III mode fulfilling the IMO Tier III regulations 
–	 Tier II mode fulfilling the IMO Tier II regulations 
Tier III technologies are designed for either low-sulphur fuels (<0.1%) or 
high-sulphur fuels (>0.5% and <3.5%) in Tier III operation. In Tier II 
operation, the engine is in all cases capable of using fuels with a high 
sulphur content. The fuel sulphur content must be selected when the 
engine is ordered, as it impacts the engine design. Fuel consumption 
guarantees can be given for engines for both Tier II and Tier III modes.
EGR 
Two EGR-matching concepts are available depending on engine bore:
–	 EGRTC: T/C cut-out matching for ME-C engines with bores ≥ 80 cm
–	 EGRBP: Bypass matching for ME-C engines with bores ≤ 70 cm
EGR operation is also possible for GI and LGIM engines.
EcoEGR 
EcoEGR is an SFOC-optimised version of the EGRBP system available on 
most ME-C engines. Compared to the standard EGRBP system, EcoEGR 
engines operate with 10–15% recirculation in Tier II mode and with slightly 
increased recirculation in Tier III mode. EcoEGR engines are available for 
compliant fuels (<0.5 %S) where considerable overall savings are obtained.  
EcoEGR operation is also possible for GI and some LGIM engines, except 
engines with gas-optimised tuning. 
SCR 
Two SCR concepts are available:
–  HPSCR: High-pressure SCR with a reactor installed upstream the 
turbocharger(s)
–  LPSCR: Low-pressure SCR with a reactor installed downstream the 
turbocharger(s)
SCR operation applies to most ME-C and ME-B engines, including some 
dual fuel engine types. The SCR system must be supplied by an approved 
supplier.
13
Application of high-sulphur fuels and SOX scrubbers 
All two-stroke engines in the MAN Energy Solutions marine engine 
programme are compatible with SOX scrubbers, with the exception of 
ME-GIE engines. 
A SOX scrubber installation will increase the backpressure, thereby 
affecting engine performance. Accordingly, it is required that a SOX 
scrubber installation does not increase the backpressure by more than 30 
mbar at SMCR. 
Fuels 
Since 1 January 2020, the global sulphur content for marine fuels must not 
exceed 0.5%. To ensure compliant operation, one of the following methods 
must be selected:
–  Use a compliant fuel:  
	 	
–  Global: max. 0.5% sulphur  
	 	
–  ECA: max. 0.1% sulphur 
–  Use methane, ethane, methanol, or LPG together with a compliant pilot 
fuel.
–  Use a high-sulphur fuel in combination with a SOX scrubber to obtain an 
exhaust gas SOX level equivalent to operation on a compliant fuel. 
Some dual fuel engines are available on request with high-sulphur fuels in 
Tier II fuel oil mode with a scrubber installed.
The fuel specification must be selected at engine order as it impacts the 
engine design. 
Fuels with a viscosity below 700 cSt at 50°C can be used.
Waste heat recovery systems 
Waste heat recovery systems (WHRS) are available for certain engine 
configurations on request for both Tier II and Tier III engines with 
high-efficiency turbochargers. Contact MAN Energy Solutions for further 
information.

14
Power take off systems
Power take off (PTO) systems are available on request for both Tier II and 
Tier III engines with high-efficiency turbochargers. PTO systems operate in 
the margin between the light propeller curve and the load limits of the 
engine. The magnitude of PTO power permitted is as such influenced by 
the propeller light running margin applied for the specific project. The 
specific load of the engine permitted for design, including power for 
propulsion and PTO power, as a function of speed, is governed by the PTO 
layout limit. 
For further information on the PTO layout limit as well as the availability and 
integration of PTOs, please contact MAN Energy Solutions. Information 
about the different PTO solutions can be found in the paper “Shaft 
generators for low speed main engines” – available at: www.man-es.com → 
marine → planning-tools-and-downloads → technical-papers
Lubricating oil consumption 
The system oil consumption varies according to engine sizes and, 
operational and maintenance patterns.
Specific cylinder oil consumption
Alpha ACC (Adaptive Cylinder oil Control) is the lubricating mode for MAN 
B&W two-stroke engines that involves lube oil dosing proportional to the 
engine load and to the sulphur content in the fuel being burned. 
Dosage: 
–	 0-0.5% sulphur fuels including methane (LNG), methanol, LPG and 
ethane (LEG): 
	 Minimum feed rate: 0.6 g/kWh 
–	 >0.5% sulphur fuels (HSFO) (scrubber applications):
	 Feed rate (g/kWh) = ACC × S%, 
	 	
–	 where typically ACC = 0.3 g/(kWh × S%) 
15
Recommended cylinder oils:
–	 Cat. II BN 40 cylinder oil is recommended for engines using low-sulphur 
fuels: 
	 0-0.5% sulphur fuels including methane, methanol, LPG and ethane
–	 Cat. II BN 100-140+ cylinder oil is recommended for engines using 
high-sulphur fuels:
	 >0.5% sulphur fuels
For specific lubrication guidelines, reference is made to the latest 
lubrication guidelines available for your specific engine type, for example 
service letters. Service letters are available at: www.man-es.com → marine 
→ planning-tools-and-downloads → Service Letters
Extent of delivery 
The final and binding extent of delivery of MAN B&W two-stroke engines is 
to be supplied by our licensee, the engine maker, who should be contacted 
to determine the execution for the actual project. 
Special certification processes will need to be specified before an order is 
placed as they require a different scope of delivery, for example: engines 
certified for US EPA, engines with SCR certified by Scheme B, etc.
MAN Asset+ 
MAN Asset+ engine functionality options enable installation and 
management of optional updates and features for MAN B&W engines. It is a 
flexible solution that can match the individual needs of the end users. The 
first MAN Asset+ options available are described in the following.  
Their application depends on the engine and ship type, and they can be 
ordered directly from our licensees.
PMI ACCo 
Adaptive Cylinder Control (ACCo) is a fully automatic system that ensures 
constant optimal engine tuning regardless of engine load, load changes, 
and varying fuel calorific values. Using performance values from the 
MAN Energy Solutions
MAN B&W two-stroke propulsion engines
16
engine’s official shop test as reference, the algorithm adjusts the fuel index 
and exhaust valve operation of each cylinder. PMI ACCo ensures the lowest 
possible fuel consumption.
ACCo is available on request for ME-C engines and is delivered as the 
standard configuration for ME-C10.7 and dual fuel engines.
Synchrophasing 
Synchrophasing is an effective, maintenance-free tool introduced for ship 
types with twin propulsion to reduce vibrations on both vessel and engine 
structures. Vibrations are reduced by synchronising the port and starboard 
shaft speeds, thereby out-balancing forces/moments from the starboard 
engine/propeller with the same forces/moments from the portside engine/ 
propeller. 
Vibrations can be reduced by up to 50-70% depending on sea wave state 
and vessel roll/pitch. Synchrophasing is available on request for all ME-C 
engines.
PTO interface option C
PTO interface option C is an enhanced interface between the engine 
control system (ECS) and the vessel’s power management system (PMS) for 
plants with a large power take off (PTO) or shaft generator capacity relative 
to the SMCR-power. 
The enhanced interface improves governor stability and performance, and 
increases PTO power availability in the design. In addition, PTO interface 
option C provides signals to the PMS that enable automatic load sharing 
between the main engine, the PTO, and the gensets. This ensures a higher 
utilisation rate of the PTO, thus reducing the genset’s running hours. If 
power is supplied solely by the PTO, it will also reduce the risk of blackout 
without overloading of the engine. 
PTO interface option C is available on request for all ME-C engines 
equipped with a large PTO.
PTO option 2 for EEDI
PTO option 2 for EEDI adds additional benefits for engines using PTO 
interface option C. By applying the EEDI guideline’s option 2 for accounting 
for the PTO, the EEDI can be improved, especially, but not exclusively, for 
vessels with a large onboard electric power consumption. At the same time, 
it ensures installation of a main engine with sufficient power and, hereby, 
torque capacity for driving the PTO in conditions less ideal than at sea trial.
17
Adaptive Cooling 
Adaptive Cooling is an improved design of the piping and valve 
arrangement for automatic control of the cooling water flow to the scavenge 
air cooler and the exhaust gas recirculation cooler for EGR engines, 
depending on the engine operating mode.
It reduces the power consumption for cooling water circulation significantly 
when running in Tier II mode (EGRBP and EcoEGR engines) or TC cut-out 
mode (EGRTC engines), see page 12, and, as a result, reduces fuel 
consumption and improves the carbon intensity indicator (CII) rating. 
Adaptive Cooling is available on request for all EGR engines.
Two-stage Cooler 
The Two-stage Cooler is a new scavenge air cooler design that uniquely 
enables utilisation of the energy from the scavenge air cooling process for 
other energy-consuming processes on board, such as increasing the boiler 
feedwater temperature, gas vaporisation, freshwater production, air 
condition heating, organic Rankine cycle system, or the ballast water 
treatment system. This leads to lower fuel consumption and improved CII 
rating. 
The Two-stage Cooler is available on request for all MAN B&W two-stroke 
engines, based on a case-specific pre-study conducted by MAN Energy 
Solutions.

MAN B&W ME-GI  
prepares your fleet for 
future regulations
This dual-fuel engine provides a 
future-proof solution for LNG /
methane-powered vessels thanks to 
its negligible methane slip and high 
operational efficiency. Refined, 
simplified and upgraded, the trusted 
two-stroke engine minimizes 
operation costs by delivering the 
same industry-leading thermal 
efficiency no matter which fuel is 
used.

The hydrodynamic edge
In the complex hydrodynamic entity embracing hull, propeller, and rudder 
- our CFD-based software masters the holistic approach of customised 
blade and rudder bulb designs.
We perform ‘Resistance calculations’ and ‘Calculations of wake field’, 
which form the basis for the following:
	
– Final propeller design
	
– Self-propulsion calculations
	
– Cavitation extent calculations
	
– Propeller-induced pressure impulses and CIS (cavitation inception speed)
Save the ‘stock propeller test’; save time and save money.
With EcoBulb rudder bulb and propeller hub fairing cone installed, uniform 
flow without separation creates improved thrust ahead, and less power is 
required.

MAN four-stroke propulsion engines – all emission requirements
Besides focus on power density and fuel economy, MAN Energy Solutions is 
committed to a steady reduction of the environmental impact of our engines.
IMO Tier II
Applying well-proven methods to achieve a cleaner and more efficient 
combustion process, MAN Energy Solutions has significantly decreased 
NOX emissions. Our four-stroke propulsion engines are IMO Tier II 
compliant with internal engine measures alone. 
IMO Tier III
For operation in emission control areas (ECA), MAN Energy Solutions has 
developed a comprehensive range of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) 
systems that tremendously reduce NOX levels surpassing IMO Tier III  
requirements.
MAN Energy Solutions is the first manufacturer to successfully produce 
and offer IMO Tier III compliant four-stroke marine engines based on a fully 
modular SCR kit covering our entire four-stroke engine portfolio. In 2014, 
MAN Energy Solutions was awarded the first IMO Tier III EIAPP certificate 
together with the classification society DNV-GL.
 
MAN Energy Solutions’ standard SCR system is available in fourteen 
different sizes covering our entire portfolio of four-stroke engines. 
Customised SCR systems are offered on demand.
MAN has developed a complete range of SCR systems that work perfectly 
with our engines for maximum system efficiency. The intelligent exhaust 
gas temperature control allows significant savings in fuel consumptions as 
compared to third-party supplier systems. MAN SCR systems work with 
MGO, MDO and HFO with up to 3.5% sulphur. Our modular system comes 
in 14 different sizes to match all power demands. Some notable benefits of 
standardisation are significant cost reduction and simplification of 
installation.
Note: 
Stated SFOC/SGC values are valid for currently applicable rules acc. IMO

Urea consumption
The urea consumption depends on engine type, selected performance 
characteristics (engine map), in case of an engine with ECOMAP capability, 
operating profile, fuel type, ambient conditions, type of reduction agent, 
etc. 
For more detailed information on the expected level of urea consumption, 
please contact MAN Energy Solutions with your project specific request.
Conventional injection engines
Our well-established engine types are used in a vast array of applications 
all over the world. Based on long-term experience of historical proportions, 
our engines are in continuous development to increase power, reduce 
emissions, increase reliability, reduce fuel oil consumption, and increase 
longevity. Our engines are the prime movers of choice in the maritime 
sector.
Common rail (CR) engines
The flexibility of our CR technology enables a substantial improvement of 
the combustion process that improves the fuel economy and reduces 
emission levels. It is particularly advantageous in the low-load and mid-load 
ranges where our unique ECOMAP system (optional) applies different 
engine maps to reduce fuel consumption while observing IMO emission 
limits. Another feature is our patented Boost Injection. Our engine control 
system senses a load increase at a very early stage and tremendously 
improves the load response with the activation of boost injection by the 
common rail control. In addition, exhaust gas opacity is markedly reduced, 
far below the visibility limit. Our CR engines run efficiently on liquid fuels 
complying with ISO 8217 DMA, DMZ, and DMB, and on residual fuels (HFO) 
up to 700 cSt (in compliance with ISO-F-RMK 700).
Diesel oil (D) engines
The V28/33D STC features very favourable ratios of power-to-weight and 
power-to-installation space. The combination of low fuel consumption, low 
emissions and reduced life cycle costs makes this engine the ideal solution 
109
for propulsion in high speed ferries, naval and offshore patrol vessels. The 
V28/33D STC engine operates on distillates according to ISO 8217 DMA or 
equivalent fuel types.
With the MAN 175D, MAN Energy Solutions is presenting a new power pack 
setting future standards in the high-speed diesel engine market. The MAN
175D, developed especially for use in the shipping industry, is part of a 
product initiative aimed at providing MAN customers with a product 
portfolio that covers every power requirement, from high-speed diesel 
engines to low-speed diesel engines.
Sequential turbocharging (STC)
The MAN Energy Solutions sequential turbocharging system operates with 
two high-efficiency turbochargers. Depending on the amount of charge air 
required, the second turbocharger is switched on or off. In this way, the 
engine is operated at its optimum operating point over the whole applicable 
load range. 
The result is an extended operating envelope at low engine speeds, which 
gives a power reserve for ship acceleration, ship turning, sprints or towing. 
Furthermore, the STC system is characterised by a low thermal signature, 
decreased smoke emission, low vibrations and continuous low-load 
operation with reduced fuel consumption, which makes it the ideal solution 
for propulsion in naval applications and offshore patrol vessels.
Dual fuel (DF) engines
Dual fuel engines from MAN Energy Solutions run efficiently on liquid fuels 
or natural gas with very low emissions that are compliant with IMO limits.  
On gaseous fuel, the engines comply with IMO Tier III without the need for 
additional exhaust gas aftertreatment, and on liquid fuel they either fulfill 
IMO Tier II, or IMO Tier III together with an SCR system. The possibility to 
switch over seamlessly from gas to diesel operation and vice versa 
provides full flexibility in multiple applications.
All dual fuel engines can run on natural gas with a methane number higher 
than 80 without adjustments. For lower methane numbers, MAN Energy 
Solutions can deliver well-adapted solutions. The optimised combustion 
chamber ensures very low fuel consumption in both operational modes.

ECOLOAD advisory system
ECOLOAD is an advisory tool for marine powertrains (diesel-mechanic and 
diesel-electric) installed on-board the vessel on its own dedicated server 
hardware. Taking into account the current operating condition of the 
propulsion plant as well as input values entered by the operator, ECOLOAD 
calculates the optimum operating condition for the entire powertrain, and 
displays it via a graphical unit interface. On multi-engine plants, the 
holistically-optimised operation of the engines becomes very complex. In 
particular, engines with ECOMAP capability have a huge potential for lower-
ing fuel oil consumption and emissions. 
Typical features of the ECOLOAD advisory tool are recommendations 
regarding the selection of the best ECOMAP (diesel-electric powertrain) or 
best combinatory curve (diesel-mechanic powertrain) for the upcoming trip. 
Furthermore, ECOLOAD provides advice on the optimum load distribution 
for each engine and the optimum number of running engines highlighting 
potential opex savings and the lowest possible emissions.

Methane emissions
CH4 has a notably higher impact on the climate than CO2, and the emission 
of unburnt CH4 fuel not only reduces the overall operation efficiency, but 
also affects the environmental footprint of ship operation.
Modern low-pressure dual fuel four-stroke engines provide extensive 
means of controlling the combustion process. Due to the operating 
principle, CH4 emissions cannot be avoided completely. However, based on 
extensive expertise and experience, the latest MAN four-stroke dual fuel 
engines are designed to achieve the best possible results, for example: 
–	Halving of the CH4 slip
–	The newest developments have halved the values once more
–	Further development is successfully ongoing to reach yet another 50% 
reduction
–	Using smart vessel operation optimisation, effective emissions can be 
additionally reduced already today.
Biofuel
MAN engines are capable of operating on various kinds and shares of 
biofuel. Contact MAN Energy Solutions if this option is required.
Methanol 
MAN Energy Solutions is developing methanol technology paths for various 
engine types. Green methanol is an important fuel option to decarbonise 
the operation of propulsion and auxiliary GenSet equipment. Ensuring the 
feasibility of later retrofits can be crucial to avoid the risk of stranded assets 
by enabling the concurrent adaption of ships to expected regulations and 
fuel supply.
Products marked with 
 are intended to be available in future to 
be sold as methanol capable or will be intended to be available for retrofit to 
methanol operation under specific boundary conditions. 
Please contact MAN Energy Solutions for further details on the engines 
marked as methanol ready, the certifying class societies, and the currently 
expected availability of methanol ready for the individual marked engines.

Engine power
Engine brake power is stated in kW. 
Ratings are given according to ISO 3046-1.
According to ISO 15550, the power figures in the tables are valid within a 
range of ±3% up to tropical conditions at sea level, i.e.:
–	compressor inlet temperature 45°C
–	compressor inlet pressure 1,000 mbar 
–	seawater temperature 32°C
For all commercial medium speed propulsion engines the power is defined
according to the ICN1 definition (ISO 3046-1:2002: ISO standard power).
For all navy medium speed propulsion applications the engine rated power 
is stated as ICFN (ISO standard Continuous Fuel stop Net power), derived 
from standard ISO 3046-1:2002. It means the engine is capable to deliver 
power continuously during a period of time corresponding to the 
application. The engine is operated at stated speed and reference ambient 
conditions as stated above, while the fuel amount is limited and the fuel 
stop power cannot be exceeded. The engine rated power is delivered 
between the maintenance intervals as defined. The ICFN1 engine power 
rating description corresponds to 100% engine power output and cannot 
be exceeded.

Specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) and heat rate 
The stated consumption figures refer to the following reference conditions 
according to ISO 3046-1:
–	ambient air pressure:	
1,000 mbar
–	ambient air temperature:	 25°C (77 °F)
–	charge air temperature:	
according to engine type, corresponding to 
25°C cooling water temperature before CAC
The figures are given with a tolerance of +5% and without engine driven 
pumps. Additional fuel oil consumption must be considered for attached 
pumps and for engines directly driving dredge pumps.
In accordance with the NOX Technical Code 2008 of the International 
Maritime Organization, DM-grade fuel oil is used as reference fuel oil for 
engine tests and, thus, also forms the basis for the SFOC figures stated for 
engines in liquid fuel operation. 
Unless otherwise specifically stated, SFOC figures are based on a lower 
calorific value of the fuel oil of 42,700 kJ/kg and, in addition for engines with 
common rail injection (CR-engines), on DMA-grade fuel oil (ISO 8217). For 
engines with conventional fuel injection, SFOC figures are based on 
DMB-grade fuel oil (ISO 8217). For further details, please refer to our engine 
specific project guides available from MAN Energy Solutions. 
Specific lube oil consumption (SLOC)
The specific lube oil consumption is specified at MCR (maximum 
continuous rating) with a tolerance of 20%.
Blocking of output
Blocking of output is made for engines driving a propeller at 100% of the 
rated output. For engines powering an alternator, blocking of output is 
made at 110%. However, operation above 100% load is only recommended 
for a short period of time for recovery and prevention of a frequency drop.
115
Weights and dimensions
For marine main engines, the weights stated refer to engines without a 
flywheel. 
All weights given are without lube oil and cooling water. 
For auxiliary engines (GenSets), weights refer to the unit (including 
alternator). The weight of the GenSet may vary depending on the alternator 
make. 
The length of the GenSet unit depends on the alternator make. For a twin 
engine installation, the centreline distance is stated for each engine type.
The centreline distance for twin engine installation is given as a minimum 
value. Specific requirements to the passageway (e.g. of classification 
societies or flag state authority), seating type or a gallery can lead to higher 
values.

Methanol-ready
Ready when you are
Green methanol is one of the most promising future fuels, 
but not yet widely available. MAN methanol-ready engines 
keep your options open until then. 
The MAN 49/60DF, MAN 32/44CR, 35/44CD and MAN 175D 
run on conventional fuels with full emissions compliance. 
When market conditions are favorable to you, we can 
convert them to methanol.

MAN four-stroke marine GenSets – all emission requirements
Besides focus on power density and fuel economy, MAN Energy Solutions 
is committed to a steady reduction of the environmental impact of our 
engines.
IMO Tier II
MAN Energy Solutions has decreased NOX emissions significantly by 
applying well-proven methods that ensure a cleaner and more efficient 
combustion process. Our four-stroke propulsion engines are IMO Tier II 
compliant by internal engine measures alone. 
IMO Tier III
For operation in emission control areas (ECA), MAN Energy Solutions has 
developed a comprehensive range of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) 
systems that provides a tremendous reduction in NOX levels surpassing 
IMO Tier III requirements.
157
MAN Energy Solutions’ standard SCR system is available in fourteen 
different sizes covering our entire portfolio of four-stroke engines. 
Customised SCR systems are offered on demand.
MAN has developed a complete range of SCR systems that work perfectly 
with our engines for maximum system efficiency. The intelligent exhaust 
gas temperature control enables significant savings in fuel consumption as 
compared to third party supplier systems. MAN SCR systems work with 
MGO, MDO and HFO with up to 3.5% sulphur.

Fuel oil saving for small bore GenSet (part load optimised)
GenSets can be delivered with improved fuel oil consumption at low load 
and part load. The penalty will be higher SFOC at high load. The part-load 
optimised engine complies with the IMO Tier II limit.
The new tuning method, referred to as part-load optimisation, optimises the 
engine performance at approx. 60-65% MCR, as this is often the load 
range in which the GenSet is operating, but it can also be customised to 
other specific operating conditions.
With the new development of L21/31 Mk 2 together with part-load 
optimisation techniques, fuel oil savings of up to nearly 12 g/kWh have 
been obtained, depending on the engine type/model and load point.
Traditionally, GenSets are optimised at 80-85% MCR due to limitations in 
turbocharger matching, but this is also the load point where power 
management will engage additional GenSets when more power is needed.
With part-load optimisation, there is a fuel oil penalty when the load 
exceeds approx. 80% MCR, but this has no practical consequence as the 
GenSet rarely exceeds 85% MCR. 
This is illustrated in the figure below. For further information, please contact 
MAN Energy Solutions.

Electric and hybrid propulsion trains (HyProp ECO)
MAN Energy Solutions offers a full range of electric and hybrid power and 
propulsion plants. Our solutions are designed and optimised to meet the 
highest efficiencies of an integrated system covering the complete 
operational profile of the vessel. Our propulsion systems provide a 
well-balanced and tailor-made solution with emphasis on increased fuel 
efficiency, flexibility and performance. 
Our comprehensive propulsion packages include the complete array of 
required components from GenSets to propulsors, including 
switchboards, variable speed drives, propulsion motors and controls. 
They ensure the optimal technical and economical solution while 
minimising the operational costs.
The HyProp ECO introduces a system to control the power delivered by or 
to the shaft machine. It overcomes the constraint on constant speed 
propulsion machinery by utilising variable speed drives at the shaft 
generator/motor.
Our innovative HyProp Battery system also integrates batteries which 
enable an optimised loading of our engines, and provide an electric 
spinning reserve, dynamic support of the propellers as well as peak 
shaving.

Energy-saving electric propulsion (EPROX-DC) 
Recent developments in electric propulsion have resulted in electric 
systems where engines can operate at variable speed. The “classic” 
constant speed operation of GenSets is no longer a constraint. Utilising an 
enlarged engine operation map with a speed range of 60% to 100% paves 
the way to a high potential in fuel oil savings. Each speed set point of the 
engines can be adjusted independently in order to achieve a minimum fuel 
oil consumption according to the system load. The electric system using 
DC distribution enables a decoupled operation of the engines, propulsion 
drives, and other consumers. 
Another major advantage is the possible integration of energy storage 
systems, like batteries. They can reduce the transient loads on the engines 
and improve the dynamic response of the propulsion system. Fast load 
application is removed from the engines and load peaks are shaved. Also, 
emission free propulsion can be realized when running on the batteries. In 
addition, the energy storage system allows a constant and high loading of 
the engines, provides spinning reserve and will have a positive effect on 
engine maintenance.
MAN Energy Solutions offers this advanced package solution in close 
cooperation with our partner Aspin Kemp & Associates.

MAN L23/30H monocoque GenSet – continued development
The monocoque GenSet includes several updates of the tried and tested 
L23/30H engine, which are focused on weight reduction, vibration 
optimisation and simplified installation.
The most significant update is that the alternator is now a load-bearing 
component, with a ‘top brace’ connection to the engine. This enables up to 
63% weight reduction of the base frame, which again results in weight 
reduction of up to 13% of the GenSet and a lower vibration level.
The three and four point ‘deck-level’ supports significantly simplify the 
GenSet installation process. This design is installed on a flat deck, which is 
a major reduction of the vessels foundation structure. Furthermore, 
applying only three conicals makes the GenSets self-leveling.
The monocoque GenSet application is available for all variants of the 
L23/30H engine.

Marine fuels after 2020 (in accordance with ISO 8217)
From 1 January 2020, the global 0.5% limit for sulphur content in marine 
fuels enters into force. To ensure compliant operation, one of following 
methods must be used: 
–	 HFO GenSet running on a compliant low-sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) in 
accordance with ISO 8217.
–	 Global: max 0.5% sulphur (VLSFO).
–	 ECA: max 0.1% sulphur (ULSFO).
–	 HFO GenSet running on a high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) in accordance with 
ISO 8217 and with a SOX scrubber for exhaust gas cleaning.
–	 DF GenSet running on LNG with a compliant pilot distillate fuel.
MAN GenSets have for decades been running on low-sulphur and 
low-viscosity fuels on small power plants on Greenland. The many years of 
experience have been transferred to the standard marine GenSet. To be 
prepared for operation on compliant fuels after 2020, the HFO GenSets will 
be updated with optimised fuel pumps and inlet/exhaust valve materials for 
low-viscosity fuels.
It is important to note that paraffinic and aromatic fuels are incompatible 
and should not be mixed in the same fuel tank. Notice the issued Service 
Letters, PrimeServ Customer Information and follow MAN guidelines. 
ECAs – 0.10% S (effective 2015)

Methanol 
MAN Energy Solutions is developing methanol technology paths for various 
engine types. Green methanol is an important fuel option to decarbonise 
the operation of propulsion and auxiliary GenSet equipment. Ensuring the 
feasibility of later retrofits can be crucial to avoid the risk of stranded assets 
by enabling the concurrent adaption of ships to expected regulations and 
fuel supply.
Products marked with 
 are intended to be available in future to 
be sold as methanol capable or will be intended to be available for retrofit to 
methanol operation under specific boundary conditions. 
Please contact MAN Energy Solutions for further details on the engines 
marked as methanol ready, the certifying class societies, and the currently 
expected availability of methanol ready for the individual marked engines.

Moving big things 
to zero with five 
key technologies 
After 250 years engineering complex systems, 
we are ready for our biggest challenge:  
reducing emissions for essential industries. 
Our solutions are based on five technologies: 
producing green fuels in large volumes,  
making new engines to run on green fuels, 
retrofitting existing engines, capturing and 
processing CO2, and decarbonizing heat  
generation with heat pumps. Moving big  
things to zero is a big task but we have the 
experience, the technology, and the passion  
to get the job done.

Propeller programme – FPP and CPP  
 
 
The MAN Alpha FPP (Fixed Pitch Propeller) portfolio covers:
–	 power range of 4-50 MW per shaft
–	 blade configurations for 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-bladed propellers
–	 propellers with integrated shaft line and stern tube solutions
–	 a wide range of stern tube lube and sealing systems  
– oil, water, biodegradable oils
The MAN Alpha FPPs are characterised by the following benefits:
–	 High-efficient, hydrodynamically optimised blade profiles  
– Kappel designs available
–	 High reliability: robust approach with ample mechanical design margins
–	 High-efficient aft ship integration with rudder, rudder bulb, ducts, etc.
–	 Layouts for complete propulsion systems
–	 Plant calculations with upfront consideration to torsional vibration 
calculation (TVC), alignment and control systems
MAN Alpha CPP (Controllable Pitch Propeller)
–	 As standard Mk 5 versions are 4-bladed ­­– optionally 3- and 5-bladed 
propellers are available on request
–	 The figures stated after VBS indicate the propeller hub diameter
–	 Standard blade/hub materials are Ni-Al-bronze, stainless steel is optional
–	 The propellers are available up to the highest ice classes. However the 
standard programme, is based on ‘no ice’
–	 A wide range of stern tube lube and sealing systems are offered for oil, 
water and biodegradable oils.

Four-stroke propulsion system installation
MAN Alpha
Complete powertrain with propeller and aft ship equipment.
CFD model with streamlines and 
surface pressure distribution.
The hydrodynamic edge
In the complex hydrodynamic entity embracing hull, propeller, and rudder 
- our CFD-based software masters the holistic approach of customised 
blade and rudder bulb designs.
We perform ‘Resistance calculations’ and ‘Calculations of wake field’, 
which form the basis for the following:
	
– Final propeller design
	
– Self-propulsion calculations
	
– Cavitation extent calculations
	
– Propeller-induced pressure impulses and CIS (cavitation inception speed)
Save the ‘stock propeller test’; save time and save money.
With EcoBulb rudder bulb and propeller hub fairing cone installed, uniform 
flow without separation creates improved thrust ahead, and less power is 
required.

Market leader in two-stage 
turbocharging
Outstanding turbocharging efficiency
MAN ECOCHARGE two-stage turbocharging is suitable for high- and 
medium-speed engines of all fuel types and for application in all engine 
power ranges. Extremely high efficiencies and pressure ratios enable 
increased power density and improved key engine parameters. For 
example, it is possible to use a smaller engine for the same required power 
output or to achieve lower NOX emissions and lower specific fuel oil 
consumption (SFOC).
As a compact two-stage unit, the MAN ECOCHARGE delivers outstanding 
turbocharging efficiency. A variety of product types and sizes are available, 
ensuring the perfect turbocharger-to-engine-fit. MAN ECOCHARGE always 
consists of a clever combination of high- and low-pressure turbochargers. 
While MAN TCX has been specifically designed for high-pressure 
applications, MAN TCA and TCR as well as our new MAN TCT, TCF and 
TCP generation series round up the package as low-pressure 
turbochargers.

MAN ETB
MAN Energy Solutions
MAN turbochargers and exhaust gas systems
228
Specifically designed for EGR systems, the MAN ETB plays an important 
role in enabling these systems to reach the IMO Tier III emission limitation. 
The EGR blower is a core component of MAN Energy Solutions’ 
high-pressure EGR system that raises the exhaust gas pressure to 
overcome the pressure difference between exhaust gas and scavenge air 
receivers. In addition, the recirculated exhaust gas amount is controlled 
during the EGR operation by varying the blower speed. 
The desired EGR operating conditions are achieved by using a high-speed 
electric motor, directly coupled to the compressor wheel and speed 
controlled by a frequency converter. The scope of supply consists of the 
ETB and one cabinet with frequency converter and sine wave filter. 
The MAN ETB features a high-efficient blower wheel, optimized for the 
low-pressure ratios necessary for the high-pressure EGR system of a 
two-stroke combustion engine with materials designed to withstand 
corrosive agents caused by the sulphur content of fuels. As such, MAN’s 
ETB is suitable for high-pressure EGR engines of all fuel types and in all 
application ranges.

The maximum engine power output with one ETB depends on the EGR 
volume flow and the pressure difference between exhaust gas and 
scavenge air receivers. Therefore, an EGR blower selection tool will be 
introduced and the output will be available in CEAS soon.
For more information and blower assignment, please contact 
turbochargers@man-es.com.
ETB – explicitly designed for EcoEGR
MAN’s ETB is explicitly designed for EcoEGR applications where the blower 
will run continuously in both Tier III and Tier II Eco mode. This results in a 
compact and cost-optimised design with the highest availability.
In the SFOC-optimised Tier II Eco mode, the EGR volume flow is approx. 
50% of the required volume flow in Tier III mode. To cover the operating 
points of both running modes, the MAN ETB features an extremely wide 
compressor map.
The ETB achieves benchmark efficiencies and, therefore, minimises 
operational costs. 
For more information about EcoEGR, see the section EcoEGR in the 
chapter describing MAN B&W two-stroke propulsion engines.

MAN SCR
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is a method to reduce nitrogen oxides
(NOX) in the exhaust gas flow of engines to meet the required Tier III limits. 
SCR is the most common and approved system for achieving NOX 
reduction rates of up to 90%, suitable for power plants and marine 
applications.
MAN Energy Solutions has experience with both development and service 
of SCR systems. In 2017, the first SCR systems were introduced. There are 
two types of SCR layouts available:
–	 Low-pressure SCR-LP (after turbocharger)
–	 High-pressure SCR-HP (before turbocharger)

MAN SCR-LP 
MAN Energy Solutions is the first manufacturer to successfully produce 
and offer IMO Tier III compliant four-stroke marine engines based on a fully
modular SCR kit covering our entire four-stroke engine portfolio. In 2014,
MAN Energy Solutions was awarded the first IMO Tier III EIAPP certificate 
together with the classification society DNV-GL.
MAN Energy Solutions’ standard SCR system is available in fourteen 
different sizes covering our entire portfolio of four-stroke engines.
Customised SCR systems are offered on demand.
MAN has developed a complete range of SCR systems that work perfectly 
with our engines for maximum system efficiency. The intelligent exhaust 
gas temperature control allows significant savings in fuel consumption 
compared to third-party supplier systems. MAN SCR systems work with 
MGO, MDO and HFO with up to 3.5% sulphur.
Our modular system comes in 14 different sizes to match all power 
demands. Some notable benefits of standardisation are significant cost 
reduction and simplification of installation.
Urea consumption
The urea consumption depends on engine type, and selected performance 
characteristics (engine map). For an engine with ECOMAP capability it 
depends on, operating profile, fuel type, ambient conditions, type of 
reduction agent, etc.
For more detailed information on the expected level of urea consumption, 
please contact MAN Energy Solutions with your project specific request.

MAN SCR-HP 
SCR-HP system 
The MAN SCR-HP is a small and compact NOX emission reduction system. 
The most compact design in the market allows for easy integration, and 
the few frame sizes will cover the entire two-stroke portfolio up to 25 MW 
per SCR reactor.
The integrated mixing unit reduces the overall length and volume. The 
specific honeycombs ensure a compact design.
The MAN SCR-HP can be mounted in all positions and is capable of 
running on all fuels.
Auxiliary components like the urea injection lance, urea dosing unit and 
urea pump module are from MAN’s well-proven SCR-LP system.

MAN VTA
MAN VTA (variable turbine area) allows charge air delivery to allows charge 
air delivery to be precisely, steplessly and continously  optimised to the 
demand for charge air at all engine loads and speeds. MAN VTA minimizes 
fuel consumption and related exhaust emissions.
Flexible air and fuel management is key to meeting the emissions legislation 
of the future while increasing engine performance and reducing specific 
fuel oil consumption (SFOC). In heavy fuel oil applications, VTA technology 
has a powerful and positive role to play.
Benefits
–	 Reduced consumption: up to 5 g/kWh lower fuel consumption
–	 Reduced emissions: lower soot and smoke emission and lower particle 
emissions
–	 Easy application: suitable for MAN TCA and TCR turbochargers and 
retrofit packages

It all starts with a tiny anomaly, and sooner or later, it will have 
consequences: performance degradation, safety hazards, or even 
failure and downtime.
What if you could receive an alarm to stop your engine in real time? And 
then do something about it in time to prevent serious damage? 
How do you detect tiny anomalies between planned maintenances, like a 
bearing seizure, cylinder scuffing, slight wear of components, water 
presence, fuel pollution, soot pollution, etc.? 
Now you can. Now there’s MAN Fluid Monitor for lube oil.
MAN Fluid Monitor for lube oil has been awarded cybersecurity certification 
– IACS UR E27-Sep 2023.

A dual-fuel conversion is one of the most effective ways to drive greater 
efficiency and profitability from your fleet. In this process, we convert your 
existing diesel engine to a dual-fuel gas engine. This enables you to switch 
between diesel and gas as necessary, to both reduce operational costs and 
take advantage of optimal fuel prices as they arise.
Using alternative fuels, such as SNG, LNG, ethane, LPG, or methanol, 
greatly reduces SOX, NOX, CO2, and particulate matter, enabling you to 
comply with global environmental regulations, secure worldwide port 
access, and meet your own sustainability targets. 
Our dual-fuel retrofit solutions are not limited to the main engine, and 
customised projects can be provided as a turnkey solution, or including gas 
systems in partnership with MAN Cryo. To ensure the process is executed 
seamlessly from start to finish, MAN PrimeServ covers everything from 
research and site survey to engineering and project management, and 
finally to hardware commissioning.
